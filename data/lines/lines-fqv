Er, well, it's sort of hard to explain, Lorna.
I suppose you could say part teacher, part visionary, part firebrand, part friend.
Right.
And do you get paid for that?
Oh, I wouldn't accept payment, Ken.
That would be...
That would be weird.
You know Cuckoo's been travelling for, like, 12 years.
He's been absolutely everywhere.
You must have seen a lot.
You know, I have.
But, Ken, Lorna, would you like to know the longest journey I've ever taken?
Well, go on, then.
Tell us.
The journey into my mind.
Yes, it was lonely and perilous, and the only map I had was my own heart.
Aw!
Yeah.
She's married, Ken.
She got married!
We need to stay calm, Lorna.
He seems like an interesting guy.
Maybe it'll be fine.
You encouraged her to go on that gap year.
She went away with everything in front of her.
Now she's wrecked her life and I didn't get to see the wedding.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Rachel.
Hi, Rach.
So, you like him?
Like him?
We love him.
I mean, we don't even know him yet but I'm sure, in time...
So we're wondering, um, what are your plans?
Where are you thinking of living, et cetera?
Dylan!
You sister's home from Thailand.
Oh, you all right, Rach?
See the Amazon?
No, Dylan, I didn't see the Amazon.
Missed a trick there, then, didn't you?
I did get married.
So?
What, am I supposed to congratulate you?
Anyone could get married.
I could get married.
Congratulate me.
But you didn't get married.
But I could, so fuck off.
So, plans?
Cuckoo and I were thinking we could stay here with you.
I could switch university, somewhere local.
Obviously I'm going to have to reapply and then, in three years, when I'm qualified, we're going to do something like set up a leper colony in some violent, war-torn failed state where no westerners go because it's, like, too dangerous.
Well, I'm glad you've thought it through.
Yay!
So that's sorted, then.
Yeah.
I think it's going to be all right, Lorna.
It's a bit of a shock, a bit sudden, but I think we'll get used to it.
In fact, I'm starting to feel more relaxed about it already, really.
I mean, it's fine.
It's no biggie.
That hurts, Ken.
Hm?
I said that hurts.
What?
Mmm!
You know, the fishermen of Phuket have a saying.
"Once a woman enters her 40s, her food is her lovemaking."
Very tasty, Lorna.
Oh, thank you, Cuckoo!
You're welcome.
What is this?
It's lamb noisettes.
No, what is this?
It's a jacket potato!
Jack-et potato?
Yeah.
Well, Lorna, I have to say...
It's fucking delicious!
Oh, thanks!
Jack-et potato.
So, um, what's with the stupid name?
Dylan!
Dylan's asking if Cuckoo's your real name.
You want to know my birth name?
Well, my birth name is Dale Ashbrick.
Dale Ashbrick?
Actually, kind of a funny story.
A few years back...
Oh, not this bit.
..I was boating on the Moctezuma River with some of these Huichol...
Cuckoo!
Not this bit.
No, it's fine, your mum and dad are people of the world.
So I'd just taken a triple dose of the hallucinogen peyote...
Are you with me, Ken?
Yes.
Great.
I'm out on the river and I'm buzzing like a handsaw...
HE IMITATES HANDSAW
Like, engine, brain, together, molecules.
And suddenly, I realised...
I am not a person.
I am all people.
I'm not sure I understand that, Cuckoo.
I am all people, you know?
So I am me, Dale Ashbrick, but I'm also you, Lorna, and you, Dylan, and you, Rachel, my wife, and I am you, Ken.
Well, obviously not literally.
Hey, I'm not sitting here bullshitting you, Ken!
I am you and I am in you.
I'm deep... ..inside you.
Right there.
Anyways, once I realised I was all people,
I decided it didn't matter what my name was.
Right.
Well, if it didn't matter what your name was, why did you bother changing it?
Well, I guess I was just high!
Jack-et potato!
Ah, lovely.
Here we are.
A little vino.
A little wine.
There you go, Cuckoo.
Thanks.
So, Rachel, Cuckoo, I suppose I should say a few words.
Ooh, actually, Dad, Cuckoo is going to make a toast.
Yeah, do you mind, Dad?
No, please.
Great.
Could you just...?
Everyone have a seat.
I gave this speech on our wedding day.
Now I'd like to give it again with clothes on, and you, our family, present.
'Rachel' by Cuckoo.
What can I say about Rachel, your only daughter?
Rachel is unique, she's loving, she's enthusiastic, she's adventurous, always seeking new things, new ways of doing things.
This girl's the kind of girl who says yes to EVERYTHING.
She's open, welcoming, warm inside.
She can be fiery.
Oh, God!
I mean, sometimes, you cannot hold her down.
She's frisky, never standoffish, and finally, and most importantly, grateful.
Well, wow!
Relieved mum right here.
What?
!
You like him?
He may be a little unconventional, but he's winning and inspiring and profound.
We should never have doubted Rachel.
Oh, that speech!
It made me feel 16 again.
He reminds me of...
Oh, who's that author I like, Ken?
Jane Austen.
Yes.
And you remember that book, the one I really liked?
Pride And Prejudice.
Yes.
Well, there was this one particular character.
I confess I had a little bit of a...
Mr Darcy.
Yes!
Yes, Ken.
Cuckoo reminds me of Mr Darcy.
See, I didn't really see it that way.
I found him a little...vapid.
Vapid?
Were we at the same dinner?
Come on, grumpy.
You never like anyone at first.
Maybe I am judging him too quickly.
I'll take him out tomorrow morning, we'll have some fun.
Good idea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
HEADBOARDS BANG IN DISTANCE
Lorna?
Yes.
Can you hear that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Ohhh!
Oh, God, England!
Here I come!
Oh, yes!
Am I allowed to go and stop them?
Is that allowed?
Come on, Ken, she's married.
YEAH!
Remember when you and I were like this?
I mean, not exactly like this.
Never lasted anything like this long.
Goodnight.
I'll move them to Dylan's room tomorrow.
I'll buy him something, soften the blow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
ARRRGHHH!
Rachel, you feel so good!
Oh, God!
Ken?
Yes, love?
Do you think he's got a big one?
Please go to sleep.
ARRRGHHH!
We'll be back about four.
All right.
Have a good time.
We will.
Mwah.
(Good luck.)
HE SIGHS
Cuckoo.
I thought we could take the car out for a drive, see the sights, get to know each other.
I've brought you a cup of tea.
Cuckoo.
Wakey-wakey.
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.
GET OUT!
HE YELLS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE
Get out!
GET OUT!
Oh!
(What did you do?
)
Ken, I am so embarrassed about what happened.
I'm always like that when I'm woken, you know, cranky.
Cuckoo, it's water under the bridge.
I'm just not an early morning type of person, you know?
I think it's because I have so many profound thoughts that my brain needs time to regenerate.
My late father used to bring me up here, you know, in the '80s.
He was old school left, you know, proper Black Country.
Me, I was one of those new romantics.
Surprised you, huh?
Yeah, I had it all, the long hair, painted fingernails.
Can I stop you there, Ken?
You're not holding my attention.
Oh.
I just meant it's very beautiful up here, isn't it?
I mean...
I've done a lot of thinking up here.
Yeah, I guess it's just a question of perspective, though, right?
Because when you've spent two months yak-tracking through the Himalayas, places like this just look a bit...shit.
You know?
Anyway, just one guy's opinion.
It is just beautiful.
I keep pinching myself.
Thanks, Mum.
You've thanked me already, Dilly.
I know, but I'm just always so locked up in my head with all these thoughts of existence and shit, and you still look after me and give me cool stuff.
I really love you, Mum.
You silly, Dilly, woo-woo.
I need you and Rachel to swap rooms.
You're fucking shitting me?
It's only a room, Dylan.
It's my room.
I've worked on it.
It's got ambience.
Is ambience a new word for smells of wank?
I don't wank.
I don't.
Mum, I have never wanked.
Of course you haven't, Dilly.
Do it for me.
Do it for your Mum-Mum.
Rachel mentions you're writing a book.
Mm, about my political philosophies, yeah.
It's going to be the most important book of the 21st century.
Is it?
Yeah, I just need a little bit more time.
I figure I'll stay with you guys for a couple of years, make sure I get enough sleep, keep my brain strong.
I'll get there.
Right.
But obviously you can't expect to stay with us indefinitely, so...
No.
Kenderson, may I call you Kenderson?
No.
Ken, I'm a great believer in society.
So am I. Oh, great.
Awesome.
So, in the most basic human societies, you would have hunters, you know, people like you, guys that were good at the simple stuff.
You know, there - food, there - money, go get.
Urgh!
You know?
But then, at the same time, you would have the thinkers, you know?
They weren't good at hunting, just like I'm not good at jobs, but they would eat the food provided by the hunters and in exchange they would think up a lot of really cool stuff for the future and shit.
And that's me, Ken.
Thinker.
Hunter.
Hunter.
Thinker.
Yeah?
Right.
I'm going to have to pick you up on a few things.
Like what?
Hello-oh!
Did you have a good time?
Oh, you love him, don't you?
It went bad.
What's wrong, Ken?
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
I just want to spend some time on my bed relaxing.
No, I can tell something's wrong.
He refuses to work, Lorna.
Who?
Cuckoo?
Of course, Cuckoo.
Who else would I mean?
Mr Dunn from the office.
Mr Dunn?
What?
You're always complaining about him.
Dunn Nothing - that's what you call him.
KNOCK ON DOOR
It's Rachel, I'm coming in.
I think your father would like a bit of privacy.
Did you tell Cuckoo he had to get a job?
No.
No!
Well, yes.
Yes, he did.
You weren't even there, Lorna.
I wasn't there.
Don't blame me.
Dad, you have got no right to interfere in my life like that.
Interfere?
Yes, interfere.
You have brought a man I have never met before into my house.
He's never going to leave.
He expects me to pay his way.
By comparison with that, what I did is not interfering.
It is like a gentle grope.
Or, if what I have done is interfering, then what you have done is like...
..a rape.
You have raped your mother and me.
Rachel, ignore your father.
You haven't raped me.
OK, then, you don't have to worry about Cuckoo paying our way because I'm going to get a job.
You can't.
You're going to university.
Well, obviously not.
You need somebody to pay the rent.
Cuckoo needs to concentrate on his book, so it has to be me.
Oh, don't be stupid!
You don't have to pay the rent.
Oh, even better!
I can put some money aside, and Cuckoo and I can get a place of our own, away from you.
I don't know, Rach.
I mean, maybe your dad's right.
In a lot of ways, all I've ever really done is travel and party.
I mean, maybe it's arrogant to think I can just write a book and solve all the world's problems.
Baby, I don't want you ever thinking like that.
You're a genius.
HE SIGHS
I know.
I know.
I tried my new room.
I don't like it.
Give it a bit longer than two hours, eh, Dylan?
Ken, why are you sitting in the dark?
This Cuckoo guy is ruining everything.
Why can't we just pay him off, send him back to Thailand?
Dylan, he's Rachel's husband and we all love him.
Why does he want to be here anyway, living with you two and married to Rachel who,
I don't want to be rude, is a massive dog?
Just give him some money and he'll be out of here.
I would be.
I'm going to pretend you never said that.
Cuckoo's family now.
This is the man who will father our grandchildren, be there for us in our old age, carry your father's coffin.
Tell him, Ken.
Ken!
What?
Yes, Dylan, it's an absurd idea.
Anyone home?
Hello?
Cuckoo.
Hey, Ken!
Come here, come here.
Sit, sit.
It's whale music.
Oh.
Um...
Wait, wait.
Wait.
Ah!
I love that part.
HE CHUCKLES
What's up?
OK.
So I was thinking about our conversation yesterday.
Yes.
We argued, and in that white heat of emotion, we discovered a bond.
Did we know each other in a previous life Ken?
I don't think so.
I wonder.
Maybe we were brothers.
You were small, weak, frightened by everything, but I was strong.
I saved your life.
Many times.
So about yesterday -
I came away thinking that your world and my world are different places.
So different, yeah.
But in my world, very different from yours, Rachel had really good prospects.
She was going to Bristol University, which she worked really hard for.
Ken, I love Rachel very much.
And then I thought about you.
You must miss Thailand.
Sometimes.
Yeah!
Cooped up in this house, far away from your home, and then I thought maybe if you had some money things would be different.
You'd be able to go your own way and Rachel - maybe she'd be happier, too.
Do we, um, understand each other?
I think we do.
So...
Oh, Ken, I-I don't think I can take this.
She needs a guy who can support her.
You feel bad about this now, but if you really love her, Cuckoo, you'll make the sacrifice.
Just take the money, walk out of that door, it's as simple as that.
Goodbye, Cuckoo.
'Rach, there's no easy way for me to say this.'
Cuckoo told me this morning that he was considering...
What?
..leaving you, going back to Thailand without you.
No.
Yeah.
He, he told me he could never feel at home here.
He told me to tell you that he loved you, but that being with him wasn't your path.
He said he wanted you to go to university, set yourself up, marry someone nice, maybe a doctor or a lawyer, someone with a steady income.
Maybe a Villa supporter.
Cuckoo said that?
I don't know.
It was something like that.
I...
I was just so emotional at the time, it was so sad to see him go.
Is that a bonfire in the garden?
Cuckoo left some of his stuff.
I couldn't leave it hanging around.
Rachel would find it too painful.
You'll be all right, love.
I won't.
You will.
I won't!
DYLAN:
She might not be.
Dylan!
What?
I'm just saying, she's been married now.
Kind of used goods.
If we lived in a Muslim state, we'd probably have to stone her.
SHE SOBS
Rachel, however much you love Cuckoo, your mum and I love you just as much.
You'll get through this because I will do anything, anything, to make you happy, in the long run.
Thanks, Dad.
HORN BEEPS
Cuckoo, what's going on?
I thought we had a deal.
We did, and here it is!
You likey?
Cuckoo!
You're back!
God!
Where have you been?
Rach, your dad was right.
If I'm not willing to support you, I don't deserve you.
What's this?
It's a jack-et potato van.
I mean, who knew?
Apparently you can sell them out of a van.
It's perfect!
You're going to sell jacket potatoes?
Yes.
That is, Lorna, if you'd honour me with the recipe?
Yes, of course!
Great.
Then it's settled!
Only cost me 10,000 squids.
ã10,000?
I know.
A steal, right?
Cuckoo, where did you get the money?
Dad gave it to me.
Dad?
!
You gave Cuckoo ã10,000 to set up a business?
Yes.
Surprise!
(ã10,000, Ken?
)
Yes.
Because...
I was saying that he didn't have a job and so...
Well, why did you tell me he'd gone back to Thailand?
And why did you burn all his stuff?
You burnt my stuff, Ken?
Why would you do that?
To...make it an even bigger surprise!
You should see your faces!
It's all worked out exactly as I planned.
Oh!
Oh!
You funny man.
Yeah!
Well, come on, let's get inside.
LAUGHTER
KEN SIGHS
Well, it's me and you, Ken.
Burnt my stuff!

Previously on "Switched at birth"...
You never told us that Ty enlisted.
And by putting you on the basketball team,
Buckner qualifies for a $20,000 grant.
So the only reason that they wanted me on the team was because I'm deaf?
- You're moving out?
- I think we both need a break.
- Hey, Daphne.
- This is Monica.
- I know her from...
- They told us we could change in here.
- Who did?
- I didn't steal your watch.
Stop it!
Cut it out!
Hey!
What the hell is going on?
I think we just set some sort of record for suicides.
Those weren't suicides.
That was attempted murder.
Listen up!
Now despite all the chatter on the court, this practice was not my way of punishing you all for Saturday's loss to Oaks Glen.
It's my way of getting us ready for the playoffs, which means
I'm shaking up the starting line-up.
No positions are a lock.
We'll be scrimmaging, running drills and facing off in one-on-one contests.
He's making us play each other to see who starts.
This is great, this could be your chance!
Here's the list of match-ups.
We'll start Wednesday.
So?
I'm going up against Ava for point guard.
And you are going up against Jenna for small forward.
Jenna?
Nobody's better at posting up than she is.
Hey, we are both going to be in that starting line-up.
Thanks.
I am serious, Daphne.
We will practice as much as you need.
You don't know me...
I'm like a dog with a bone when I want something.
- And you want me to start with you?
- Absolutely.
You're my girl.
I'm sorry we fought the other day.
It's just that everything with Angelo was exploding and I think I may have
Taken it out on you.
Wow, you just polished off like a vineyard-worth of grapes.
Oh hi, Emmett.
It's nice to see you.
Hi, sweetheart.
Oh, to have the metabolism of a 17-year-old boy.
I don't think he's eaten a lot of meals lately.
You know what?
Let me make you something good.
How about some rosemary-garlic chicken?
Just takes 15 minutes.
No no no, he's fine.
You're fine, right?
You don't want anything.
I saw that.
One rosemary-garlic chicken coming up!
So, Emmett, what's new?
How's school?
Family...
He has a lot of homework
- and he has to take a family portrait.
- I saw.
I get it.
Can't use your family because...
I'm sorry.
I didn't know things were that bad.
- Me neither.
- You know, Emmett, we could use a new family portrait because we don't have one with Daphne
- and Regina.
Do you think maybe...
- No.
- Use our family for your assignment?
- No no no no no.
Huh-uh!
No.
She's just using this as a way to get to know you.
No.
- So?
- So...
Fine, there's always "Sound of music" night.
He'd make a great Kurt.
Okay okay okay... family portrait.
Family portrait.
So?
What do you think?
Nice.
What do you call this?
Bedhead?
Whatever it is, I appreciate your vision.
And thank you.
I appreciate you calling it a vision.
When you deal with artists all day it becomes an essential part of your vocabulary.
Artists.
What do you do?
I just opened a gallery at the crossroads... medium west.
- Oh, fancy.
- I'm going for edgy.
Oh, then you should check out the fringe festival.
Last year some guy shaved his head, set the hair on fire and then ** the ashes back onto his head.
Okay, that's the kind of thing that gives both artists and hair transplants a bad name.
But I'll check it out.
I love finding new artists.
Um, I'm sure you get this all the time, but would you be willing to meet with a young artist?
Maybe give some advice or feedback?
Does he show at a gallery here in town?
She is not with anyone right now.
Her name is Bay Kennish.
She's my daughter but just so you don't think I'm some proud mom pimping out her daughter...
I mean, I am proud, but she really is talented.
This is a mural she just did.
Wow, kind of a chicano-socialist vibe.
I like it.
I would be happy to check out her studio,
- see what else she's done.
- And you're not just saying that because I'm the one with the scissors?
No.
But people are interested, honey.
Mom, no one is gonna read your book to find out how Toby Kennish is dealing with the switch.
It's about all of us.
How one family was turned upside down and still managed to land on its feet.
That's a line from my book proposal.
- When do I get to read that?
- When it's done.
Not to be a nudge, but you should get that to the publishers sooner than later.
I know, I know, I know.
Sarah Lazar is probably writing away but I'm not gonna race just to beat her it has to be right.
Honey, I'm just trying to help.
And what happened to all of our food?
Uh, okay.
Toby, what's the biggest change you've experienced since you found out about the switch?
And how has it changed you?
I don't know.
The only thing I can think of is that with all the drama it's kinda allowed me to fly under the radar.
Have we been ignoring you, honey?
It's just you guys have had a lot on your plate.
I didn't want to add to that.
We should do something...
just the three of us...
Like go to the science museum or...
skeet shooting.
You always loved skeet shooting, honey.
- So we can...
- Let me just re-phrase my answer.
When we first found out about the switch,
I was questioning everything.
It was like I was living on quicksand, but now, thanks to my very attentive parents, I'm back on solid ground.
- You're not getting out of this.
- You're welcome.
I think it was Bay who was into skeet shooting.
I look like a ho.
What are you talking about?
You look awesome!
You have got to stop with the stripes and the orange.
First of all, it's persimmon.
- And I like the stripes.
- You've got these adorable arms that you hide in cardigans all the time.
It's crazy.
Hello...
- Hi!
- Hey, mom.
I'm Simone.
I've heard so much about you!
Uh, Regina.
Hi.
- Wow.
- It's Simone's.
Yeah, I figured.
Doesn't she look amazing?
You know what?
You would look amazing in that too.
Your mom has a killer bod!
I would die for your boobs.
Thank you.
And I love what you've done with the place!
Thank god you got rid of all those squirrels.
Yikes, right?
Yeah, it just wasn't me.
Um, do you want to stay for dinner?
I totally would, but I gotta run.
I've got a wax at 5:00.
I'll see you tomorrow, right, Daphne?
Okay.
It was really nice to meet you, and seriously, keep the dress.
I just wanted to show you a few examples of what we've done in the past.
That was Bay before she figured out how to use a hair dryer.
This is when Toby fell on the playground and cut his face up so we all dressed up like pirates with bloody scars to match.
"You guys are really cute."
Thank you.
But now we are in your hands this time.
I know that you're going to want to do something a little more arty than... and the whole point of the assignment is to say something about family, right?
This family, so...
"Don't worry about my assignment."
"I want to take a good photo..."
for me.
Thank you.
Okay.
I know I'm going to get in huge trouble if I ask you anything personal, but I...
She's not here, so ask you.
Okay.
Have you ever dated... dated a hearing girl before?
No.
And you didn't date Daphne, right?
"Just friends."
I was never very comfortable with Bay's old boyfriend.
Ty... whew.
You know Ty?
I feel a little guilty saying this, but I was relieved when he left.
But Bay was just so sad and her heart was broken.
And then you... you came along.
Thank god.
He is coming by to see some of my stuff.
The problem is I can't figure out what I should show him.
Uh... oh, this one...
This one people really like.
But that could mean that it's too obvious.
This one... yeah?
I could really talk about this one, but sometimes curators like the piece to speak for itself.
It would be amazing to have something in a real gallery.
You know?
With real artists appreciating it.
There'd be an opening and reviews!
Well, hello, buzzkill.
I know that people see my street art, but it's anonymous.
Which I love but... sometimes I would like to be known as something other than the girl who was switched at birth.
Are you okay?
Did my mom say something?
She did.
She totally did.
No, what did she say?
Hey, c'mere!
What's up?
What's so urgent about this practice?
I hired Lotte Macomb to coach us.
Holy crap.
The one who played for Stanford?
And who coaches at U.M.K.C.
If anyone can teach you how to post-up, it's her.
I... you seriously hired her to coach us?
We have her for three hours.
That is so cool, but I don't think I can help split the cost with you.
Dude, not to worry.
I got it covered.
- Simone, that's...
- Seriously, don't worry about it.
Remember that watch that I thought had been stolen?
I found it in my leather jacket.
And my dad had already bought a new one so I sold it and voilà... private lessons.
Well, do you think we should tell coach Medlock?
I mean, everybody thinks those girls from East Riverside stole it.
We were the ones who got in trouble, not them.
C'mon, we are wasting valuable Lotte Macomb coaching time.
Let's go!
- Hey.
- Hi.
So you know I'm doing the hit-fest for the flintport animal shelter tomorrow?
- Yeah?
- And I was thinking maybe you'd like to come with me.
I got a solo gig at this thing called Treads Threads and, um, I need to practice for that.
C'mon, you can play guitar anytime.
Actually, dad, it's kind of important.
Yeah well, hit-fest is kind of important.
Toby, the puppies of flintport need you.
C'mon, it'll be fun.
You and me on the baseball diamond... it's been awhile, huh?
Okay.
So this one was inspired by Miro.
I can see that.
Nice work.
Thanks.
And this one,
I was kind of playing with the idea of what's text versus what's an image.
See the m-a-n?
Kind of a twist on Jenny Holzer.
- Right!
- I can't believe you even used me in the same sentence.
I love her.
I showed a couple of her pieces back in New York.
I'll bring you by a catalog from the show.
Oh my god.
That would be amazing.
This is definitely one of my favorite pieces.
Have you ever considered representing artists?
You're very good.
Bay's work does not need a rep.
It sells itself.
- Nice.
- You should probably go before she starts bragging about the doodles on my notebooks.
Those aren't just doodles.
Those are abstract sketches.
- She's clearly passionate.
- And?
And very talented.
That's an impressive body of work for a 16-year-old.
She paints almost every waking moment.
So I'm still trying to figure out where I can find some authentic Kansas City barbecue.
Oh, there are so many!
My favorite is a hole-in-the-wall called Alabama Al's.
There's also Jack Stack.
You gotta get the cheesy corn.
And I'm also trying to figure out who I can share it with.
Oh, um...
I...
I have to check my work schedule.
Is that code for you're seeing somebody or otherwise entangled?
Nope.
No entanglements at all.
Okay.
I'll consider it a date.
Okay, all right, here we go.
- Great job, dad.
- Thank you.
You're up.
- What?
- I'm not doing this by myself.
My boy Toby's going to take some swings.
- Come on, let's go.
- No...
- Okay.
- All right.
All right, slow that machine down for him now.
Hi.
Sorry, I just have to get my phone.
Come on in.
Take your time.
Wow, nice place.
Oh yeah, it's not really mine.
Hello?
Oh, hello.
I left that blue peacoat here and it's starting to get chilly.
Mom, this is Patrick.
Patrick, this is my mom Adrianna.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
- I'm sorry I interrupted.
- No, mom, you're not.
You're never interrupting.
Patrick is opening a gallery at the crossroads and I wanted him to see Bay's work.
Oh, Bay's so talented.
And Regina too.
- Did she show you any of her work?
- Ma, please.
- You're an artist too?
- No.
I dabbled back in the day.
She more than dabbled.
Look at this.
It's filled with her artwork.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
I'm used to mom's pimping their daughters.
See how the colors change?
And look how it catches the light.
This is a strong piece.
Are these shards of glass?
- Yeah.
- Anyway I should get that coat.
Mom... um, Patrick, would you mind waiting outside for just a second?
Oh, of course not.
Nice meeting you, Adrianna.
Mom, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Maybe I overstepped by calling about Angelo.
Okay, let's just move on.
I lost my temper and I miss you.
Daphne misses you.
Would you... move back?
Do you really think I needed that coat?
C'mere.
Damn.
Heads up.
Hey, Monica.
What's up?
Didn't you hear?
We've been banned.
Banned?
What do you mean?
We're not allowed to practice here anymore since someone accused us of stealing a watch.
But...
Uh, where are you practicing now?
I don't know.
All the private schools are freaked out, thinking we're a bunch of thugs and thieves.
We're just screwed, I guess.
I'm really sorry about all this.
Whatever.
Not your problem.
See you around.
We have to tell someone.
Tell someone what?
That you found your watch.
Daphne, don't you remember how pissed coach got when we accused those girls?
He'll just get mad again and take it out on us.
And we're not exactly in a position to be on his bad side.
Besides, the damage is done.
But we can undo it.
If those girls don't have a place to practice, they can't compete.
- They'll find somewhere.
- Simone.
I'm not telling coach.
It was our bad and it's over.
Let it go.
If you don't tell him...
If I don't tell him, what?
I'm serious, Daphne.
Let it go.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
What happened between you and Simone, can you just tell me?
Uh, it's kinda long.
Please.
In eighth grade there was this girl,
Alisha Jelline.
She wore these weird barrettes by her ears and her uniform was like way longer than her knees.
Simone, uh, convinced me that we should give her a makeover.
This girl let you?
She was desperate to be friends with us.
And then what?
And then we asked her who she liked.
It took awhile to get it out of her, but it was this hockey player Tim Burke.
And we convinced her that she should practice asking him out and film it.
You didn't.
Alisha told the camera how cute she thought he was, how sexy, how she thought about him all the time.
It was humiliating to watch even in private.
And I begged Simone to delete it after Alisha left.
- But...
- She sent it around anyway.
It jumped from school to school.
I think the whole city saw it.
And Alisha left a month later.
I never should've let Simone talk me into doing it.
I still feel sick when I think about it.
And we never really hung out much after that.
Uh...
Simone Sinclair is not someone you want as an enemy, but she's not really someone you want as a friend either.
I feel like we should go shoot some shotguns after this, get the whole red-state tour.
I hate guns, but I'm actually a pretty good shot.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Oh, you have a little...
Okay, so what did you really think of Bay's work?
I mean is she on the right track?
She obviously has talent.
She's just 16.
I mean, there's only so many things you can paint about at that age.
You think she'll be able to make a go of it as an artist?
Yeah, someday.
She just needs more time.
Most curators... or at least myself...
I'm looking for artists that have something unique to say...
Okay.
Like that painting of yours.
It was clearly about something pretty deep.
I'm a recovering alcoholic and I painted that when I was getting sober.
The shards of glass in the painting are from broken liquor bottles.
That's what I'm talking about.
You went through something and it was all there on the canvas...
the pain, frustration, the light at the end of the tunnel.
I was just trying to find something to do so I didn't drink again.
- Do you want more baked beans?
- I'm serious.
That painting would go great in a show I'm putting together.
It's all about turning points.
I think it would really fit in well.
I'm serious.
Think about it.
Come in.
- Oh.
- Hey!
I'm really glad you're home!
So how'd it go?
What did he say?
I'm dying to hear.
Should I call him?
Should I email him?
Should I send him...
I was thinking like this handmade card and I wanted to thank him for ever...
What?
He thinks that you are really talented.
- He hated my stuff.
- No no no.
Regina, I can walk across the driveway for platitudes.
He thought it was really impressive...
- But?
- But you're 16.
What does that mean?
He felt like, you know, maybe you hadn't figured out exactly what your work was trying to say.
That's just 'cause he didn't ask me.
We mostly talked about style...
Honey, your stuff is way more sophisticated than mine was in my 20s.
So you agree with him.
For my age, it's good?
No no!
Oh god, okay.
It's not coming out right.
He thinks that you have a lot of promise.
Look, this is just one man's opinion.
- Right.
No, I know.
- Bay.
No!
You know what?
It's cool.
At the end of the day I appreciate honesty, so... thanks.
So you missed the first few pitches.
You slammed the last, like, five or six.
It's not about my at-bat.
It was watching you.
I forgot how good you are.
Thanks?
I would have killed for that kind of talent.
You had that kind of talent.
And I made a career out of it.
Why'd you drop it?
Dad, you pushed and you pushed.
- You took all the fun out of it.
- Come on.
I wanted you to reach your potential.
No, dad, baseball was always gonna be your thing.
If I was ever any good, it was because I was John Kennish's son.
And if I wasn't, then it would be a blemish on your legacy.
- That is ridiculous.
- This is not about you.
No, I am trying to talk to you about what you could have done with all that talent.
Seems to me like you threw that away for nothing.
Oh, that's right, dad.
That's what I did.
I threw it all away for nothing.
I feel like I should tell you something.
Simone's watch... the one that she thought was stolen... it wasn't.
It was just lost and...
- And she found it.
- Yeah.
Simone already told me.
She also told me that you two sold the watch and used the money to pay for a private trainer for yourselves.
- I had that same reaction.
- That's not what happened.
Really?
So you didn't use the money for a private session with the coach from U.M.K.C.?
Well, yes, but...
And she did that, what?
Out of the goodness of her heart?
No, but I didn't...
I went out on a limb to put you in this team, and I'm starting to regret that decision.
You put me on the team because I'm deaf and the school gets disability funding.
Y'know what?
You're right.
Let's start clean.
- Okay.
- With this new round of tryouts,
- it'll be all about your playing.
- Good.
I'm ready for Jenna.
Actually, I was thinking you'd be a better point guard.
So I'll be up against...
- Simone.
- Is that a problem?
No, not at all.
- Regina.
- I'm all done.
Thanks again.
Any time.
Bay just told me what happened with your gallery friend.
He's not exactly my friend.
I'm just...
I'm not sure what you were you thinking.
Excuse me?
Why did you get her hopes up?
I mean, c'mon.
What serious gallery is going to show the work of a high school student?
I just wanted him to take a look at her stuff.
Feedback is good for artists.
I didn't realize that she was hoping he would show her.
Well, she was.
And she's devastated.
You should have never invited him over here like that.
What, so we're never supposed to encourage her to show her work to anyone?
Of course not, but we could nurture her, build up her self-esteem.
Kathryn, rejection hurts no matter how good your self-esteem is and, unfortunately, rejection is 99% of being an artist.
So we should just throw her to the wolves now, teach her a lesson?
She took a risk showing her stuff to Patrick and even if he didn't fall in love with it, she put herself out there.
That's hard.
And I am proud of her for trying.
Please don't use those dryer sheets!
They ruin the machine.
Hey, you came!
How did you escape your dad and Olivia?
So that art guy?
He thinks that I don't have anything to say, but I do.
This is what I have to say...
my street art.
So I'm going to put this up across the street from his gallery.
I don't care.
I just...
I want to show him or I want to show me or something.
I don't know.
But that's the thing about street art.
I don't need anybody's approval,
I just put it out there and I see what happens.
Okay, what is going on?
You're officially being terse.
Ty?
Why are you asking me about Ty?
My mom?
I'm gonna kill her.
What did she say?
No.
I don't know.
If we were, it was for like a month at the most.
What does it matter anyway?
He's half a world away.
We didn't sleep together, which you know because I told you I'm a vegetable.
A virgin.
I met him right as everything happened.
He was somebody for me to talk to.
He was somebody who was outside of my world.
You knew that I was into Ty when you kissed me, but it doesn't matter because I'm over him and I'm into you.
Do you want to come with me and help put this one up?
I heard we're going up against each other for point guard?
- Yeah.
- How did that happen?
What do you mean?
He changed his mind I guess.
Wait, you knew you had trouble posting up so you convinced him to let you go out for guard.
- I would never do that.
- I have done everything for you and this is how you repay me?
I'm sorry things turned out this way.
What do you want me to do?
Tell him you don't want to go out for guard.
I'm not doing that.
Wow, I guess you're not the friend that I thought you were.
Let me ask you something...
where did coach Medlock get the idea that selling the watch for the lesson was my plan?
I never said that.
You probably misunderstood him.
He doesn't move his lips very much when he talks.
That's quite a stare you got going on there.
- How's the book proposal coming?
- Fine.
I wonder when my security clearance is going to be high enough for me to read that.
Really, who am I kidding?
Sarah Lazar is the real writer.
- What?
- It's probably best if I just have this as my own private way of dealing with everything that's happened.
Like a journal.
Sweetie, Sarah Lazar doesn't know this family the way that you do.
I think dropping it would be a huge mistake.
But you know what?
I'm not gonna push you to do something you don't want to do.
Thanks.
Why do you think Toby quit baseball?
Did I push him too hard?
I don't think that's why he stopped playing.
I think he found other interests, like his music.
His music?
What's so wrong about that?
Well, you know, best case he's a rock star wearing leather pants till he's 60.
Worst case, he's playing on street corners collecting change in an empty guitar case.
John, it's his dream.
Yeah.
Ah, the tyranny of the blank canvas.
Oh, hey.
- The catalog with the Jenny Holzer in it.
- Thanks.
Uh, hey, I think I drove by your gallery.
It's on 17th street, right?
Yeah, 17th and Baltimore.
There was this really cool piece of street art on a wall nearby.
It was this girl...
I think she was holding a hammer.
- Yeah, somebody put it up last night.
- Really?
I was hoping to leave all the banksy wannabes behind in New York,
- but apparently they're everywhere.
- Banksy wannabes?
No, it was cute.
Huh.
Well, I thought it was kind of cool.
So I guess Kansas City artists weren't all that you were hoping they'd be.
I've actually been excited by a few.
Patrick?
What are you doing here?
I was dropping off a catalog with Bay.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.
I became a curator for this exact reason... to stumble upon a piece that stays with you.
This is my first show here, I want to make a splash and I want your piece in my show.
Look, I appreciate your determination here.
- Can I ask what the hesitation is?
- Bay.
Well, it's not like it's your piece versus hers.
I'm responding to your painting.
I know that.
You're not a mother.
I just don't see how neither of you being in the show makes you a good mom.
All right, thank you, ladies.
Next Sinclair and Vasquez...
Sinclair takes the ball out first.
You want me to tell you when he blows the whistle?
That's okay.
He'll blow it again after I score on you.
Ready to post up?
Looks like those Lotte Macomb lessons are really paying off, huh?
Huh.
Yes, they are.
Damn it!
Wait, he's putting something of yours in his show?
I'm not sure.
I mean I'm thinking about it.
I wanted you to know, but I promise you none of this was planned.
He was at my place and my mom showed it to him...
There goes Adrianna again...
sticking her nose in everything.
Hold on.
I am sorry for how all this happened, but I really did want to show him your work.
- Whatever, Regina.
- Everything I said to him about your stuff is true.
Honey...
You know what I don't get?
Angelo just left.
What?
Am I the only one who cares that he's gone?
I thought you were in love with him or was that an act too?
Hey, watch your tone with me.
You went on a date with this guy?
What happens when Angelo comes back?
That man walked out on us... again.
He could've stayed and fought, but he didn't.
He just took off.
So what are you saying?
He's never coming back?
Hey, guys, Emmett's here.
It's family photo time.
Come on.
So I got the spot.
I'm gonna be starting.
Well, that's great!
That's fantastic.
That's fan-tastic.
I guess so.
I mean yes, it is.
Yeah, good for you.
Hey hey, Toby.
So your mom got tickets for the Treads Threads thing.
And I was hoping maybe you could score us some, you know, floor passes for the show?
There aren't any floor passes.
Oh, I didn't know.
Look, I'm...
I'm try...
I'm trying.
Dad, you let me convert part of the garage into a music studio,
I play every day.
I just don't get why you don't see how serious I am about this.
I don't know anything about music.
I don't know anybody.
I don't have any connections.
- I can't help you.
- Dad, I don't need you to help me.
I just need you to get it.
Thank you, Emmett.
I'm so excited to see them.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Is this still about Ty?
I'm sorry that everyone was so annoying.
Sure.
Have things really been that bad with your parents?
Did you just say...
I'm sorry.
This is about you and your family.
What... just, um... keep going.
Did you just say
"Are we going to fall out of love?"
meaning we are currently...
Me too.
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...
You never told us that Ty enlisted.
And by putting you on the basketball team,
Buckner qualifies for a $20,000 grant.
So the only reason that they wanted me on the team was because I'm deaf?
[No.]
[I checked prices online.]
[You just keep punishing me.]
[That's not true.]
[i didn't vandalize that billboard.]
[Sell what?
]
[My motorcycle.]
- You're moving out?
- I think we both need a break.
- Hey, Daphne.
- This is Monica.
- I know her from...
- They told us we could change in here.
- Who did?
- I didn't steal your watch.
Stop it!
Cut it out!
Hey!
What the hell is going on?
I think we just set some sort of record for suicides.
Those weren't suicides.
That was attempted murder.
Listen up!
Now despite all the chatter on the court, this practice was not my way of punishing you all for Saturday's loss to Oaks Glen.
It's my way of getting us ready for the playoffs, which means
I'm shaking up the starting line-up.
No positions are a lock.
We'll be scrimmaging, running drills and facing off in one-on-one contests.
He's making us play each other to see who starts.
This is great, this could be your chance!
Here's the list of match-ups.
We'll start Wednesday.
So?
I'm going up against Ava for point guard.
And you are going up against Jenna for small forward.
Jenna?
Nobody's better at posting up than she is.
Hey, we are both going to be in that starting line-up.
Thanks.
I am serious, Daphne.
We will practice as much as you need.
You don't know me...
I'm like a dog with a bone
You're my girl.
I'm sorry we fought the other day.
It's just that everything with Angelo was exploding and I think I may have
Taken it out on you.
[Friendly fire.]
[It happens.]
Wow, you just polished off like a vineyard-worth of grapes.
Oh hi, Emmett.
It's nice to see you.
Hi, sweetheart.
Oh, to have the metabolism of a 17-year-old boy.
I don't think he's eaten a lot of meals lately.
You know what?
Let me make you something good.
How about some rosemary-garlic chicken?
Just takes 15 minutes.
No no no, he's fine.
You're fine, right?
You don't want anything.
[I mean... if she wants to.]
I saw that.
One rosemary-garlic chicken coming up!
So, Emmett, what's new?
How's school?
[Okay.]
[I have a lot of homework.]
[Science.]
[Photography.]
[I have to take a family portrait.]
Family...
He has a lot of homework and he has to take a family portrait.
I saw.
I get it.
[But I can't use my family.]
Can't use your family because...
I'm sorry.
I didn't know things were that bad.
- Me neither.
- You know, Emmett, we could use a new family portrait because we don't have one with Daphne
- and Regina.
Do you think maybe...
- No.
- Use our family for your assignment?
- No no no no no.
Huh-uh!
No.
She's just using this as a way to get to know you.
No.
- So?
- So...
Fine, there's always "Sound of music" night.
He'd make a great Kurt.
Okay okay okay... family portrait.
Family portrait.
[Switched at Birth]
So?
What do you think?
Nice.
What do you call this?
Bedhead?
Whatever it is, I appreciate your vision.
And thank you.
I appreciate you calling it a vision.
When you deal with artists all day it becomes an essential part of your vocabulary.
Artists.
What do you do?
I just opened a gallery at the crossroads... medium west.
- Oh, fancy.
- I'm going for edgy.
Oh, then you should check out the fringe festival.
Last year some guy shaved his head, set the hair on fire and then ** the ashes back onto his head.
Okay, that's the kind of thing that gives both artists and hair transplants a bad name.
But I'll check it out.
I love finding new artists.
Um, I'm sure you get this all the time, but would you be willing to meet with a young artist?
Maybe give some advice or feedback?
Does he show at a gallery here in town?
She is not with anyone right now.
Her name is Bay Kennish.
She's my daughter but just so you don't think I'm some proud mom pimping out her daughter...
I mean, I am proud, but she really is talented.
This is a mural she just did.
Wow, kind of a chicano-socialist vibe.
I like it.
I would be happy to check out her studio,
- see what else she's done.
- And you're not just saying that because I'm the one with the scissors?
No.
But people are interested, honey.
Mom, no one is gonna read your book to find out how Toby Kennish is dealing with the switch.
It's about all of us.
How one family was turned upside down and still managed to land on its feet.
That's a line from my book proposal.
- When do I get to read that?
- When it's done.
Not to be a nudge, but you should get that to the publishers sooner than later.
I know, I know, I know.
Sarah Lazar is probably writing away but I'm not gonna race just to beat her it has to be right.
Honey, I'm just trying to help.
And what happened to all of our food?
Uh, okay.
Toby, what's the biggest change you've experienced since you found out about the switch?
And how has it changed you?
I don't know.
The guess the only thing I can think of is that with all the drama it's kinda allowed me to fly under the radar.
Have we been ignoring you, honey?
It's just you guys have had a lot on your plate.
I didn't want to add to that.
We should do something...
just the three of us...
Like go to the science museum or...
skeet shooting.
You always loved skeet shooting, honey.
- So we can...
- Let me just re-phrase my answer.
When we first found out about the switch,
I was questioning everything.
It was like I was living on quicksand, but now, thanks to my very attentive parents, I'm back on solid ground.
- You're not getting out of this.
- You're welcome.
I think it was Bay who was into skeet shooting.
I look like a ho.
What are you talking about?
You look awesome!
You have got to stop with the stripes and the orange.
First of all, it's persimmon.
- And I like the stripes.
- You've got these adorable arms that you hide in cardigans all the time.
It's crazy.
Hello...
- Hi!
- Hey, mom.
I'm Simone.
I've heard so much about you!
Uh, Regina.
Hi.
Wow.
It's Simone's.
Yeah, I figured.
Doesn't she look amazing?
You know what?
You would look amazing in that too.
Your mom has a killer bod!
I would die for your boobs.
Thank you.
And I love what you've done with the place!
Thank god you got rid of all those squirrels.
Yikes, right?
Yeah, it just wasn't me.
[Please be nice.]
Um, do you want to stay for dinner?
I totally would, but I gotta run.
I've got a wax at 5:00.
I'll see you tomorrow, right, Daphne?
Okay.
It was really nice to meet you, and seriously, keep the dress.
[Are all the Buckner girls like that?
]
[She's really nice.]
[She was nervous.]
[That girl?
Nervous?
I doubt it.]
[You push me to make new friends,] [then I do, and you criticize them.]
[I'm sorry, I'm sorry.]
I just wanted to show you a few examples of what we've done in the past.
That was Bay before she figured out how to use a hair dryer.
This is when Toby fell on the playground and cut his face up so we all dressed up like pirates with bloody scars to match.
"You guys are really cute."
Thank you.
But now we are in your hands this time.
I know that you're going to want to do something a little more arty than... and the whole point of the assignment is to say something about family, right?
This family, so...
"Don't worry about my assignment."
"I want to take a good photo..."
for me.
Thank you.
Okay.
I know I'm going to get in huge trouble if I ask you anything personal, but I...
She's not here, so ask you.
Okay.
Have you ever dated... dated a hearing girl before?
No.
And you didn't date Daphne, right?
"Just friends."
I was never very comfortable with Bay's old boyfriend.
Ty... whew.
You know Ty?
I feel a little guilty saying this, but I was relieved when he left.
But Bay was just so sad and her heart was broken.
And then you... you came along.
Thank god.
He is coming by to see some of my stuff.
The problem is I can't figure out what I should show him.
Uh... oh, this one...
This one people really like.
But that could mean that it's too obvious.
This one... yeah?
I could really talk about this one, but sometimes curators like the piece to speak for itself.
[They're all good.]
It would be amazing to have something in a real gallery.
You know?
With real artists appreciating it.
There'd be an opening and reviews!
[Sometimes reviews aren't good.]
Well, hello, buzzkill.
[I'm sorry.]
[Keep going.]
I know that people see my street art, but it's anonymous.
Which I love but... sometimes I would like to be known as something other than the girl who was switched at birth.
[i get it.]
Are you okay?
Did my mom say something?
She did.
She totally did.
[No, no.
Your mom was great.]
No, what did she say?
[She is great.]
[I'm just tired.]
[I'll talk to you later.]
Hey, c'mere!
What's up?
What's so urgent about this practice?
I hired Lotte Macomb to coach us.
Holy crap.
The one who played for Stanford?
And who coaches at U.M.K.C.
If anyone can teach you how to post-up, it's her.
I... you seriously hired her to coach us?
We have her for three hours.
That is so cool, but I don't think I can help split the cost with you.
Dude, not to worry.
I got it covered.
- Simone, that's...
- Seriously, don't worry about it.
Remember that watch that I thought had been stolen?
I found it in my leather jacket.
And my dad had already bought a new one so I sold it and voilà... private lessons.
Well, do you think we should tell coach Medlock?
I mean, everybody thinks those girls from East Riverside stole it.
We were the ones who got in trouble, not them.
C'mon, we are wasting valuable Lotte Macomb coaching time.
Let's go!
- Hey.
- Hi.
So you know I'm doing the hit-fest for the Flintport animal shelter tomorrow?
- Yeah?
- And I was thinking maybe you'd like to come with me.
I got a solo gig at this thing called Treads Threads and, um, I need to practice for that.
C'mon, you can play guitar anytime.
Actually, dad, it's kind of important.
Yeah well, hit-fest is kind of important.
Toby, the puppies of Flintport need you.
C'mon, it'll be fun.
You and me on the baseball diamond... it's been awhile, huh?
Okay.
So this one was inspired by Miro.
I can see that.
Nice work.
Thanks.
And this one,
I was kind of playing with the idea of what's text versus what's an image.
See the m-a-n?
Kind of a twist on Jenny Holzer.
- Right!
- I can't believe you even used me in the same sentence.
I love her.
I showed a couple of her pieces back in New York.
I'll bring you by a catalog from the show.
Oh my god.
That would be amazing.
This is definitely one of my favorite pieces.
Have you ever considered representing artists?
You're very good.
Bay's work does not need a rep.
It sells itself.
- Nice.
- You should probably go before she starts bragging about the doodles on my notebooks.
Those aren't just doodles.
Those are abstract sketches.
She's clearly passionate.
And?
And very talented.
That's an impressive body of work for a 16-year-old.
She paints almost every waking moment.
So I'm still trying to figure out where I can find some authentic Kansas City barbecue.
Oh, there are so many!
My favorite is a hole-in-the-wall called Alabama Al's.
There's also Jack Stack.
You gotta get the cheesy corn.
And I'm also trying to figure out who I can share it with.
Oh, um...
I...
I have to check my work schedule.
Is that code for you're seeing somebody or otherwise entangled?
Nope.
No entanglements at all.
Okay.
I'll consider it a date.
[WELCOME] [John Kennish!
]
Okay, all right, here we go.
- Great job, dad.
- Thank you.
You're up.
- What?
- I'm not doing this by myself.
My boy Toby's going to take some swings.
- Come on, let's go.
- No...
- Okay.
- All right.
All right, slow that machine down for him now.
Hi.
Sorry, I just have to get my phone.
Come on in.
Take your time.
Wow, nice place.
Oh yeah, it's not really mine.
Hello?
Oh, hello.
I left that blue peacoat here and it's starting to get chilly.
Mom, this is Patrick.
Patrick, this is my mom Adrianna.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
- I'm sorry I interrupted.
- No, mom, you're not.
You're never interrupting.
Patrick is opening a gallery at the crossroads and I wanted him to see Bay's work.
Oh, Bay's so talented.
And Regina too.
- Did she show you any of her work?
- Ma, please.
- You're an artist too?
- No.
I dabbled back in the day.
She more than dabbled.
Look at this.
It's filled with her artwork.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
I'm used to mom's pimping their daughters.
See how the colors change?
And look how it catches the light.
This is a strong piece.
Are these shards of glass?
- Yeah.
- Anyway I should get that coat.
Mom... um,
Patrick, would you mind waiting outside for just a second?
Oh, of course not.
Nice meeting you, Adrianna.
Mom, I'm so sorry.
No, I'm sorry.
Maybe I overstepped by calling about Angelo.
Okay, let's just move on.
I lost my temper and I miss you.
Daphne misses you.
Would you... move back?
Do you really think I needed that coat?
C'mere.
Damn.
Heads up.
Hey, Monica.
What's up?
Didn't you hear?
We've been banned.
Banned?
What do you mean?
We're not allowed to practice here anymore since someone accused us of stealing a watch.
But...
Uh, where are you practicing now?
I don't know.
All the private schools are freaked out, thinking we're a bunch of thugs and thieves.
We're just screwed, I guess.
I'm really sorry about all this.
Whatever.
Not your problem.
See you around.
We have to tell someone.
Tell someone what?
That you found your watch.
Daphne, don't you remember how pissed coach got when we accused those girls?
He'll just get mad again and take it out on us.
And we're not exactly in a position to be on his bad side.
Besides, the damage is done.
But we can undo it.
If those girls don't have a place to practice, they can't compete.
- They'll find somewhere.
- Simone.
I'm not telling coach.
It was our bad and it's over.
Let it go.
If you don't tell him...
If I don't tell him, what?
I'm serious, Daphne.
Let it go.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
What happened between you and Simone, can you just tell me?
Uh, it's kinda long.
Please.
In eighth grade there was this girl,
Alisha Jelline.
She wore these weird barrettes by her ears and her uniform was like way longer than her knees.
Simone, uh, convinced me that we should give her a makeover.
This girl let you?
She was desperate to be friends with us.
And then what?
And then we asked her who she liked.
It took awhile to get it out of her, but it was this hockey player Tim Burke.
And we convinced her that she should practice asking him out and film it.
You didn't.
Alisha told the camera how cute she thought he was, how sexy, how she thought about him all the time.
It was humiliating to watch even in private.
And I begged Simone to delete it after Alisha left.
- But...
- She sent it around anyway.
It jumped from school to school.
I think the whole city saw it.
And Alisha left a month later.
I never should've let Simone talk me into doing it.
I still feel sick when I think about it.
And we never really hung out much after that.
Uh...
Simone Sinclair is not someone you want as an enemy, but she's not really someone you want as a friend either.
I feel like we should go shoot some shotguns after this, get the whole red-state tour.
I hate guns, but I'm actually a pretty good shot.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Oh, you have a little...
Okay, so what did you really think of Bay's work?
I mean is she on the right track?
She obviously has talent.
She's just 16.
I mean, there's only so many things you can paint about at that age.
You think she'll be able to make a go of it as an artist?
Yeah, someday.
She just needs more time.
Most curators... or at least myself...
I'm looking for artists that have something unique to say...
Okay.
Like that painting of yours.
It was clearly about something pretty deep.
I'm a recovering alcoholic and I painted that when I was getting sober.
The shards of glass in the painting are from broken liquor bottles.
That's what I'm talking about.
You went through something and it was all there on the canvas...
the pain, frustration, the light at the end of the tunnel.
I was just trying to find something to do so I didn't drink again.
- Do you want more baked beans?
- I'm serious.
That painting would go great in a show I'm putting together.
It's all about turning points.
I think it would really fit in well.
I'm serious.
Think about it.
Come in.
- Oh.
- Hey!
I'm really glad you're home!
So how'd it go?
What did he say?
I'm dying to hear.
Should I call him?
Should I email him?
Should I send him...
I was thinking like this handmade card and I wanted to thank him for ever...
What?
He thinks that you are really talented.
- He hated my stuff.
- No no no.
Regina, I can walk across the driveway for platitudes.
He thought it was really impressive...
- But?
- But you're 16.
What does that mean?
He felt like, you know, maybe you hadn't figured out exactly what your work was trying to say.
That's just 'cause he didn't ask me.
We mostly talked about style...
Honey, your stuff is way more sophisticated than mine was in my 20s.
So you agree with him.
For my age, it's good?
No no!
Oh god, okay.
It's not coming out right.
He thinks that you have a lot of promise.
Look, this is just one man's opinion.
- Right.
No, I know.
- Bay.
No!
You know what?
It's cool.
At the end of the day I appreciate honesty, so... thanks.
So you missed the first few pitches.
You slammed the last, like, five or six.
It's not about my at-bat.
It was watching you.
I forgot how good you are.
Thanks?
I would have killed for that kind of talent.
You had that kind of talent.
And I made a career out of it.
Why'd you drop it?
Dad, you pushed and you pushed.
- You took all the fun out of it.
- Come on.
I wanted you to reach your potential.
No, dad, baseball was always gonna be your thing.
If I was ever any good, it was because I was John Kennish's son.
And if I wasn't, then it would be a blemish on your legacy.
- That is ridiculous.
- This is not about you.
No, I am trying to talk to you about what you could have done with all that talent.
Seems to me like you threw that away for nothing.
Oh, that's right, dad.
That's what I did.
I threw it all away for nothing.
I feel like I should tell you something.
Simone's watch... the one that she thought was stolen... it wasn't.
It was just lost and...
- And she found it.
- Yeah.
Simone already told me.
She also told me that you two sold the watch and used the money to pay for a private trainer for yourselves.
- I had that same reaction.
- That's not what happened.
Really?
So you didn't use the money for a private session with the coach from U.M.K.C.?
Well, yes, but...
And she did that, what?
Out of the goodness of her heart?
No, but I didn't...
I went out on a limb to put you in this team, and I'm starting to regret that decision.
You put me on the team because I'm deaf and the school gets disability funding.
Y'know what?
You're right.
Let's start clean.
- Okay.
- With this new round of tryouts,
- it'll be all about your playing.
- Good.
I'm ready for Jenna.
Actually, I was thinking you'd be a better point guard.
So I'll be up against...
- Simone.
- Is that a problem?
No, not at all.
- Regina.
- I'm all done.
Thanks again.
Any time.
Bay just told me what happened with your gallery friend.
He's not exactly my friend.
I'm just...
I'm not sure what you were you thinking.
Excuse me?
Why did you get her hopes up?
I mean, c'mon.
What serious gallery is going to show the work of a high school student?
I just wanted him to take a look at her stuff.
Feedback is good for artists.
I didn't realize that she was hoping he would show her.
Well, she was.
And she's devastated.
You should have never invited him over here like that.
What, so we're never supposed to encourage her to show her work to anyone?
Of course not, but we could nurture her, build up her self-esteem.
Kathryn, rejection hurts no matter how good your self-esteem is and, unfortunately, rejection is 99% of being an artist.
So we should just throw her to the wolves now, teach her a lesson?
She took a risk showing her stuff to Patrick and even if he didn't fall in love with it, she put herself out there.
That's hard.
And I am proud of her for trying.
Please don't use those dryer sheets!
They ruin the machine.
Hey, you came!
How did you escape your dad and Olivia?
[They're out.]
They didn't even know I left.[]
So that art guy?
He thinks that I don't have anything to say, but I do.
This is what I have to say...
my street art.
So I'm going to put this up across the street from his gallery.
[He won't know you did it.]
I don't care.
I just...
I want to show him or I want to show me or something.
I don't know.
But that's the thing about street art.
I don't need anybody's approval,
I just put it out there and I see what happens.
Okay, what is going on?
You're officially being terse.
[I didn't think that you] [and Ty were serious.]
Ty?
Why are you asking me about Ty?
My mom?
I'm gonna kill her.
What did she say?
[Were you two serious?
]
No.
I don't know.
If we were, it was for like a month at the most.
What does it matter anyway?
He's half a world away.
[It matters to me.]
We didn't sleep together, which you know because I told you I'm a vegetable.
A virgin.
I met him right as everything happened.
He was somebody for me to talk to.
He was somebody who was outside of my world.
[That's it?
]
[just a guy with good timing?
]
You knew that I was into Ty when you kissed me, but it doesn't matter because I'm over him and I'm into you.
[Okay.]
Do you want to come with me and help put this one up?
[Your street art cost me my motorcycle already.]
[I think I'll sit this one out.]
[I'll talk to you later.]
I heard we're going up against each other for point guard?
- Yeah.
- How did that happen?
What do you mean?
He changed his mind I guess.
Wait, you knew you had trouble posting up so you convinced him to let you go out for guard.
- I would never do that.
- I have done everything for you and this is how you repay me?
I'm sorry things turned out this way.
What do you want me to do?
Tell him you don't want to go out for guard.
I'm not doing that.
Wow, I guess you're not the friend that I thought you were.
Let me ask you something...
where did coach Medlock get the idea that selling the watch for the lesson was my plan?
I never said that.
You probably misunderstood him.
He doesn't move his lips very much when he talks.
That's quite a stare you got going on there.
- How's the book proposal coming?
- Fine.
I wonder when my security clearance is going to be high enough for me to read that.
Really, who am I kidding?
Sarah Lazar is the real writer.
- What?
- It's probably best if I just have this as my own private way of dealing with everything that's happened.
Like a journal.
Sweetie, Sarah Lazar doesn't know this family the way that you do.
I think dropping it would be a huge mistake.
But you know what?
I'm not gonna push you to do something you don't want to do.
Thanks.
Why do you think Toby quit baseball?
Did I push him too hard?
I don't think that's why he stopped playing.
I think he found other interests, like his music.
His music?
What's so wrong about that?
Well, you know, best case he's a rock star wearing leather pants till he's 60.
Worst case, he's playing on street corners collecting change in an empty guitar case.
John, it's his dream.
Yeah.
Ah, the tyranny of the blank canvas.
Oh, hey.
- The catalog with the Jenny Holzer in it.
- Thanks.
Uh, hey, I think I drove by your gallery.
It's on 17th street, right?
Yeah, 17th and Baltimore.
There was this really cool piece of street art on a wall nearby.
It was this girl...
I think she was holding like a hammer.
- Yeah, somebody put it up last night.
- Really?
I was hoping to leave all the banksy wannabes behind in New York,
- but apparently they're everywhere.
- Banksy wannabes?
No, it was cute.
Huh.
Well, I thought it was kind of cool.
So I guess Kansas City artists weren't all that you were hoping they'd be.
I've actually been excited by a few.
Patrick?
What are you doing here?
I was dropping off a catalog with Bay.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.
I became a curator for this exact reason... to stumble upon a piece that stays with you.
This is my first show here, I want to make a splash and I want your piece in my show.
Look, I appreciate your determination here.
- Can I ask what the hesitation is?
- Bay.
Well, it's not like it's your piece versus hers.
I'm responding to your painting.
I know that.
You're not a mother.
I just don't see how neither of you being in the show makes you a good mom.
All right, thank you, ladies.
Next Sinclair and Vasquez...
Sinclair takes the ball out first.
You want me to tell you when he blows the whistle?
That's okay.
He'll blow it again after I score on you.
Ready to post up?
Looks like those Lotte Macomb lessons are really paying off, huh?
Huh.
Yes, they are.
Damn it!
Wait, he's putting something of yours in his show?
I'm not sure.
I mean I'm thinking about it.
I wanted you to know, but I promise you none of this was planned.
He was at my place and my mom showed it to him...
There goes Adrianna again...
sticking her nose in everything.
Hold on.
I am sorry for how all this happened, but I really did want to show him your work.
- Whatever, Regina.
- Everything I said to him about your stuff is true.
Honey...
You know what I don't get?
Angelo just left.
What?
Am I the only one who cares that he's gone?
I thought you were in love with him or was that an act too?
Hey, watch your tone with me.
You went on a date with this guy?
What happens when Angelo comes back?
That man walked out on us... again.
He could've stayed and fought, but he didn't.
He just took off.
So what are you saying?
He's never coming back?
Hey, guys, Emmett's here.
It's family photo time.
Come on.
[Bay and Daphne in the middle.]
[I don't want to be in the middle.]
So I got the spot.
I'm gonna be starting.
Well, that's great!
That's fantastic.
That's fan-tastic.
I guess so.
I mean yes, it is.
Yeah, good for you.
Hey hey, Toby.
So your mom got tickets for the Treads Threads thing.
And I was hoping maybe you could score us some, you know, floor passes for the show?
There aren't any floor passes.
Oh, I didn't know.
Look, I'm...
I'm try...
I'm trying.
Dad, you let me convert part of the garage into a music studio,
I play every day.
I just don't get why you don't see how serious I am about this.
I don't know anything about music.
I don't know anybody.
I don't have any connections.
- I can't help you.
- Dad, I don't need you to help me.
I just need you to get it.
[I'll send you these later, okay?
]
Thank you, Emmett.
I'm so excited to see them.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Is this still about Ty?
[It's not about anything.]
[I should go.]
[Get these going.]
I'm sorry that everyone was so annoying.
[What are you talking about?
]
[You've got a great family.]
Sure.
[I'm serious.]
Have things really been that bad with your parents?
[My mom and dad were in love.]
[Now they aren't.]
[How does that even happen?
] [Does it always happen?
]
[Are we going to fall out of love?
]
Did you just say...
I'm sorry.
This is about you and your family.
What... just, um... keep going.
[Did I say what?
]
Did you just say "Are we going to fall out of love?"
meaning we are currently...
[I am]
Me too.
[Angelo Missed Call]
[Hi mom, how's it going?

I'm not playing anything, okay?
I'm sorry for manipulating you.

I'm here to pay my debt, that's it.

Well, at least he got outta here, right?
I mean, maybe now he can get some real help.
Whoop!
And maybe not.
Raquel:
What is he doing back here?
He should still be in the hospital.
Do you think he's mad at me?
Why, because of the whole... fake-caring and betrayal and whatnot?
No, I'm sure he's totally fine with that.
That's why he took all those pills -
Because of how fine he was.

Beth:
This is the first place we stopped
When we got here.
I just, I thought...
I don't know,
I thought that maybe he'd come back to where we started.
It's stupid, I know.
I just-
It's not stupid.
No, it is!
I know it is, I just...
I don't know where else to look.
We've looked everywhere!
Where could he have gone?
This isn't how it was supposed to happen.
When I was ten, my parents wouldn't let me get a dog, so I gathered up all my essentials -
I got a... compass, flashlight...
Tv from the kitchen - and I made a run for it.
Where did you go?
I made it to the playground at the end of the street, holed up under the slide till I had to go to the bathroom.
Everyone runs away when they're ten.
But what if he doesn't come back?
Maybe you should call your dad.
Beth:
And do what?
Why would you say that?
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Okay, okay.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I...
I'm just trying to help.
Connor:

Can I come back now?

Grab a seat, buddy.
There's something we wanna talk to you about.
Connor:
If it's about where babies come from,
I already know.
Eric and I are getting back together.
Yeah, I kinda gathered that.
My publicists held a focus group and it turns out there's a big appetite for a Jennifer/Eric reconciliation.
Plus, we're...
Sort of in love again, kind of thanks to you.
(Eric sighs)
Well, I think it's great.
Eric:
You do?
Connor:
Absolutely!
I mean, look at you two!
Look at us!
I think we should celebrate.
Why don't we go for a drive up the coast?
I've always wanted to go to Salinas.
I don't know if you're hearing us right.
Um...
Since Eric and I are getting back together,
That would mean that you and I are no longer "dating,"
Yeah.
So... that would effectively end our contract.
Right.
Connor, are you okay, buddy?
Connor:
Well, I just...
I didn't see this coming.
I mean...
I fought for you two.
I fought for this,
I thought that we were getting along.
I thought you guys liked me.
We do like you, Connor.
Connor:
So what, now that you guys are back together and you got your Fincher film you're just happy to kick me out?
Just like that?
Eric:
Connor...

Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
(GUARD CLEARS THROAT)
No kissing.
(CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS) Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
(SIGHS)
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
ALL:
- Amen.
- Thank you.
JOEY:
Thank you, Father.
FATHER LEO:
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
(EXHALES)
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
(GUARD CLEARS THROAT)
ANGIE:
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
NICK:
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
(GRUNTS)
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
JOEY:
Get off me!
Get away!
GUARD:
All right.
Calm down.
Calm... (GROANS)
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
GUARD:
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
NICK:
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!

What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.

Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
MAN:
- Where?
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
(CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON MEGAPHONE)
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
TRAFFIC COP:
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
FIREMAN:
Call for the bag.
COP:
Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30$, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
MAN:
Don't do it, man!
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
MARCUS:
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
(MARCUS READING)
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(GROANS)
(EXHALES)
Shit.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yeah?
DOUGHERTY:
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
(HANGS UP)
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around Ready?
Is my hair okay?
CAMERAMAN:
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.

Good luck hitting this.

- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
MARCUS:
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
(SIGHS) Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
(CROWD SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
TOM:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
MONICA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
(INDISTINCT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER) Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
JOEY:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two... (ALL SHOUTING)
- One!
- Don't!
(CROWD YELLING)
(EXPLOSION)
MAN:
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(COUGHING)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
(BEEPING)
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
COP:
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)

We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
DOUGHERTY:
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
MORALES:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
TOM:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(CLANKING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
MAN 1:
Get on with it already!
MAN 2:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(SHUSHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
JOEY:
See?
ANGIE:
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
MARCUS:
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent".
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE RINGS)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
MAN 1:
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
WOMAN:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work, we go to war.
MAN 2:
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you, you take it back.
MEN:
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
MERCER:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL SHOUTING)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
(INDISTINCT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
SECURITY GUARD:
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
MARCUS:
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(SIREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(INDISTINCT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(SIREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
MAN:
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(SIGHS)
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Bon appétit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
DOUGHERTY:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(SIGHS)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
NICK:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you out the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
ANGIE:
- Done.
(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
NICK:
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
MERCER:
Okay, I'm coming over.
NICK:
Come on.
MERCER:
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
LUTZ:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
MARCUS:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
ANGIE:
It's gotta be here!
Right?
JOEY:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
JOEY:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
DOUGHERTY:
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
ACKERMAN:
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
NICK:
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
(YELLING)
No!
Oh, no!
(GRUNTS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
MORALES:
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
LUTZ:
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
DETECTIVE:
LOOK at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
(BEEPING)
(GUN COCKING)
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
(DOOR CLOSES)
- Nina!
Ackerman!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(SIGHS)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
COMMANDO:
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
COMMANDO:
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
JOEY:
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
NICK:
Just stay there!
COMMANDO:
Stay down!
(SCREAMS)
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
MAN:
Let me see!
I wanna see!
(WOMAN 1 SCREAMS) WOMAN 2:
- Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
(GRUNTING)
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
(GROANING)
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
(GROANING)
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
COMMANDO:
Hands in the air!
MERCER:
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
COMMANDO:
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
MERCER:
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
MARCUS:
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
MARCUS:
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
ANGIE:
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
NICK:
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
MARCUS:
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLING)
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
(CROWD SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
COP:
- There he is!
Let's go!
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
(YELLING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
MORALES:
Are you getting that?
NICK:
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
MAN:
He has the diamond!
NICK:
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
NICK:
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
DOUGHERTY:
Crazy day, huh?
(CHUCKLING)
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
(ALL CHEERING)
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
(ANGIE GASPS)
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
(ALL CHEERING)
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!

Subtitles by demonseye
Good morning, sir.
- The last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower...
Great view...
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit 'im!
That's right, take 'im down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I'm here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mm-hm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mm-hm.
Nick...
Have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mm-hm.
No.
But killing... every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
- It's been a while.
- Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike?
- Yeah.
I went shoppin'.
I'm about to be a married man, so, uh... gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
Ah, you know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean...
We dig up some new evidence.
I mean, there's things we can do.
You know?
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's, uh...
He's dyin'.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside o' here.
No hassles.
- Mm.
- All right?
Take care o' yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to... find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, father.
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, Cass...
I'm sorry, man.
- It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there.
Okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
I'll see...
I'll see you, babe.
Is this the best you could do, huh?
View of the goddamned tracks?
Man, you killed 'im the day you went to prison.
That's cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
All right.
Calm down.
Ahh!
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
On the belt.
Hurry!
- You better not come back here.
- Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
- Nobody move.
- Way to make dad proud!
This is 3-12.
Prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See 'im?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill 'im.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back off!
Back off!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty and I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
All right?
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck outta here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty.
Report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30's...
looks like a professional type...
- And he's not talkin'.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone in your staff that had any sort o' contact with him.
- Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
- Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
- Mr. Walker...
- I want a woman.
All right, well, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come on inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talkin', Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
Says if we don't get 'er, he's goin' off.
"Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
"I exit this world as I entered - innocent."
Yeah.
More likely he's goin' to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What, are you kiddin' me?
Seriously?
You'll back 'er up.
You're my guy.
Yeah, sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kiddin' me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel.
21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
Engine, start.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it, let's get it right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around, all right?
Ready?
- Is my hair okay?
- Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three... two... one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting' this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer...
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
- Kiss my ass, Jack.
- FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And... he's not talkin', other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get 'im.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- Nope.
- Drunk?
- Doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please, please, don't make me beg.
You got it.
But, uh... time is a-wastin'.
- You processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm detective Lydia Mercer and I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Hey, trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff, it's... it's no good.
Today is the day...
that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me...
that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month, you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I...
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.
My scene, my room.
Get out!
You heard 'er, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're gettin' a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
And my father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you wanna talk about it?
You know, this job o' yours, it's, uh...
It's a pretty grim way to make a livin'.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hopin' you're one of 'em.
Got a lot o' friends on the force?
Enough.
Bet you're not too popular with the, uh... boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Or anything at the border?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find 'im first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
Well, I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
Uh, David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Yeah, well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today, there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's... it's the... councilman.
It's too much of a risk if... they tie that money to me.
Look.
Uh...
I'll... talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David... please.
- What's this?
- I-it's a gift.
I...
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I...
when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now... that was a gift, huh?
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hm?
Tell me... it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a 100-dollar tip on a 240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah, huh.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- Yeah, my mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah.
Be my pleasure.
Hey, you want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's goin' on here.
But I can tell you that these people down here... they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick.
Can you hear me?
Is this thing workin' yet?
And I'm askin' you to help me understand what's goin' on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you because I needed someone I could count on.
A'ight?
Someone I could trust, cause chances are this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized
- What?
It's the news.
- for her questionable handling... of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well...
People love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Yeah.
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
So, why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doin' way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking' from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hopin' he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give 'im an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it 100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's lookin' at me.
They were... sayin' on the news you're headed for Canada.
Couldn't have gone better.
You could've pulled your punches a little.
Oh, yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
!
- Seven.
- You're doin' that now, huh?
- Six.
Five... four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you-you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides... you'd probably screw this up without me.
Hey, don't say that.
No one's screwin' this up.
I know, I know, I'm just saying.
I-I-I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint 'em.
- Hey, hey.
- Three...
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey!
Look at me!
- Two...
- Look at me.
Walker, look at me!
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
See, I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Hey, cops are, uh... superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight on a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell... if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- 5, 1, uh...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's goin' on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove 'im up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Frickin' economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
That a photo?
- Of your dad?
- Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothin' made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about 'im?
Where it's safer, you know?
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot here.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus, Marcus!
What's goin' on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamn air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure.
He has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
- who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
- Are you all right?
- You want me to trust you?
- Sorry, that wasn't ours!
- You're gonna have that?
I'm sorry!
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Gimme your hand.
Gimme your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinkin'?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not goin' over.
- Something's off.
- Yeah, that's what I'm thinkin'.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for somethin'.
- We need this ID.
- All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 storeys up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you, uh... told me what's really goin' on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
You know, to be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see, let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it, what is it?
That's a sensor.
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talkin' about, doesn't it?
Okay.
Joey...
In high school, I used to, uh, break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes.
You know?
Unless the clothes... fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you wanna tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right, do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doin'?
Ugh...
Nick, we got somethin' that I think isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I-I'd be... having dinner at Roberto's.
You tell me about it.
Babe, tell 'im what you're lookin' at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling, about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle o' wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
Uh, what are you sayin'?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing... that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweatin' down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just lookin' out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window...
and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
- But I don't think it's a good idea.
- You got someplace better to be?
Well, if I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The 40 million-dollar diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- Well, what did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent".
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just havin' an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doin'?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort o' game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Yeah.
Do you believe that?
Look.
He was my partner for five years.
So... do you think he would jump?
He's got nothin' to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
Well, I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I, uh, decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I... bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago...
when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes, sir!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
You know, I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another...
that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen...
we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
Cause I'm seriously starting' to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sendin' a team across the street right now.
Ho, ho, ho!
Hold on, hold on, hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
You having fun jerking me around?
- You tryin' to manipulate me?
- No!
Just...
Two years ago, I'm doin' a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
And yesterday, I'm doin' 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today, I'm puttin' it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
- You are nuts.
- You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Lookin' over your shoulder, and, uh, sleepin' with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching'.
Maybe you should tell me the rest o' your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and you tell your bosses that I'm not goin' back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
C'mon, c'mon.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
God, I love this guy!
Make way, make way!
Make way!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here, right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get-get-get-get-get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move, move!
Get out of here!
- How you doin', babe?
- It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Shit!
Go!
Go, go, go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- You been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's goin' is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamn embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're suckin' fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9... 6-7... pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors...
And over there... we got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
- It's all clear.
- Nobody's gettin' in that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling' up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, ain't it?
- Do your thing.
So, where we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
- Yeah?
What's that make 'im?
- An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm-a put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get 'im off the ledge?
- Yes.
- He likes me.
- Marcus.
Give 'er a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sendin' tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Move, move!
C'mon!
Ahh, shit!
C'mon!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
- Boyfriends?
- Uh-huh.
Girlfriends?
- Best sex of my life?
- Well...
Obviously.
Hey, okay, wait.
Hold-hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor...
Your family...
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
Look, after I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, like guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years bangin' my head against a brick wall, cause I know, I know, that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost 30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
No, he wouldn't do that.
Cause he wouldn't wanna be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent 'im a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
Come on, I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
Look, you know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any o' this...
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch 'im.
You're gettin' a little too comfortable barkin' orders.
- What's up?
- Hello.
- How's he doin'?
- Well, Mercer hasn't killed 'im yet.
Well, is he talkin'?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
- Take 'em up to Dougherty.
- Lemme see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie...
What?
You're movin' artwork, girl.
So, uh... what was the best sex o' your life, huh?
- Uh, you, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well... there's this one guy...
in high school...
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
And then when was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but... the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal somethin' twice, especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
- What if he didn't do it?
- Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're tryin' to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to somethin'.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine outta evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled outta the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he sayin'?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yep.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch....
Headset....
Headset.
Let's... go, go, go!
Piece o' cake, right?
- No.
- No?
- No, no.
- What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
!
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out o' here.
Did I stutter?
Yeah, you see that?
Huh, huh?
You see that?
Huh?
Is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
See that?
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to 'im.
- Yeah, uh...
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Was it a Joe Walker set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said "So what?".
You're not gettin' near 'im.
- That's my friend out there.
- And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
Well, you better know what the hell you're doin'.
And what's this?
I...
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How you doing, kid?
I'm hangin' in there.
Bon appetit.
How you doin' in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's tickin'.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering'.
Yeahh!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering' for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeahh!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Light as a feather.
- I heard that!
- Yeah, yeah...
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back to custody...
they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just...
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
Thought I had þim wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Gimme more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires... comin' out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a. uh...
a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Hey, babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
Done.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Good girl.
Okay.
Now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- You all right?
- Don't... talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
Time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
Bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
Goddamn it!
Dougherty, pull 'er out o' there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doin'?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment o' truth.
Let's see what we got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm comin' over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab 'er, too?
- What, are you kiddin' me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just, uh...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Whoa!
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kiddin' me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them outta here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, okay, listen.
Listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're-they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's comin' back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set o' balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
- Where are we with Internal Affairs?
- Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
Yeah.
This is detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm tellin' you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So, uh... you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Huh?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's goin' on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking' to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doin'?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
- I'm your friend!
- Then why you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take 'im down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone not in squad 13, teams o' two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sittin' behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- Oh, she speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table!
Thanks for takin' off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family?
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it, huh?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm gonna enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seein' you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
Uh, we'll be back in two days.
Could you, uh, hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
Goddamn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamn hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take 'im out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we've strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A, um, a Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's 'im!
Get outta the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, outta the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
You all right?
You all right?
Joey Cassidy?
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- You okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Stay down.
Hey, lemme see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same.
Blood, snot 'n tears.
Now, where's the rock, tough guy?
- You hit like a girl.
- Huh...
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- All right, all right, guys.
- Hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got 'im!
We got 'im!
We got 'im.
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it, we got it.
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- You hear what I said?
I said stand down!
- I'm not goin' anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take 'er down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22, all right?
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
- This is not gonna be okay.
- Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flyin'.
You earned what you got comin'.
But the kid?
I'll let 'im go.
- It's got nothin' to do with him!
- Where... is it?
- Throw 'im off!
- Hold on!
What are you doin'?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
You know, there's two kind of people in this world.
People who'll do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten... or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, you know, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
All right!
He 'ad nothing to do with it!
You leave 'im alone.
- Okay?
- Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece o' shit!
- Four!
- Let 'im go!
- Do it, jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
You okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were gonna set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick!
Nick, he's gettin' away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you gettin' that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond, man!
- I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back o' your head?
Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But, um...
I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Thanks.
Looks like the governor came through.
I'll let you two...
say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One comin' out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you outta here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go some place quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
Look, it's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
You know, I'm sick o' this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, uh... meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
- Alive and well.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shittin' me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez...
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
- Let me see it, let me see it.
Oh!
- Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom?
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
- All right.
Calm down.
- Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30$, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent".
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you out the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
LOOK at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.

- You are goddamn embarrassment.
You rep this up now, Or you'll be sucking fumes on a parking scooter.
In a stagnant island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina, Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander's detains it's high rollers.
Disarm the vault room.
The floor is wired with sizes of sensors.
Over there we got light sensors and body heat sensors.
And that's before you get to the vault.
- It's all clear.
- Nobody is going to get into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
- This is Nestor.
- Englander is clear detective.
Good.
At least the son of a bitch corner my ass anymore.
Roger that.
It's over.
Mercer.
What is that doing here?
- There's a fugitive situation.
Ain't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He's acting like he really believes he's innocent.
Yeah?
What does that make?
An honest man or sociopaths.
He ain't an honest man.
I'm going to put an end to this show up here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
- He likes me.
- Marcus.
- Marcus give her a little more time.
- You have 15 minutes.
Then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lads.
All right.
Let's go, "thief".
Are you sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Move come on!
Ahh shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell?
- You're trying to cheat me?
You don't want know everything.
- Nobody does.
- I'm sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
The best sex of my life?
Obviously.
Hey.
Okay.
Wait.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Step back.
The "Monarch" Diamond is most recently held by David Englander.
Until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy
The man on the ledge.
Who set off to untraceable pieces and sold it.
Time is running out here Nick.
Tactical is on scene.
And I'm tired of being played.
How far would you go?
To take down a man who stole everything from you?
Your Honor.
Your Family.
What would you do?
You do whatever it takes.
After I drove them to tropical
Guys in masked knocked me out and he just stood there smiling.
- But the jury didn't believe that Nick.
- And even did my lawyer.
And I already spent two years banging my head against the brick wall, because I know, that the "Monarch" never left his hands.
Why Englander to steal his own diamond?
He lost 30 million to Lehman.
And about 20 million in a real estate bust.
He was that close to being a bankrupt.
If he needed the cash he could have sold it.
No.
He won't do that.
Cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction, Louis of London sent me a check 40 million for claims.
And he's back.
Come one.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on.
- Who are the thugs?
I don't know.
But know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops.
You what it's like when they are doing back on you
When your hostage is gone
Today is the day that you are really gonna save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this.
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You got a little to comfortable to bark at us.
Wassup?
How he's doing?
Hasn't kill him yet.
What does he talking?
You know, Mikey ...
One day you you gonna stick your dick, in the wrong door, and someone's gonna slam it.
I got some paper in his cell in Sing Sing.
- Take it up to Daugherty.
- Let me see them.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie ...
What?
You are a living work of art.
Damn.
So.
What the best sex of your life?
No doubt, with you Joey.
- Yes?
- Now ...
There's this one guy in high school ...
He's older He had his hands.
Don even mess with me.
Let's go.
- And when was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did they have anything?
- Everyone expect the diamond
- The the case goes apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
- Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing is happening.
Across the street?
He can't steal something twice, especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
- What if he didn't do it?
- Please, Mercer.
Marcus?
Go.
What if there's were other cops involved in the Englander case?
If you try to get yourself even more despise in the department, I'll say you are into something.
I just found out that Cassidy was co-operating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappears about a million bucks worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave them a name Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
A week after Cassidy went up.
Walker and his car got pulled up of the hut.
Yeah yeah, alcohol level was point 2.3.
Can you stop while you're behind.
Who ever was in it with Walker.
Had every reasons to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegations.
I know Cassidy is not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What he's saying?
Fuck you.
- Lads, get your people into positions.
- Now!
- Roger that.
It's game time gentlemen.
- Strapped them?
- Yep.
Let's
Go, Go, Go.
Piece of cake right?
No.
No.
- No?
- No
- Why not?
- I don't think i'll fit in there.
Hey listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like what we practiced.
Or Nick would kill me
Nick will kill you?
- I am going to kill you.
- Be mad just be mad at the vent.
Get out of here.
Yes?
Done.
Yes huh.
Now you see that?
Now you see that?
This occurs when driven to madness.
This what happens when we push too far.
There's no rich guy in prison.
Nick Cassidy, Would be any of us.
Nick Cassidy has always maintains he's innocent.
Do you actually believes he stole the "Monarch" Diamond?
I hope he had done it.
Who wouldn't?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Daugherty.
Welcome to the party.
- Brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Thank you.
Hey.
I'm Lydia Mercer.
- I want to talk to him.
- Yes ...
Do you work for Englander or was it just Nick?
I do not know what you're talking about.
Was it Joe Walker set that details up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "so what?".
You are not getting near.
- There's my friend out there.
-And this is my scene.
Daugherty would you talk to her.
Look man that's the lady's call.
We'll will call you if we need you.
- Thank you.
- I hope you better know what the hell you're doing.
- What's this?
- I brought up some food.
I think the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing kid?
Hang in there.
Bon appetite.
How are you doing there babe?
- I can't do it.
- What?
Babe, the clock is ticking.
We don't have enough time.
Come on.
Do not panic.
Angie.
It's a sunny day.
Crowd's cheering.
Yes.
"Jump into my arms" "We're with you"
Listen to that they are all cheering for you.
They are on our side.
Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
All right.
Just relax.
Focus.
You must do this thing fast before the heat sensor caught up with you.
"Light" as a "flake"
I heard that.
Yes, yes.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
Can't yet.
The whole world knows you are now, Nick.
You inspired every reporters to look into your story.
If you're innocent it will come out.
I'm not going back to custody.
They're going to kill me.
Nick.
Do leave me hanging out here.
Look.
Just I need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
That I have him wired.
I'm supposed to be relieved.
But I stay down because I knew.
Only then,
Suddenly I didn't know.
It's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey Mercer.
You want to take a look at these.
He had bomb kinetics in his cell.
Angie, You're with me.
Tell me what you see.
I see a mass of wires.
Coming out of a circuit.
All right.
Now, Find the main processor.
Like a big hole around it.
- You found it?
- Yes.
- I got it.
- Okay.
As you have practiced, we got to sort it out to take out the sensors.
First cut the red wire.
The red wire?
There are all red wire.
Nick, it's because of the light.
Maybe pick the reddish one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it Nick.
Shut up and listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one.
Hell is going to break loose.
Done.
Good girl.
Okay,
Now touch the wire to the processor.
All right.
It is much easier.
Can make a small spark.
Angie.
Angie?
Angie?
Angie, You hear me?
- You all right?
- Don't talk to me right now.
- Okay?
I can now confirm that the Bomb Squad has just arrived on the scene and
Tactical units are on their way up to the roof on Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is that a bomb?
You ask for my trust and then this?
This is the moment you make your choice remember?
Mercer.
Tactical a go.
Time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stay down Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.

What if I find Walker case?
Doesn't matter.
There's nothing in it.

Let's go to some place quiet.
That's right Dann.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
We experienced both good.
We are well known.
Hey bartender.
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
I'm afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Hahaha.
Lydia?
Meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.

- No kidding?
They are your sons.

Nick.

Angela Maria Lopez.

I'm going to assume that's a family errand?
It is now.
Drinks all around.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!

- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!

All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.

Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.

He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.

Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.

Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.

You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.

You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.

Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30$, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent".
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you out the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
LOOK at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Pkay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Ph, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
All right.
Calm down.
Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- Pn the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Ph, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Pkay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Pf course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Ph, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Ph, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
Pne minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
Pne way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Ph, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Pf course.
- Thanks.
Pkay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Ph.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized
- for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Pbviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Pvernight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Ph, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- Pne!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Pf your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
- who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get offthe pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Pkay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Pkay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Ph!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on yourjumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Ph, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Pkay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Put of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Pbviously.
Pkay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Ph, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
Pne day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
Ifyou're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of.23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Pkay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
Pn the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Pnly then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Pkay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Pkay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Pkay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Pkay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Ph, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
Pne thing.
- Pkay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Ph, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Ph, shit.
Pkay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Pkay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Pkay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Ppen the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Ph, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Pkay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Pf course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Pkay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Pkay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Ph, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Pkay!
Pkay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Pkay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Pfficer down!
Pfficer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Pfficer down!
Pfficer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Pr back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back ofyour head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
Pne coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!

That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
-Hurting?
-Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.

Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.

Take care of yourself.
Yep.

And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.

Yeah, looks like it.

Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
MAN 2:
All right, got it.
(INDISTINCT)
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
MAN:
Don't shove me, man.
COP 1:
Hey!
Back up!
MAN:
I got a right to walk where I want.
COP 2:
All sealed off.
(SIGHING) Shit.
Mercer.
-You good to work?
-Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
MARCUS:
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
-Go get him.
-Two minutes.
-He ask for help?
-No.
-Drunk?
-He doesn't appear to be.
-Wedding ring?
-Nope.
-Demands?
-Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
(SIGHS) Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
-Have you processed these yet?
-Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
(CROWD SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Four!
Three!
-Two!
-Mr.
Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with ajumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
ls that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
TOM:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
-Anything at JFK?
-No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
-Tom, listen.
-Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, GUYS
I'll tell you what, Monica.
MONICA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
-Yeah.
Of course.
-Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
-What's this?
-It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
-You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
-My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
(INDISTINCT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
-Mr.
Walker...
-What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump That's why they're here.
But I do care.
JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER) Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy All right?
To jump or not to jump.
-This is gonna come down to your choice.
-I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
-Are you kidding me with this?
-As you may recall, she was widely criticized
-for her questionable handling...
-What?
It's the news.
...ofIast month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
-One has to wonder about her suitability...
-I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(slel-lS)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's ajumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
-Everything's in place.
-Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
-No!
-I give him an hour.
-I'll take the under.
-Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
JOEY:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
-Really?
-Eight.
-What?
-Seven.
-You're doing that now?
-Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
-Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
-No.
-You don't have to do this.
-Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
-Yeah.
-But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
-Ready?
-Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
-Hey, what are you doing?
No!
-Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
-Walker!
Look at me!
-Two... (ALL SHOUTING)
-One!
-Don't!
(CROWD YELLING)
(EXPLOSION)
MAN:
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(COUGHING)
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
ls there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
-Five, one...
-5-1-6, double 2, star.
(BEEPING)
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
-What's going on?
-COP:
Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
-Where is it?
-The Roosevelt.
ls that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
-Just the two of us.
-No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
MAN:
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
DOUGHERTY:
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
-Clear the goddamned air space!
-Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
MORALES:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
-who may be able to shed some light...
-Yeah, Tom, what you got?
TOM:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
-That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
-You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(CLANKING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
-Jumpers jump, right?
-Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
-Something's off.
-That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
-Go on!
-ls he gonnajump?
-Go on!
-Jump!
.Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
-Jump!
-Jump!
Jump!
-Yeah,jump!
MAN 1:
Get on with it already!
MAN 2:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
-Okay.
We're clear.
-Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(SHUSHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
-You're so stupid.
-(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
-Do you see it?
-No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
-Let me see.
-Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
JOEY:
See?
ANGIE:
Back up.
-Back up, back up, back up.
-What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey-
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
-You broke...
-Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
ls there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
Ifyou could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
-Bottle of wine...
-That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
ls she hot?
-Oh!
-It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
-Cool it down.
-Yeah.
-Cool it down.
-Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right.
that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
-MARCUS:
Listen up.
-Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on yourjumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
-What the hell is going on?
-What did his little note say?
-"| will exit as I entered..." -"Innocent."
-He wants people to think he didn't do it.
-Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE RINGS)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Eng|ander's shop.
-Detective...
-Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
-Remember?
-MAN 1:
Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
WOMAN:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
-we go to war.
-MAN 2:
Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
-you take it back.
-MEN:
Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my newjewel, the Monarch Spire!
-Cheers!
-Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've lD'd the jumper.
-So what?
-It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
MERCER:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You cou|d've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL SHOUTING)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
-Watch your backs.
-Stay back!
Stay back!
(INDISTINCT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
-That's the entrance.
-Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
-I can't get it.
It won't stay!
-Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
-Under control?
-Yeah.
-Have you been outside?
-Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
-Whoa!
-And that's before you even get to the vault.
SECURITY GUARD:
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
-Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Eng|ander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- MARCUS:
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(SIREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
-Nothing you wanna tell me?
-You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(INDISTINCT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
-It's a circus.
-I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactica|'s on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he c:ould've just sold it
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
-Come on!
-Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(SIREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
ls he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
-I'll take these up.
-You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
-You, Joey.
-Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
-MAN:
A week after the heist.
-Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
-That's great.
-That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(slel-lS)
-Marcus?
-Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
-Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
-Yes.
-Pouch and headset, please.
-Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, Q0, 9°
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
-No.
-No?
What do you mean, no?
-I don't think I'll fit in there.
-Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it Who wouldn't have?
-Mike Ackerman.
-Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
-I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
-Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
-So what?
-So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Bon appétit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the c|ock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
DOUGHERTY:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(slel-lS)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
-I got it.
-Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
-Hold on.
-She can do it, Nick.
NICK:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
-ANGIE:
Done.
-(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
-NICK:
It might spark a bit.
-Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
-Are you all right?
-Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
ls there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactica|'s a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, cause you re in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
-Mercer, get back in here!
-Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
MERCER:
Okay, I'm coming over.
NICK:
Come on.
MERCER:
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
LUTZ:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
MARCUS:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
ANGIE:
It's gotta be here!
Right?
JOEY:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
-Hell, no.
-No?
JOEY:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
-Just...
-What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
-Say again?
-I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Eng|ander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
-Find them!
-I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
-Get your people set.
-All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonnajump or what?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
DOUGHERTY:
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
-I can't do that.
-Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
-Involved in what?
-There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
-ACKERMAN:
I'm your friend.
-Jesus Christ.
-NICK:
Getaway from me!
-Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
(YELLING)
No!
Oh, no!
(GRUNTS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
-Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
-Come on.
They can't stop us!
-Get out of my way!
-MORALES:
Come with me.
Come with me.
-Come on, somebody!
-Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
-Sir!
Sir!
-You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- LUTZ:
Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
DETECTIVE:
Look at this.
-What?
-Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
(BEEPING)
(sun COCKING)
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
-Who are you?
-You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
-She speaks, too.
-Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
-(DOOR CLOSES)
-Nina!
Ackerman!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
-Of course, sir.
-Name's Cassidy.
-You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
-Thank you.
-You folks have a great day.
-You, too.
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
-Yeah.
Go.
-Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(slel-lS)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
COMMANDO:
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
COMMANDO:
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
JOEY:
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
NICK:
Just stay there!
COMMANDO:
Stay down!
(SCREAMS)
Get down!
-Are you okay?
-Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
MAN:
Let me see!
I wanna see!
-(WOMAN 1 SCREAMS)
-WOMAN 2:
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
(GRUNTING)
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
(GROANING)
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
(GROANING)
Okay!
Okay!
-He's not armed!
-I'm not armed!
COMMANDO:
Hands in the air!
MERCER:
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
-Get down on your knees!
-Hey, easy!
-Nick, get down.
-COMMANDO:
But keep your hands in the air!
-Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
-Down on your knees.
-MERCER:
We got him!
We got him!
-Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
-Get your hands up!
-Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
-It's under control!
-Mercer!
Stand down.
-It's under control, Marcus.
-I said stand down!
-I'm not going anywhere!
-MARCUS:
That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
-You gonna arrest me?
-Take her down to command.
-Get off me.
-MARCUS:
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
-We're clear.
-ANGIE:
No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
-I love you.
-It's gonna be okay, baby.
-I love you.
I love you.
-No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
-It's got nothing to do with him!
-Where is it?
-Throw him off!
-NICK:
Hold on!
What are you doing?
-Don't do it, Nick!
-Shut up!
-Don't do it!
-MARCUS:
Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
-Four!
-Let him go!
-Jump!
-I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLING)
Goon.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
-Nick!
-No!
(CROWD SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
-David!
-COP:
There he is!
Let's go!
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
(YELLING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
MORALES:
Are you getting that?
NICK:
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
MAN:
He has the diamond!
NICK:
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
Cause I m not through with you, pal.
NICK:
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
DOUGHERTY:
Crazy day, huh?
(CHUCKLING)
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
-You okay?
-Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
-Spill it.
-What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
(ALL CHEERING)
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
-Girlfriend.
-Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
(ANGIE GASPS)
Will you marry me?
-Hell, yes.
-Yeah?
(ALL CHEERING)
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
-Do you like it?
-Yeah!

Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
Where?
Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
Amen.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Father.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
All right.
Calm down.
Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
See him?
I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
ACKERMANI What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
Call for the bag.
Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then Ijump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel.
21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
Don't shove me, man.
Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Fouﬂ
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys-
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized
- for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
-5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
- who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
_Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
Get on with it already!
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered... " J1nn0cent"
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you. "
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, 90, 99
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you out the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
Okay, I'm coming over.
Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
You want us to try and grab her, too?
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
It's gotta be here!
Right?
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- heh,no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
LOOK at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
Just stay there!
Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
Hands in the air!
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No,no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
He has the diamond!
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Sa turda y, Sun day
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Sa turda y, Sun day
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Sa turda y, Sun day
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Sa turda y, Sun day
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side...
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
All right.
Calm down.
Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- MAN:
Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff... that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
Alright, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
Pne minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
Pne way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, alright.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed 'till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
Not today there isn't.
I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
It is the most important meal of the day.
- Mh-hm.
- Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned... that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
Are you kidding me with this?
As you may recall, she was widely criticized...
- for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
One has to wonder...
- about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Pbviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Pvernight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist...
- who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on yourjumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered"...
- "Innocent".
He wants people to think he didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious... when I, uh... decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending... a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Put of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
Whoa!
And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Pbviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander... until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
If he needed cash,
- he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick... in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
Ifyou're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of 23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you".
Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appetit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
Pn the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
You want us to try and grab her, too?
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
Involved in what?
There's someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name they're gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- 'MARCUS]:
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What're you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back ofyour head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
Pne coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
- All right.
Calm down.
- Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30$, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent".
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you out the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
LOOK at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!

On a hostage negotiation.
He gets everyone out.
He trusted your instincts.
He never quit.
He never gave up.
How do you know so much about me?
Cause you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you want to jump.
Is there a moment when you think to.
Someone gonna go off or not?
Sometimes I know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don give up on me.
I can get you off the ledge.

Before you get into trouble.
But Nicky, numbnuts This is not candle light dinner.

The Cop who stole the Diamond off David Englander?
40 million dollar diamonds.
I knew I recognise this man.
David Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry exchange is right across the street.
What the hell is going on?
What in his little note say?
"I leave this world ..." when we entered.
"I WILL EXIT AS I ENTERED" "INNOCENT"
He wants people to think he didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who did he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How he's doing?
Well he's playing us very cool like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look.
He is my partner for 5 years.
So ...
Do you think he would jump?
He got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
Security services.
This is nestor.
Hello Nestor, this Detective Marcus.
Over the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up angle the shop.

Hello everybody.
I'm glad that you can make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Work his ass of this jewelery trade.
So, he was more than a little anxious, When I uh,
Decided to risk it all on a real estate.
That's why I bought the "Monarch" diamonds.
The one I could to honor him.
You know, Three years ago,
When the market sank,
They said we were finished.
Remember?
But that what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough,
You can make it back.
In this city ...
On this island, we don't go to work.
We go to war.
And if somebody takes something from you,
You take it back.
And more.
You know I had one precious jewel taken away from me few years ago.
But now i've got another.
And no one will ever steal it from me.
Ladies and gentlemen ...
We're finally here.
To my new jewel, the "Monarch Spire".
Congratulations David you pull it off.

That's isn't freedom.
Standing here in font of all this Tv cam is?

We gotta go.
Joey, talk to me.
Angie.
Damn.
Go, go, go.
Disarm 15th lobby.
Hallway sensors.
What is this son of a bitch.
Doing on my building?
I do not know Mr. Englander.
But I can assure you that the situation is completely under control.
- Under Control?
You've been outside?
- Yeah?
It is not accidental that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy is going, Is back into the custody.
- It's over before you know it.
- You are goddamn embarrassment.
You rep this up now, Or you'll be sucking fumes on a parking scooter.
In a stagnant island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina, Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander's detains it's high rollers.
Disarm the vault room.
The floor is wired with sizes of sensors.
Over there we got light sensors and body heat sensors.
And that's before you get to the vault.
- It's all clear.
- Nobody is going to get into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
- This is Nestor.
- Englander is clear detective.
Good.
At least the son of a bitch corner my ass anymore.
Roger that.
It's over.
Mercer.
What is that doing here?
- There's a fugitive situation.
Ain't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He's acting like he really believes he's innocent.
Yeah?
What does that make?
An honest man or sociopaths.
He ain't an honest man.
I'm going to put an end to this show up here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
- He likes me.
- Marcus.
- Marcus give her a little more time.
- You have 15 minutes.
Then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lads.
All right.
Let's go, "thief".
Are you sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Move come on!
Ahh shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell?
- You're trying to cheat me?
You don't want know everything.
- Nobody does.
- I'm sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
The best sex of my life?
Obviously.
Hey.
Okay.
Wait.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Step back.
The "Monarch" Diamond is most recently held by David Englander.
Until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy
The man on the ledge.
Who set off to untraceable pieces and sold it.
Time is running out here Nick.
Tactical is on scene.
And I'm tired of being played.
How far would you go?
To take down a man who stole everything from you?
Your Honor.
Your Family.
What would you do?
You do whatever it takes.
After I drove them to tropical
Guys in masked knocked me out and he just stood there smiling.
- But the jury didn't believe that Nick.
- And even did my lawyer.
And I already spent two years banging my head against the brick wall, because I know, that the "Monarch" never left his hands.
Why Englander to steal his own diamond?
He lost 30 million to Lehman.
And about 20 million in a real estate bust.
He was that close to being a bankrupt.
If he needed the cash he could have sold it.
No.
He won't do that.
Cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction, Louis of London sent me a check 40 million for claims.
And he's back.
Come one.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on.
- Who are the thugs?
I don't know.
But know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops.
You what it's like when they are doing back on you
When your hostage is gone
Today is the day that you are really gonna save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this.
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You got a little to comfortable to bark at us.
Wassup?
How he's doing?
Hasn't kill him yet.
What does he talking?
You know, Mikey ...
One day you you gonna stick your dick, in the wrong door, and someone's gonna slam it.
I got some paper in his cell in Sing Sing.
- Take it up to Daugherty.
- Let me see them.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie ...
What?
You are a living work of art.
Damn.
So.
What the best sex of your life?
No doubt, with you Joey.
- Yes?
- Now ...
There's this one guy in high school ...
He's older He had his hands.
Don even mess with me.
Let's go.
- And when was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did they have anything?
- Everyone expect the diamond
- The the case goes apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
- Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing is happening.
Across the street?
He can't steal something twice, especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
- What if he didn't do it?
- Please, Mercer.
Marcus?
Go.
What if there's were other cops involved in the Englander case?
If you try to get yourself even more despise in the department, I'll say you are into something.
I just found out that Cassidy was co-operating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappears about a million bucks worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave them a name Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
A week after Cassidy went up.
Walker and his car got pulled up of the hut.
Yeah yeah, alcohol level was point 2.3.
Can you stop while you're behind.
Who ever was in it with Walker.
Had every reasons to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegations.
I know Cassidy is not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What he's saying?
Fuck you.
- Lads, get your people into positions.
- Now!
- Roger that.
It's game time gentlemen.
- Strapped them?
- Yep.
Let's
Go, Go, Go.
Piece of cake right?
No.
No.
- No?
- No
- Why not?
- I don't think i'll fit in there.
Hey listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like what we practiced.
Or Nick would kill me
Nick will kill you?
- I am going to kill you.
- Be mad just be mad at the vent.
Get out of here.
Yes?
Done.
Yes huh.
Now you see that?
Now you see that?
This occurs when driven to madness.
This what happens when we push too far.
There's no rich guy in prison.
Nick Cassidy, Would be any of us.
Nick Cassidy has always maintains he's innocent.
Do you actually believes he stole the "Monarch" Diamond?
I hope he had done it.
Who wouldn't?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Daugherty.
Welcome to the party.
- Brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Thank you.
Hey.
I'm Lydia Mercer.
- I want to talk to him.
- Yes ...
Do you work for Englander or was it just Nick?
I do not know what you're talking about.
Was it Joe Walker set that details up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "so what?".
You are not getting near.
- There's my friend out there.
- And this is my scene.
Daugherty would you talk to her.
Look man that's the lady's call.
We'll will call you if we need you.
- Thank you.
- I hope you better know what the hell you're doing.
- What's this?
- I brought up some food.
I think the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing kid?
Hang in there.
Bon appetite.
How are you doing there babe?
- I can't do it.
- What?
Babe, the clock is ticking.
We don't have enough time.
Come on.
Do not panic.
Angie.
It's a sunny day.
Crowd's cheering.
Yes.
"Jump into my arms" "We're with you"
Listen to that they are all cheering for you.
They are on our side.
Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
All right.
Just relax.
Focus.
You must do this thing fast before the heat sensor caught up with you.
"Light" as a "flake"
I heard that.
Yes, yes.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
Can't yet.
The whole world knows you are now, Nick.
You inspired every reporters to look into your story.
If you're innocent it will come out.
I'm not going back to custody.
They're going to kill me.
Nick.
Do leave me hanging out here.
Look.
Just I need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
That I have him wired.
I'm supposed to be relieved.
But I stay down because I knew.
Only then,
Suddenly I didn't know.
It's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey Mercer.
You want to take a look at these.
He had bomb kinetics in his cell.
Angie, You're with me.
Tell me what you see.
I see a mass of wires.
Coming out of a circuit.
All right.
Now, Find the main processor.
Like a big hole around it.
- You found it?
- Yes.
- I got it.
- Okay.
As you have practiced, we got to sort it out to take out the sensors.
First cut the red wire.
The red wire?
There are all red wire.
Nick, it's because of the light.
Maybe pick the reddish one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it Nick.
Shut up and listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one.
Hell is going to break loose.
Done.
Good girl.
Okay,
Now touch the wire to the processor.
All right.
It is much easier.
Can make a small spark.
Angie.
Angie?
Angie?
Angie, You hear me?
- You all right?
- Don't talk to me right now.
- Okay?
I can now confirm that the Bomb Squad has just arrived on the scene and
Tactical units are on their way up to the roof on Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is that a bomb?
You ask for my trust and then this?
This is the moment you make your choice remember?
Mercer.
Tactical a go.
Time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stay down Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.

What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
Ijust wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
-Clear the room.
-I'm not going any here.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'Il give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
TOM:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
-Anything at JFK?
-No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.

Iwant you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
A11 right.
Iwant to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'Il tell you what, Monica.
MONICA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) Uh-huh. /'m listening.
L'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don 't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
-Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
-Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream. /knew I could count on you.
-Yeah.
Of course.
-Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
-Not today there isn't.
-I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'II talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
-What's this?
-It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
-It is the most important meal of the day.
-Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
-You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
-My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?

Yeah, be my pleasure.
(lNDlsTINcT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
-Mr.
Walker...
-What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER) Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, We're here, We're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
-This is gonna come down to your choice.
-I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, Iet's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating of?
cer is Lydia Mercen
-Are you kidding me with this?
-As you may recall, she was widely criticized
-for her questionable handling...
-What?
It's the news.
...of last month 's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young of?
cerlost his life.
-One has to wonder about her suitability...
-I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(sighs)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time looks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
-E verything's in place.
-Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping hejumps in time for the morning shows?
-No!
-I give him an hour.
-I'll take the under.
-Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
JOEY:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
-Reauy?
-Eight.
-What?
-Seven.
-You're doing that now?
-Six.
Five, four...
The night looks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
-Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
-No.
-You don't have to do this.
-Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
-Yeah.
-But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
-Ready?
-Huh?
-Ready?
-Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
-Hey, what are you doing?
No!
-Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
-Walker!
Look at me!
-Two... (ALL shouting)
-One!
-Don't!
(CROWD YELUNG)
(explosion)
MAN:
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(coughing)
-You all right?
-Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge_
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We 're in, buddy.
-Five, one...
-5-1-6, double 2, star.
(BEEPING)
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
-What's going on?
-COP:
Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
-Where is it?
-The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
-Just the two of us.
-No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
MAN:
We 're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
DOUGHERTY:
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
-Clear the goddamned air space!
-Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
MORALES:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there 's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
-who may be able to shed some light...
-Yeah, Tom, what you got?
TOM:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
-That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
-You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(cLANKING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
-You all right?
-Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
-Jumpers jump, right?
-Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
-Something's off.
-That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'Il see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a /edge 20 stories up and the unidenti?
ed man...
-Go on!
-Is he gonnajump?
-Go on!
-Jump!
-Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
-Jump!
-Jump!
Jump!
-Yeah, jump!
MAN 1:
Get on with it already!
MAN 2:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
-Okay.
We're clear.
-Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(sHUsHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
-You're so stupid.
-(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
-Do you see it?
-No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
-Let me see.
-Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
JOEY:
See?
ANGIE:
Back up.
-Back up, back up, back up.
-What is it?
That's a sensor.
-How do you know?
-I know.
Ijust know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
-You broke.._
-Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch_ All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, /need you, man.
We 've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles_
-Bottle of wine...
-That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
-Oh!
-It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
-Cool it down.
-Yeah.
-Cool it down.
-Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'Il let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting_
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
-MARCUS:
Listen up.
-Go.
Mercen I got an ID on your jumpen He 's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
-What the hell is going on?
-What did his little note say?
-"I will exit as I entered_.." Jïnnocent"
-He wants people to think he didn't do it.
-Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE rings)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
-Detective. ._
-Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
-Remember?
-MAN 1:
Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
WOMAN:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
-we go to war.
-MAN 2:
Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
-you take it back.
-MEN:
Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my newjewel, the Monarch Spire!
-Cheers!
-Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
-So what?
-It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
MERCER:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL shouting)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'Il go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
-Watch your backs.
-Stay back!
Stay back!
(lNDlsTINcT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD cLAlvloRING)
-That's the entrance.
-Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
-I can't get it.
It won't stay!
-Get the gear!
Get the gear.
-Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
-Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
-Under control?
-Yeah.
-Have you been outside?
-Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment_
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound_
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are Wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
-Whoa!
-And that's before you even get to the vault.
SECURITY GUARDZ lt'S all Clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
-Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don 't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
MGTCGT.
Why is tactical here?
-It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
-MARCUS:
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
AH h0l'1eSÎ ma?
OT 8 SOCÎOpaÎh.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
-Can you get him off the ledge?
-Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(slREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
-Nothing you wanna tell me?
-You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(lNDlsTINcT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
-It's a circus.
-I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
-The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
-That's right.
And neither did my lavvyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt_
-If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
-No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
-Come on!
-Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Pl€ase.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(slREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
-I'll take these up.
-You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
-You, Joey.
-Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
-MAN:
A week after the heist.
-Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
-That's great.
-That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(sighs)
-Marcus?
-Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I 'd say you're really on to something.
Ijust found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don 't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
-Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
-Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
-Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
-Yes.
-Pouch and headset, please.
-Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
-No.
-No?
What do you mean, no?
-I don't think I'II fit in there.
-Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn 't have?
-Mike Ackerman.
-Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
-I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
-Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
-I wanna talk to him.
-Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was itjust Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
-So what?
-So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD cLAlvloRING)
Bon appétit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering_
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'Il come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
Ijust need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him Wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
DOUGHERTY:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(sighs)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
Lt'll look like a big IOW building.
-You got it?
-Got it.
-I got it.
-Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
-Hold on.
-She can do it, Nick.
NICK:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
-ANGIE:
Done.
-(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
-NICK:
It might spark a bit.
-Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
-Are you all right?
-Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now con?
rm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do yourjob!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
-Mercer, get back in here!
-Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
-I am so hot for you right now.
-Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
MERCER:
Okay, I'm coming over.
NICK:
Come on.
MERCERZ Holy Shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
LUTZ:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
MARCUS:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
ANGIE:
It's gotta be here!
Right?
JOEY:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
-heh,no.
-No?
JOEY:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
-J ust. ._
-What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
-Say again?
-I'm sony bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.

Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid_
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.

-Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(sighs)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.

He never gave up.
How do you know so much about me?
Cause you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you want to jump.
Is there a moment when you think to.
Someone gonna go off or not?
Sometimes I know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don give up on me.
I can get you off the ledge.

The Cop who stole the Diamond off David Englander?
40 million dollar diamonds.
I knew I recognise this man.
David Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry exchange is right across the street.
What the hell is going on?
What in his little note say?
"I leave this world ..." when we entered.
"I WILL EXIT AS I ENTERED" "INNOCENT"
He wants people to think he didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who did he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How he's doing?
Well he's playing us very cool like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look.
He is my partner for 5 years.
So ...
Do you think he would jump?
He got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
Security services.
This is nestor.

I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Work his ass of this jewelery trade.
So, he was more than a little anxious, When I uh,
Decided to risk it all on a real estate.
That's why I bought the "Monarch" diamonds.
The one I could to honor him.
You know, Three years ago,
When the market sank,
They said we were finished.
Remember?
But that what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough,
You can make it back.
In this city ...
On this island, we don't go to work.
We go to war.
And if somebody takes something from you,
You take it back.
And more.
You know I had one precious jewel taken away from me few years ago.
But now i've got another.
And no one will ever steal it from me.
Ladies and gentlemen ...
We're finally here.
To my new jewel, the "Monarch Spire".

Angie.

Go, go, go.
Disarm 15th lobby.
Hallway sensors.
What is this son of a bitch.
Doing on my building?
I do not know Mr. Englander.
But I can assure you that the situation is completely under control.
- Under Control?
You've been outside?
- Yeah?
It is not accidental that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy is going, Is back into the custody.
- It's over before you know it.
- You are goddamn embarrassment.
You rep this up now, Or you'll be sucking fumes on a parking scooter.
In a stagnant island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina, Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander's detains it's high rollers.
Disarm the vault room.
The floor is wired with sizes of sensors.
Over there we got light sensors and body heat sensors.
And that's before you get to the vault.
- It's all clear.
- Nobody is going to get into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
- This is Nestor.
- Englander is clear detective.
Good.
At least the son of a bitch corner my ass anymore.
Roger that.
It's over.
Mercer.
What is that doing here?
- There's a fugitive situation.
Ain't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He's acting like he really believes he's innocent.
Yeah?
What does that make?
An honest man or sociopaths.
He ain't an honest man.
I'm going to put an end to this show up here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
- He likes me.
- Marcus.
- Marcus give her a little more time.
- You have 15 minutes.
Then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lads.
All right.
Let's go, "thief".
Are you sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Move come on!
Ahh shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell?
- You're trying to cheat me?
You don't want know everything.
- Nobody does.
- I'm sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
The best sex of my life?
Obviously.
Hey.
Okay.
Wait.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Step back.
The "Monarch" Diamond is most recently held by David Englander.
Until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy
The man on the ledge.
Who set off to untraceable pieces and sold it.
Time is running out here Nick.
Tactical is on scene.
And I'm tired of being played.
How far would you go?
To take down a man who stole everything from you?
Your Honor.
Your Family.
What would you do?
You do whatever it takes.
After I drove them to tropical
Guys in masked knocked me out and he just stood there smiling.
- But the jury didn't believe that Nick.
- And even did my lawyer.
And I already spent two years banging my head against the brick wall, because I know, that the "Monarch" never left his hands.
Why Englander to steal his own diamond?
He lost 30 million to Lehman.
And about 20 million in a real estate bust.
He was that close to being a bankrupt.
If he needed the cash he could have sold it.
No.
He won't do that.
Cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction, Louis of London sent me a check 40 million for claims.
And he's back.
Come one.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on.
- Who are the thugs?
I don't know.
But know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops.
You what it's like when they are doing back on you
When your hostage is gone
Today is the day that you are really gonna save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this.
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You got a little to comfortable to bark at us.
Wassup?
How he's doing?
Hasn't kill him yet.
What does he talking?
You know, Mikey ...
One day you you gonna stick your dick, in the wrong door, and someone's gonna slam it.
I got some paper in his cell in Sing Sing.
- Take it up to Daugherty.
- Let me see them.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie ...
What?
You are a living work of art.
Damn.
So.
What the best sex of your life?
No doubt, with you Joey.
- Yes?
- Now ...
There's this one guy in high school ...
He's older He had his hands.
Don even mess with me.
Let's go.
- And when was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did they have anything?
- Everyone expect the diamond
- The the case goes apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
- Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing is happening.
Across the street?
He can't steal something twice, especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
- What if he didn't do it?
- Please, Mercer.
Marcus?
Go.
What if there's were other cops involved in the Englander case?
If you try to get yourself even more despise in the department, I'll say you are into something.
I just found out that Cassidy was co-operating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappears about a million bucks worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave them a name Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
A week after Cassidy went up.
Walker and his car got pulled up of the hut.
Yeah yeah, alcohol level was point 2.3.
Can you stop while you're behind.
Who ever was in it with Walker.
Had every reasons to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegations.
I know Cassidy is not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What he's saying?
Fuck you.
- Lads, get your people into positions.
- Now!
- Roger that.
It's game time gentlemen.
- Strapped them?
- Yep.
Let's
Go, Go, Go.
Piece of cake right?
No.
No.
- No?
- No
- Why not?
- I don't think i'll fit in there.
Hey listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like what we practiced.
Or Nick would kill me
Nick will kill you?
- I am going to kill you.
- Be mad just be mad at the vent.
Get out of here.
Yes?
Done.
Yes huh.
Now you see that?
Now you see that?
This occurs when driven to madness.
This what happens when we push too far.
There's no rich guy in prison.
Nick Cassidy, Would be any of us.
Nick Cassidy has always maintains he's innocent.
Do you actually believes he stole the "Monarch" Diamond?
I hope he had done it.
Who wouldn't?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Daugherty.
Welcome to the party.
- Brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Thank you.
Hey.
I'm Lydia Mercer.
- I want to talk to him.

Do you work for Englander or was it just Nick?
I do not know what you're talking about.
Was it Joe Walker set that details up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "so what?".
You are not getting near.

I think the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing kid?
Hang in there.
Bon appetite.
How are you doing there babe?
- I can't do it.

Babe, the clock is ticking.
We don't have enough time.
Come on.
Do not panic.
Angie.
It's a sunny day.
Crowd's cheering.
Yes.
"Jump into my arms" "We're with you"
Listen to that they are all cheering for you.
They are on our side.
Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
All right.
Just relax.
Focus.
You must do this thing fast before the heat sensor caught up with you.
"Light" as a "flake"
I heard that.
Yes, yes.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
Can't yet.
The whole world knows you are now, Nick.
You inspired every reporters to look into your story.
If you're innocent it will come out.
I'm not going back to custody.
They're going to kill me.
Nick.
Do leave me hanging out here.
Look.
Just I need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
That I have him wired.
I'm supposed to be relieved.
But I stay down because I knew.
Only then,
Suddenly I didn't know.
It's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey Mercer.
You want to take a look at these.
He had bomb kinetics in his cell.
Angie, You're with me.
Tell me what you see.
I see a mass of wires.
Coming out of a circuit.
All right.
Now, Find the main processor.
Like a big hole around it.
- You found it?
- Yes.
- I got it.
- Okay.
As you have practiced, we got to sort it out to take out the sensors.
First cut the red wire.
The red wire?
There are all red wire.
Nick, it's because of the light.
Maybe pick the reddish one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it Nick.
Shut up and listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one.
Hell is going to break loose.
Done.
Good girl.
Okay,
Now touch the wire to the processor.
All right.
It is much easier.
Can make a small spark.
Angie.
Angie?
Angie?
Angie, You hear me?
- You all right?
- Don't talk to me right now.
- Okay?
I can now confirm that the Bomb Squad has just arrived on the scene and
Tactical units are on their way up to the roof on Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is that a bomb?
You ask for my trust and then this?
This is the moment you make your choice remember?

He will go over before he gets taken down.

Babe the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Get in there.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it.

Having you killed.
Or watching you two suffer to your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good to see you Dave.
Security.

We knew he had accomplices.

Yeah I know what's in the file evidence.
What's not in the file.
Ok look.
It wasn't enough for the courtroom.
But internally he is destroying circumstantial on two other cops.
They are Mike Ackerman and Dante Marcus.

Where is it?
- Throw him off.
- Hold on.
What are you doing?
- Do not do it, Nick.

- Shut up.
Impressive.
There are two kinds of people in this world.
People would do anything what they want
And everybody else.
You lose Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got ten seconds Nick.
10 or I'm going to throw your brother.
Right off the roof.
Hey buddy.
She had a pretty rough day.
Now do what she says.
- Cops have keys you Douche.
- I don't know if this a great idea.
You know what?
You promised a suicide today.
Give this people what they want.

Right enough of you doing it.
Leave him alone.
- No it's fine.
- It's between us you piece of shit.
- You let him go.
- Jump.
Me, please.
- Mark!
- Are you okay?
Calm.
Look, I'm Sorry Nick.
I didn't know he was going to set you up.
I'm not going to prison.
Just not that guy you know?
Police shot.
I need urgent a doctor, on the roof.
Hey, run away.
Once again, the police firing.
Dave!
Sorry Nick.
In one way or another ...
Nick.

I am innocent.
Not guilty.
I love you!

I love you.
You got eyes in the back of your head?
Cause I'm not through with you pal.

Mr Cassidy has proven that you are innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But ...
I will be proud to work with you again.
You did a good out there.
Thanks Daugherty.
Thank you.
Looks like the governor came through.
I'll let you two say goodbyes.
See you around Daugherty.
One coming out.
- You're okay?
- Yes.
Let's get out of here.
I figure walk out the back.
There's a million reporters.
Now letting you off the ledge You gonna live as enemy?
Spill it.
What?
What ...
How do you get the diamond?
Let's go to some place quiet.
That's right Dann.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
We experienced both good.
We are well known.
Hey bartender.
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
I'm afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Hahaha.
Lydia?
Meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
- Alive and well.
- Pleasure to meet you again.
- I am honored.
- No kidding?
They are your sons.
Out.
Nick.
- Hey.
- I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
No time.
Hey guys quiet down.
Quiet down.
Shut up.
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
Oh yes.
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Enter it.
I'm going to assume that's a family errand?
It is now.
Drinks all around.
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
All right.
Calm down.
Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel.
21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized
- for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
... of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
- who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world , what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of.23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
- All right.
Calm down.
- Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right.
That print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Getaway from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Goon.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!

Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.

So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.

I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.

- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
(SIGHS)
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.

Thank you, Father.

NICK:
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.

You, too.
Hey, Joey.

Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30$, looks like a professional type.

Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.

If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
MARCUS:
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
(MARCUS READING)
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.

We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
(HANGS UP)
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.

Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
(SIGHS) Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.

Tick-took.
Five!

- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
TOM:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
MONICA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
(INDISTINCT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER) Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
JOEY:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two... (ALL SHOUTING)
- One!
- Don't!

Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(COUGHING)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.

It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.

- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
MORALES:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
TOM:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(CLANKING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...

Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
MAN 1:
Get on with it already!
MAN 2:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(SHUSHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
JOEY:
See?
ANGIE:
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
MARCUS:
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent".
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE RINGS)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
MAN 1:
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
WOMAN:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work, we go to war.
MAN 2:
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you, you take it back.
MEN:
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
MERCER:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL SHOUTING)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
(INDISTINCT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
SECURITY GUARD:
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
MARCUS:
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(SIREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(INDISTINCT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(SIREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
MAN:
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(SIGHS)
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Bon appétit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
DOUGHERTY:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(SIGHS)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
NICK:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you out the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
ANGIE:
- Done.
(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
NICK:
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
MERCER:
Okay, I'm coming over.
NICK:
Come on.
MERCER:
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
LUTZ:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
MARCUS:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
ANGIE:
It's gotta be here!
Right?
JOEY:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
JOEY:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
DOUGHERTY:
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
ACKERMAN:
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
NICK:
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
(YELLING)
No!
Oh, no!
(GRUNTS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
MORALES:
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
LUTZ:
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
DETECTIVE:
LOOK at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
(BEEPING)
(GUN COCKING)
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
(DOOR CLOSES)
- Nina!
Ackerman!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(SIGHS)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
COMMANDO:
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
COMMANDO:
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
JOEY:
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
NICK:
Just stay there!
COMMANDO:
Stay down!
(SCREAMS)
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
MAN:
Let me see!
I wanna see!
(WOMAN 1 SCREAMS) WOMAN 2:
- Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
(GRUNTING)
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
(GROANING)
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
(GROANING)
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
COMMANDO:
Hands in the air!
MERCER:
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
COMMANDO:
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
MERCER:
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
MARCUS:
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
MARCUS:
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
ANGIE:
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
NICK:
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
MARCUS:
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLING)
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
(CROWD SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
COP:
- There he is!
Let's go!
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
(YELLING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
MORALES:
Are you getting that?
NICK:
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
MAN:
He has the diamond!
NICK:
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
NICK:
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
DOUGHERTY:
Crazy day, huh?
(CHUCKLING)
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
(ALL CHEERING)
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
(ANGIE GASPS)
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
(ALL CHEERING)
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
(POLICE ON MY BACK PLAYING)
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
- All right.
Calm down.
- Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right.
That print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Getaway from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Goon.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
- All right.
Calm down.
- Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right.
That print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Getaway from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Goon.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
All right.
Calm down.
Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel.
21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized
- for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
... of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
- who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world , what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of.23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.

Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.

PSYCHIATRIST:
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
(GUARD CLEARS THROAT)
No kissing.

I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
(SIGHS)
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- ALL:
Amen.
- Thank you.
JOEY:
Thank you, Father.

I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.

NICK:
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.

Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- GUARD:

You better not come back here.

- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.

Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.

Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
MARCUS:
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
(MARCUS READING)
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?

Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
(HANGS UP)
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.

Is my hair okay?

(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
(SIGHS) Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.

Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
TOM:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
MONICA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
(INDISTINCT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump That's why they're here.
But I do care.
JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER) Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
JOEY:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two... (ALL SHOUTING)
- One!
- Don't!
(CROWD YELLING)
(EXPLOSION)
MAN:
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(COUGHING)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
(BEEPING)
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.

- What's going on?

- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.

Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
MORALES:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
TOM:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(CLANKING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
MAN 1:
Get on with it already!
MAN 2:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(SHUSHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
JOEY:
See?
ANGIE:
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right.
That print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
MARCUS:
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE RINGS)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
MAN 1:
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
WOMAN:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work, we go to war.
MAN 2:
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you, you take it back.
MEN:
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
MERCER:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL SHOUTING)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
(INDISTINCT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
SECURITY GUARD:
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- MARCUS:
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(SIREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(INDISTINCT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(SIREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
MAN:
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(SIGHS)
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Bon appétit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
DOUGHERTY:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(SIGHS)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
NICK:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
ANGIE:
- Done.
(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
NICK:
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
MERCER:
Okay, I'm coming over.
NICK:
Come on.
MERCER:
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
LUTZ:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
MARCUS:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
ANGIE:
It's gotta be here!
Right?
JOEY:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
JOEY:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
DOUGHERTY:
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
ACKERMAN:
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
NICK:
- Getaway from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
(YELLING)
No!
Oh, no!
(GRUNTS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- MORALES:
Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- LUTZ:
Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
DETECTIVE:
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
(BEEPING)
(sun COCKING)
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
(DOOR CLOSES)
- Nina!
Ackerman!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(SIGHS)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
COMMANDO:
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
COMMANDO:
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
JOEY:
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
NICK:
Just stay there!
COMMANDO:
Stay down!
(SCREAMS)
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
MAN:
Let me see!
I wanna see!
(WOMAN 1 SCREAMS)
- WOMAN 2:
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
(GRUNTING)
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
(GROANING)
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
(GROANING)
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
COMMANDO:
Hands in the air!
MERCER:
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- COMMANDO:
But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- MERCER:
We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- MARCUS:
That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- MARCUS:
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- ANGIE:
No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- NICK:
Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- MARCUS:
Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLING)
Goon.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
(CROWD SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- COP:
There he is!
Let's go!
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
(YELLING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
MORALES:
Are you getting that?
NICK:
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
MAN:
He has the diamond!
NICK:
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
NICK:
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
DOUGHERTY:
Crazy day, huh?
(CHUCKLING)
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
(ALL CHEERING)
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
(ANGIE GASPS)
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
(ALL CHEERING)
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
(POLICE ON MY BACK PLAYING)
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side.
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
Hurting?
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's because I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
All right.
Calm down.
Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- 0n the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service unit at the Roosevelt,
45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are you?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move them back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
I'll look into it.
Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
0f course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
No, I'm not on the rotation.
No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of them in the city.
Go figure.
- The fire chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
3 2 1 Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the grim reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a wasting.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
5 Five!
4 Four!
3 Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff.
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that
I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of them.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
Anything at JFK?
No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
0kay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
Not today there isn't.
I've taken care of the Planning Commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
It is the most important meal of the day.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
This is gonna come down to your choice.
I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
Are you kidding me with this?
As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
What?
It's the news.
... of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
One has to wonder about her suitability...
I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
Everything's in place.
Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
5 4 Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
5-1 Five, one... 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
Clear the goddamned air space!
Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
You allow that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumper's jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
Something's off.
That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
Get on with it already!
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that,bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
ID NO. 32001-41
ID NO. 74145-65
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
What the hell is going on?
What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
He wants people to think he didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is
Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
I can't get it.
It won't stay!
Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Put of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
Nothing you wanna tell me?
You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this,
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name,
Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up,
Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appetit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
Done.
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
It might spark a bit.
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
Involved in what?
There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
We will sweep up, room to room.
Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!

Good morning, sir.
Last name's Walker.
Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit on the east side I can offer you at the same price.
No.
I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne.
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Up there!
Look!
Right there!
Where?
Right there!
Call 9-1-1!
Hit him!
So, your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop... can handle a 25-year sentence.
Nick... have you ever considered hurting yourself?
Hurting
Mm-hm.
No.
But killing...
Every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
That's new, Mike.
Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so... gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
Oh, you know...
Life goes on, right
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Go on.
No.
We gotta flip this.
We dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want He ask for money again
It's your dad.
Yeah
He's he's dying.
How long
Soon.
I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
Alright
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
...and when a good soul is taken from us... it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise - and faith in yourself - is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
Amen.
Thank you.
Thank you, Father.
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there.
Okay
Yeah.
Ma'am !
No contact!
Hey...
Pretty girls can break the rules.
I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Î, yeah?
You know what We're doin' real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
Break it up, you two!
Break it up!
Get up!
You better get back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
Calm down.
Calm—
Put your gun down!
Time's up!
Down!
The hell are you doin'?
!
Put the gun down!
You got 2 kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
Have you lost your mind?
Keys!
On the belt.
Hurry!
You better not come back here.
I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
See him?
I can't see anything.
Check the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt. 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
What do you say, John?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
That'll make a mess.
Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
Call for the bag.
Bring the bag.
Just get away.
Alright, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
Park my vehicle.
Yes, sir.
I want mobile command here pronto.
Right away.
Get this gas truck outta here.
Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses too.
I don't want this guy falling' on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
C'mon.
Dougherty, report.
Alright.
Hang tight.
Yeah. 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30's, looks like a professional type.
And he's not talking.
Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen.
I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody.
Okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
Alright.
If that's what. this is about, what do you say we come inside...
We'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, I jump.
Do you understand?
I'll look into it.
Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
Wants Mercer.
What?
He says if we don't get her, he's goin' off.
His 'Last Supper?
'
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
"I will exit this world as I entered - innocent."
Yeah.
More likely he's goin' to the nuthouse.
Alright.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
Are you kiddin' me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure.
Why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
Alright, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
No.
I'm not on the rotation.
No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
The Fire Chief wants a word.
Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
3... 2... 1...
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the Stock Market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suze Morales reporting live from Midtown...
Stretch it to the corners, alright?
Alright, I got it.
Don't shove me, man.
Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit...
Mercer.
You good to work?
Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI.
He asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about 2 minutes.
2 minutes.
Go get him.
2 minutes.
He ask for help?
No.
Is he drunk?
He doesn't appear to be.
Wedding ring?
Nope.
Demands?
Just to see your pretty face.
1 minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But... time is a wastin'.
Have you processed these yet?
Yeah.
Another rough night?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
5...!
4....!
3...!
2...!
Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me... that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge... and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
Clear the room.
I'm not goin' anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you 5 minutes.
We're gettin' a lot of static from the store owners.
Get more crowd control.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
This job of yours... it's a grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hopin' you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I...
I bet you're not too popular with the "boys' club."
TOM Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
Anything at JFK?
No.
Anything at the borders?
No.
He's not gonna make a mistake like that.
Tom, listen.
Yeah.
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
Alright.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
5 minutes up already?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
Well, it's for the children's wing.
Right?
Right.
In this economy, it's the least I can do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
Yeah.
Of course.
Thanks.
Okay.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
Not today there isn't.
I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can.
David... please...
What's this?
It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
You know, when I sold my first building... the bank sent over 4 hookers, a pound of cocaine... and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
$240 for breakfast?
It is the most important meal of the day.
Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
My mother always said that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah.
Be my pleasure.
You want a smoke?
No.
Mr. Walker...
What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's goin' on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here... they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick...
Can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
...And I'm asking you to help me understand what's goin' on.
We're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust. 'Cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
To jump or not to jump.
This is gonna come down to your choice.
I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, Bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
Alright, let's go.
In breaking news we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer...
Are you kidding me with this?
!
you may recall...?
she was criticized for her handling...
What?
It's the news.
of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge... where a young officer lost his life.
One has to wonder about her suitability...
I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well...people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that,
Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in 2 minutes.
Would you try and relax?
Everything's in place.
Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie.
Grab this.
Catch.
How're you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hopin' he jumps in time for the mornin' shows?
No...!
I give him an hour.
I'll take the under.
$50.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's lookin' at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Oh yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching cops, hold on.
10 seconds.
Really?
What?
You're doing that now?
6... 5... 4...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
No...
You don't have to do this.
For me it's family...and for Nick.
Yeah.
But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
Alright.
Besides... you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back.
Ready?
Ready?
Yeah.
It's your show, Bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
What— No!
3...
Hey!
Look at me!
2...
Walker!
Look at me!
1...!
Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
You alright?
Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell... if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
5, 1... 5, 1, 6, 22, star.
This is Suze Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
What's goin' on?
Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Frickin economy.
Where is it?
The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Ofyour dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothin' made sense he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
Just the 2 of us.
No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
Move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's goin' on up there?
!
Hang on!
Clear the goddamned air space!
Get this outta here!
Are you kidding me?
!
Who is the man on the ledge?
What drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure:
He has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist...
Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you alright?
You want me to trust you?
!
That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just gimme your hand.
Come on.
You alright?
Yeah.
So, Mercer.
What are we thinking?
Jumpers jump, right?
Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
Something's off.
That's what I'm thinkin'.
But what?
It's like he's waitin' for somethin'.
We need this ID.
Alright.
I'll see what I can do.
Suze Morales reporting from Midtown... where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up... and the unidentified man...
Go on!
Is he gonna jump?
Go on!
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Yeah, jump!
Get on with it already!
Are you gonna jump or what?
!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really goin' on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
"RUNNING PRINT 5 MINUTES"
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
Okay.
We're clear.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
You're so stupid.
Wait...
There's somethin' new here.
Do you see it?
No.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
Let me see.
Hold on.
No, let me see.
See?
Back up.
Back up.
What is it?
That's a sensor.
How do you know?
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about.
Okay.
Joey...
In high school, I used to... break into houses sometimes.
You broke—
Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great, so you were a thief?
No!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes.
Unless the clothes fit.
Is there anything else?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
Alright.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
- Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me...
I'd be havin' dinner at
Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're lookin' at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
Bottle of wine...
That sounds hot.
I need more than that, Bro.
What are you saying?
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down... before you get into trouble.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweatin' down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just lookin' out for you.
Is she hot?
Oh...
It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
Cool it down...?
Yeah.
Cool it down.
Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40,000,000 diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is across the street.
What the hell is going on?
What did his note say?
"I will exit as I entered - "
"...innocent."
He wants people to think he didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for 5 years.
So...
Do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
Detective—
Right now.
What the hell...
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
3 years ago, when the market tanked... they said we were finished.
Remember?
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
In this city, on this island... we don't go to work... we go to war.
Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you... you take it back.
Hear hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another - that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
Cheers!
Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
So what?
It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious.
Does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm startin' to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure your boss is gonna send a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun, jerking me around?
No!
2 years ago, I'm doin' a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
"Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond."
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
Today, I'm puttin' it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts. (nuts: slang, insane; emotionally disturbed)
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sippin' Tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Lookin' over your shoulder, sleepin' with one eye open...
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses I'm not goin' back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
Watch your backs.
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearin' me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on...!
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
That's the entrance.
Yeah.
Got it.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
I can't get it.
It won't stay!
Get the gear!
Keep out of the way!
Get out of here!
How're you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
Alright.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm fifteen, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander.
But I can assure you the situation's under control.
Have you been outside?
Yeah.
It's no accident this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in 2 hours.
The only place Cassidy's goin' is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
Wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
Got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1...9... 6...7...
Pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
Whoa...
And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's gettin' into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling' up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
Do your thing.
So, where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show.
Can you get him off the ledge?
Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus.
Give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes.
Then I send in Tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothin' else you wanna tell me?
C'mon, move!
Shit!
Come on!
Nothing you wanna tell me?
You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously...
Okay.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander... until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge... who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
It's a circus.
I don't believe this.
Oh, man...
Time is runnin' out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to
Chappaqua, 2 of his thugs, guys in masks... knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
The jury didn't believe that.
That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent 2 years banging my head against a brick wall... 'cause I know the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost 30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
If he needed cash, he could've sold it.
No.
He wouldn't do that.
He's too damn proud.
2 weeks after my conviction...
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And - ppfft!
- he's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
Come on!
Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day you can really save someone.
Please...
If you are lying to me about any of this...
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barkin' orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
I'll take these up.
You do that.
Angie...
Angie...
What?
You're movin' artwork, girl.
So... what was the best sex of your life?
You, Joey.
Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school...
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't mess with me.
Let's go.
When was that?
A week after the heist.
Did IA have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
That's great.
That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please.
Mercer.
Marcus?
Go.
What if there were other cops involved with this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department...
I'd say you're on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
Remember when somebody disappeared a million bucks of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name:
Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
A week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
Roger that.
It's game time, gentlemen.
Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
Pouch and headset, please.
Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go!
Piece of cake, right?
No.
No?
What do you mean, no?
I don't think I'll fit in there.
Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
Alright?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
Im gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get outta here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
!
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't've?
Mike Ackerman.
Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
I wanna talk to him.
Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
So what?
So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not gettin' near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doin'.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How're ya doin', kid?
I'm hangin' in there.
Bon appetit.
How're you doin' in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
The clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
C'mon.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
"JUMP INTO MY ARMS" ... "WE ARE WITH YOU"... "SINGLE?"
They're cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah...
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody.
They're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here!
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved.
But I stayed on because I knew.
Only then... suddenly I didn' t know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires... coming out of a circuit board.
Okay.
Now find the main processor.
It'll look like a like a big low building.
You got it?
I got it.
Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take care of the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire!
Nick, it's her light.
Baby, pick the reddest one.
Hold on.
She can do it.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If she cuts the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on..
You can do it.
Done!
Good girl.
Okay.
Now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay.
That sounds easy enough.
It might spark a bit.
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
Are you alright?
Don't talk to me right now.
Okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene... and Tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer.
Tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
Alright.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
Goddamn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
!
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
Oh!
Mercer, get back in here!
Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
I am so hot for you right now.
Yeah?
Yeah.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
Okay.
I'm comin' over.
Oh shit...
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
You want us to try and grab her too?
Are you kiddin' me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
It's gotta be here!
Right?
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh no...
Hell, no...
No?
!
Hey, Nick.
Just...
Just...
What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
!
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here!
Say again?
I'm sorry, Bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh shit... !
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
- Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in 5 minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's!
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them outta here.
Please give us a second.
Thank God.
Find them!
I'm on it.
Okay...
listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys... they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean they don't know.
Marcus.
She's coming back in now.
Get your people set.
All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal
Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said you would talk to me.
That's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me 5 minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So... are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass.
Dougherty, what the hell's goin' on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
What?
!
Son of a bitch!
Alright.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
I can't do that.
Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
Involved in what?
There is someone talking' to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
Alright.
Clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doin'?
!
I'm your friend.
Jesus Christ.
Get away from me!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
!
No!
Oh no... !
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off Tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
Come on!
They can't. stop us!
Hey...!
Paul!
Get this guy!
Get outta my way!
Come with me.
- Okay... sir!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
Sir!
Sir!
You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
We will sweep up, room to room.
Everyone break in teams of 2.
Floor by floor.
Sorry!
What the - ?
Look at this.
What?
Heat packs.
They must have tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
Who are you?
You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for 5 weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
Hijo de puta.
Oh, she speaks too.
Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family...
You drag 'em through the gutter, then think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more:
having you killed... or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in 2 days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
Of course, sir.
Name's Cassidy.
You're all set, Mister Cassidy.
Thank you.
You folks have a great day.
You, too.
Goddamn it!
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamn hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
Yeah.
Go.
Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file.
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom... but internally we have strong circumstantial on 2 other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get outta the way!
Move!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you alright?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
Just stay there!
Stay down!
Get down!
Are you okay?
Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
Asshole!
It always ends the same: blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from, Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
He's not armed!
I'm not armed!
Hands in the air!
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
Get down on your knees!
Hey, easy!
Get down.
But keep your hands in the air!
Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
We got him!
On your knees!
Now!
Do not drop your hands!
Get your hands up!
Alright!
We got it!
It's under control!
Mercer!
Stand down.
It's under control, Marcus.
I said stand down!
I'm not goin' anywhere!
That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Let's go.
You're gonna arrest me?
Take her down to command.
Get off me...!
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
!
You sonofabitch!
Yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
We're clear.
No!
Joey!
I love you.
It's gonna be okay, baby.
No!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mister Cassidy:
you're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flyin'.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
It's got nothin' to do with him!
Where is it?
Throw him off!
Hold on!
What are you doing?
Don't do it!
Shut up!
Don't do it!
Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want... and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds.
10... or I'm gonna throw your brother off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea...
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
Now it's 5!
It's between us!
Let him go!
4...!
Let him go!
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on...
Take it easy.
Look...
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof...
- He's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry.
Hey, one way or another...
Nick!
No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
David!
There he is!
Let's go!
Alright, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
!
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
!
I'm an innocent man!
He has the diamond!
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
They're gonna love you in prison.
Mister Cassidy, you've proven you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
You okay?
Yeah.
Let's get you outta here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
Spill it.
What?
"What?"
How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy... has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Maybe longer.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
'Fraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia... meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shittin' me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
Girlfriend.
Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down... !
Just quiet down.
Quiet... !
Angela Maria Lopez...
Will you marry me?
Hell, yes.
Yeah?
Let me see it.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
Do you like it?
Oh yeah...!

Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.

PSYCHIATRIST:
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
(GUARD CLEARS THROAT)
No kissing.
(CHUCKLES)
(SIGHS) Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
(SIGHS)
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- ALL:
Amen.
- Thank you.
JOEY:
Thank you, Father.
FATHER LEO:
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
(EXHALES)
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
(GUARD CLEARS THROAT)
ANGIE:
Okay, I'll see you.
I'll see ya, babe.
NICK:
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
(GRUNTS)
Hey!
Break it up, you two!
Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
JOEY:
Get off me!
Get away!
GUARD:
All right.
Calm down.
Calm... (GROANS)
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- GUARD:
On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
NICK:
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!

Get a paramedic out here, now!
COP 2:
See him?
COP 1:
I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
ACKERMAN:
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
(SIGHS)
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.

WOMAN:
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- MAN:
Where?
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
(CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON MEGAPHONE)
What do you say, John?
How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
TRAFFIC COP:
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
FIREMAN:
Call for the bag.
COP:
Bring the bag.
Just get away.
All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
I want mobile command here pronto.
Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
MAN:
Don't do it, man!
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
I'll look into it.
Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
MARCUS:
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
(MARCUS READING)
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(GROANS)
(EXHALES)
Shit.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yeah?
DOUGHERTY:
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel.
21st floor.
Right now.
(HANGS UP)
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
CAMERAMAN:
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.

Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?

All right, got it.
(INDISTINCT)
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.

Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
MARCUS:
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
(SIGHS) Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
(CROWD SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
Clear the room.
I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
TOM:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
MONICA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
Not today there isn't.
I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
What's this?
It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
(INDISTINCT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump That's why they're here.
But I do care.
JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER) Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy All right?
To jump or not to jump.
This is gonna come down to your choice.
I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
Everything's in place.
Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
JOEY:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two... (ALL SHOUTING)
- One!
- Don't!
(CROWD YELLING)
(EXPLOSION)
MAN:
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Are you okay?
Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(COUGHING)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
(BEEPING)
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
COP:
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
MAN:
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
DOUGHERTY:
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
Clear the goddamned air space!
Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
MORALES:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
TOM:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(CLANKING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
Something's off.
That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
MAN 1:
Get on with it already!
MAN 2:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(SHUSHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
Do you see it?
No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
JOEY:
See?
ANGIE:
Back up.
Back up, back up, back up.
What is it?
That's a sensor.
How do you know?
I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right.
That print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
MARCUS:
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
What the hell is going on?
What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
He wants people to think he didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE RINGS)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
MAN 1:
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
WOMAN:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work, we go to war.
MAN 2:
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you, you take it back.
MEN:
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
MERCER:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL SHOUTING)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
Watch your backs.
Stay back!
Stay back!
(INDISTINCT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
That's the entrance.
Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
I can't get it.
It won't stay!
Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
SECURITY GUARD:
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
MARCUS:
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(SIREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
Nothing you wanna tell me?
You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(INDISTINCT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
It's a circus.
I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.

If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(SIREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
I'll take these up.
You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
MAN:
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(SIGHS)
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Bon appétit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
DOUGHERTY:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(SIGHS)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
NICK:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
ANGIE:
- Done.
(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
NICK:
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
Are you all right?
Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
I am so hot for you right now.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
MERCER:
Okay, I'm coming over.
NICK:
Come on.
MERCER:
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
LUTZ:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
MARCUS:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
ANGIE:
It's gotta be here!
Right?
JOEY:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
JOEY:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
Get your people set.
All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
DOUGHERTY:
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
I can't do that.
Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
Involved in what?
There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
ACKERMAN:
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
NICK:
- Getaway from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
(YELLING)
No!
Oh, no!
(GRUNTS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
Come on.
They can't stop us!
Get out of my way!
MORALES:
Come with me.
Come with me.
Come on, somebody!
Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
We will sweep up, room to room.
LUTZ:
Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
DETECTIVE:
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
(BEEPING)
(sun COCKING)
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
Who are you?
You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
She speaks, too.
Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
(DOOR CLOSES)
- Nina!
Ackerman!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(SIGHS)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
COMMANDO:
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
COMMANDO:
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
JOEY:
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
NICK:
Just stay there!
COMMANDO:
Stay down!
(SCREAMS)
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
MAN:
Let me see!
I wanna see!
(WOMAN 1 SCREAMS)
- WOMAN 2:
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
(GRUNTING)
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
(GROANING)
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
(GROANING)
Okay!
Okay!
He's not armed!
I'm not armed!
COMMANDO:
Hands in the air!
MERCER:
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
Nick, get down.
COMMANDO:
But keep your hands in the air!
Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
Down on your knees.
MERCER:
We got him!
We got him!
Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
Get your hands up!
Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
It's under control!
Mercer!
Stand down.
It's under control, Marcus.
I said stand down!
I'm not going anywhere!
MARCUS:
That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
You gonna arrest me?
Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- MARCUS:
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- ANGIE:
No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
I love you.
It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- NICK:
Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
Don't do it!
MARCUS:
Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLING)
Goon.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
(CROWD SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- COP:
There he is!
Let's go!
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
(YELLING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
MORALES:
Are you getting that?
NICK:
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
MAN:
He has the diamond!
NICK:
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
NICK:
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
DOUGHERTY:
Crazy day, huh?
(CHUCKLING)
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?

All right.
We're good.
Joey.
They're in.
Go, go, go, go.
We gotta go.
Joey, talk to me.
Angie.
Damn.
Go, go, go.
Disarm 15th lobby.
Hallway sensors.
What is this son of a bitch.
Doing on my building?
I do not know Mr. Englander.
But I can assure you that the situation is completely under control.
- Under Control?
You've been outside?
- Yeah?
It is not accidental that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy is going, Is back into the custody.
- It's over before you know it.
- You are goddamn embarrassment.
You rep this up now, Or you'll be sucking fumes on a parking scooter.
In a stagnant island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina, Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander's detains it's high rollers.
Disarm the vault room.
The floor is wired with sizes of sensors.
Over there we got light sensors and body heat sensors.
And that's before you get to the vault.
- It's all clear.
- Nobody is going to get into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
Yeah?
- This is Nestor.
- Englander is clear detective.
Good.
At least the son of a bitch corner my ass anymore.
Roger that.
It's over.
Mercer.
What is that doing here?
- There's a fugitive situation.
Ain't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He's acting like he really believes he's innocent.
Yeah?
What does that make?
An honest man or sociopaths.
He ain't an honest man.
I'm going to put an end to this show up here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
- He likes me.
- Marcus.
- Marcus give her a little more time.
- You have 15 minutes.
Then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lads.
All right.
Let's go, "thief".
Are you sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Move come on!
Ahh shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell?
- You're trying to cheat me?
You don't want know everything.
- Nobody does.
- I'm sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
The best sex of my life?
Obviously.
Hey.
Okay.
Wait.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Step back.
The "Monarch" Diamond is most recently held by David Englander.
Until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy
The man on the ledge.
Who set off to untraceable pieces and sold it.
Time is running out here Nick.
Tactical is on scene.
And I'm tired of being played.
How far would you go?
To take down a man who stole everything from you?
Your Honor.
Your Family.
What would you do?
You do whatever it takes.
After I drove them to tropical
Guys in masked knocked me out and he just stood there smiling.
- But the jury didn't believe that Nick.
- And even did my lawyer.
And I already spent two years banging my head against the brick wall, because I know, that the "Monarch" never left his hands.
Why Englander to steal his own diamond?
He lost 30 million to Lehman.
And about 20 million in a real estate bust.
He was that close to being a bankrupt.
If he needed the cash he could have sold it.
No.
He won't do that.
Cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction, Louis of London sent me a check 40 million for claims.
And he's back.
Come one.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on.
- Who are the thugs?
I don't know.
But know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops.
You what it's like when they are doing back on you
When your hostage is gone
Today is the day that you are really gonna save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this.
I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You got a little to comfortable to bark at us.
Wassup?
How he's doing?
Hasn't kill him yet.
What does he talking?
You know, Mikey ...
One day you you gonna stick your dick, in the wrong door, and someone's gonna slam it.
I got some paper in his cell in Sing Sing.
- Take it up to Daugherty.
- Let me see them.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie ...
What?
You are a living work of art.
Damn.
So.
What the best sex of your life?
No doubt, with you Joey.
- Yes?
- Now ...
There's this one guy in high school ...
He's older He had his hands.
Don even mess with me.
Let's go.
- And when was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did they have anything?
- Everyone expect the diamond
- The the case goes apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
- Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing is happening.
Across the street?
He can't steal something twice, especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
- What if he didn't do it?
- Please, Mercer.
Marcus?
Go.
What if there's were other cops involved in the Englander case?
If you try to get yourself even more despise in the department, I'll say you are into something.
I just found out that Cassidy was co-operating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappears about a million bucks worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave them a name Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
A week after Cassidy went up.
Walker and his car got pulled up of the hut.
Yeah yeah, alcohol level was point 2.3.
Can you stop while you're behind.
Who ever was in it with Walker.
Had every reasons to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegations.
I know Cassidy is not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What he's saying?
Fuck you.
- Lads, get your people into positions.
- Now!
- Roger that.
It's game time gentlemen.
- Strapped them?
- Yep.
Let's
Go, Go, Go.
Piece of cake right?
No.
No.
- No?
- No
- Why not?
- I don't think i'll fit in there.
Hey listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like what we practiced.
Or Nick would kill me
Nick will kill you?
- I am going to kill you.
- Be mad just be mad at the vent.
Get out of here.
Yes?
Done.
Yes huh.
Now you see that?
Now you see that?
This occurs when driven to madness.
This what happens when we push too far.
There's no rich guy in prison.
Nick Cassidy, Would be any of us.
Nick Cassidy has always maintains he's innocent.
Do you actually believes he stole the "Monarch" Diamond?
I hope he had done it.
Who wouldn't?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Daugherty.
Welcome to the party.
- Brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Thank you.
Hey.
I'm Lydia Mercer.
- I want to talk to him.
- Yes ...
Do you work for Englander or was it just Nick?
I do not know what you're talking about.
Was it Joe Walker set that details up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "so what?".
You are not getting near.
- There's my friend out there.
-And this is my scene.
Daugherty would you talk to her.
Look man that's the lady's call.
We'll will call you if we need you.
- Thank you.
- I hope you better know what the hell you're doing.
- What's this?
- I brought up some food.
I think the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing kid?
Hang in there.
Bon appetite.
How are you doing there babe?
- I can't do it.
- What?
Babe, the clock is ticking.
We don't have enough time.
Come on.
Do not panic.
Angie.
It's a sunny day.
Crowd's cheering.
Yes.
"Jump into my arms" "We're with you"
Listen to that they are all cheering for you.
They are on our side.
Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
All right.
Just relax.
Focus.
You must do this thing fast before the heat sensor caught up with you.
"Light" as a "flake"
I heard that.
Yes, yes.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
Can't yet.
The whole world knows you are now, Nick.
You inspired every reporters to look into your story.
If you're innocent it will come out.
I'm not going back to custody.
They're going to kill me.
Nick.
Do leave me hanging out here.
Look.
Just I need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
That I have him wired.
I'm supposed to be relieved.
But I stay down because I knew.
Only then,
Suddenly I didn't know.
It's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey Mercer.
You want to take a look at these.
He had bomb kinetics in his cell.
Angie, You're with me.
Tell me what you see.
I see a mass of wires.
Coming out of a circuit.
All right.
Now, Find the main processor.
Like a big hole around it.
- You found it?
- Yes.
- I got it.
- Okay.
As you have practiced, we got to sort it out to take out the sensors.
First cut the red wire.
The red wire?
There are all red wire.
Nick, it's because of the light.
Maybe pick the reddish one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it Nick.
Shut up and listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one.
Hell is going to break loose.
Done.
Good girl.
Okay,
Now touch the wire to the processor.
All right.
It is much easier.
Can make a small spark.
Angie.
Angie?
Angie?
Angie, You hear me?
- You all right?
- Don't talk to me right now.
- Okay?
I can now confirm that the Bomb Squad has just arrived on the scene and
Tactical units are on their way up to the roof on Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is that a bomb?
You ask for my trust and then this?
This is the moment you make your choice remember?
Mercer.
Tactical a go.
Time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stay down Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.

(SIGHS)
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
(DOG BARKING)
[WOMAN]:
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- MAN:
Where?
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
(CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON MEGAPHONE)
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
[TRAFFIC COP]:
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- [FIREMAN]:
Call for the bag.
- [COP]:
Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff... that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
[MAN]:
Don't do it, man!
(INDISTINCT)
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
Alright, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
[MARCUS]:
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
(MARCUS READING)
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(GRPANS)
(EXHALES)
Shit.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yeah?
[DOUGHERTY]:
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
(HANGS UP)
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
[CAMERAMAN]:
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
[MAN 1]:
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
[MAN 2]:
All right, got it.
(INDISTINCT)
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- [MAN]:
Don't shove me, man.
- [COP 1]:
Hey!
Back up!
[MAN]:
I got a right to walk where I want.
[COP 2]:
All sealed off.
(SIGHING) Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
[MARCUS]:
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
Pne minute!
(SIGHS) Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
(CRPWD SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
(DPPR PPENS)
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
Pne way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, alright.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed 'till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
[TOM]:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
[MONICA ON SPEAKERPHONE]:
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
Not today there isn't.
I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
It is the most important meal of the day.
- Mh-hm.
- Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
(INDISTINCT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
[JOEY OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER]:
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned... that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
Are you kidding me with this?
As you may recall, she was widely criticized...
- for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
One has to wonder...
- about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Pbviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Pvernight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
[JOEY]:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two... (ALL SHOUTING)
- One!
- Don't!
(CROWD YELLING)
(EXPLOSION)
[MAN]:
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(COUGHING)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
(BEEPING)
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- [COP]:
Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
[MAN]:
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
[DOUGHERTY]:
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
[MORALES]:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist...
- who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
[TOM]:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(CLANKING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- [MAN 1]:
Get on with it already!
- [MAN 2]:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(SHUSHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
- (GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
[JOEY]:
See?
[ANGIE]:
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- [MARCUS]:
Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on yourjumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered"...
- "Innocent".
He wants people to think he didn't do it.
Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE RINGS)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious... when I, uh... decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- [MAN 1]:
Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
[WOMAN]:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- [MAN 2]:
Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- [MEN]:
Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending... a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
[MERCER]:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL SHPOUTING)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
(INDISTINCT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Put of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
Whoa!
And that's before you even get to the vault.
[SECURITY GUARD]:
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- (CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- [MARCUS]:
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(SIREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Pbviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(INDISTINCT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander... until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
If he needed cash,
- he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(SIREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick... in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- [MAN]:
A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(SIGHS)
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
Ifyou're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of 23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you".
Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Bon appetit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
Pn the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
[DOUGHERTY]:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(SIGHS)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
[NICK]:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- [ANGIE]:
Done.
- (EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- [NICK]:
It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- [MERCER]:
Okay, I'm coming over.
- [NICK]:
Come on.
[MERCER]:
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
[LUTZ]:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
[MARCUS]:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- [ANGIE]:
It's gotta be here!
Right?
- [JOEY]:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
[JOEY]:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
[DOUGHERTY]:
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
Involved in what?
There's someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name they're gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- [ACKERMAN]:
I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- [NICK]:
Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
(YELLING)
No!
Oh, no!
(GRUNTS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- [MORALES]:
Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- [LUTZ]:
Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
[DETECTIVE]:
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
(BEEPING)
(GUN COCKING)
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Nina!
Ackerman!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(SIGHS)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
[COMMANDO]:
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
[COMMANDO]:
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
[JOEY]:
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- [NICK]:
Just stay there!
- [COMMANDO]:
Stay down!
(SCREAMS)
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
[MAN]:
Let me see!
I wanna see!
- (WOMAN 1 SCREAMS) - [WOMAN 2]:
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
(GRUNTING)
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
(GROANING)
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
(GROANING)
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- [COMMANDO]:
Hands in the air!
- [MERCER]:
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- [MERCER]:
We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- [MARCUS]:
That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- 'MARCUS]:
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What're you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- [ANGIE]:
No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- [NICK]:
Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- [MARCUS]:
Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLING)
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
(CROWD SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- [COP]:
There he is!
Let's go!
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
(YELLING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
[MORALES]:
Are you getting that?
[NICK]:
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- [MAN]:
He has the diamond!
- [NICK]:
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back ofyour head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
[NICK]:
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
[DOUGHERTY]:
Crazy day, huh?
(CHUCKLING)
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
Pne coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
(ALL CHEERING)
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
(ANGIE GASPS)
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
(ALL CHEERING)
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
(POLICE ON MY BACK PLAYING)

I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back

Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?

'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
- All right.
Calm down.
- Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30$, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In a way.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent".
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you out the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Get away from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
LOOK at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!
Well, I'm running Police on my back
I've been hiding Police on my back
There was a shooting Police on my back
And the victim Well, he won't come back
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
Yes, I'm running down the railway track
Could you help me?
Police on my back
They will catch me if I dare drop back
Won't you give me all the speed I lack?
I been running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Running Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
What have I done?
What have I done?
'Cause I'm running
Good morning, sir.
- Last name's Walker.
- Yes.
Mr. Walker.
Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.
Is it too early for champagne?
Not at all, sir.
Not at all.
Look!
There's a man up there!
Look!
Right there!
- Where?
- Right there!
Somebody call 911!
Hit him!
That's right, take him down!
All inmates...
So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
- It's okay.
No kissing.
Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Father.
- I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.
Likewise.
Anything I can do, just let me know.
I'll be there, okay?
Yeah.
Ma'am!
No contact!
Hey.
Pretty girls can break the rules.
- Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!
Get off me!
Get away!
- All right.
Calm down.
- Calm...
Down!
Down!
Put your gun down!
- Time's up!
- Down!
The hell are you doing?
Put the gun down!
You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.
All right.
Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!
This is 3-12, prisoner escape!
All backup units, prisoner's heading to the east gate!
Get a paramedic out here, now!
- See him?
- I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- Where?
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
- Call for the bag.
- Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
Don't do it, man!
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
Shit.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Stretch it full down to the corners, all right?
All right, got it.
Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.
- Don't shove me, man.
- Hey!
Back up!
I got a right to walk where I want.
All sealed off.
Shit.
Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
Mercer.
Welcome back.
It's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
Let's go.
Tick-tock.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff...
It's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours...
It's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
- It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump That's why they're here.
But I do care.
Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, we're here, we're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized for her questionable handling...
- What?
It's the news.
...of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
It's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two...
- One!
- Don't!
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
- 5-1-6, double 2, star.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah, jump!
- Get on with it already!
- Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
See?
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numbnuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
- It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right.
That print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
- "I will exit as I entered..." - "Innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
- we go to war.
- Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
- you take it back.
- Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
- It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
It's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass any more.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
- It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay.
It's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick'll kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man.
It's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
Bon appétit.
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie.
It's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- Done.
Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
- Okay, I'm coming over.
- Come on.
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
- You want us to try and grab her, too?
- Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
- It's gotta be here!
Right?
- I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- Getaway from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
No!
Oh, no!
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show any more!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
- Nina!
Ackerman!
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
- Just stay there!
- Stay down!
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
Let me see!
I wanna see!
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
- Hands in the air!
- Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
- It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
- It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
- It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
Goon.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- There he is!
Let's go!
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
Are you getting that?
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
- He has the diamond!
- I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
Crazy day, huh?
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spill it.
- What?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
It's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!

Room 2105, South Tower.
Great view.
We also have a larger unit available on the east side
I can offer you at the same price.
No, I think I'll stick with the view.

So your final appeal has been denied, Mr. Cassidy.
That's why I am here.
It's a waste of time.
Can I go?
Mmm-hmm?
Your old life is over.
You're gonna have to accept that it's never coming back.
Not many men, let alone an ex-cop, can handle a 25-year sentence.
Mmm-hmm.
Nick, have you ever considered hurting yourself?
- Hurting?
- Mmm-hmm.
No.
But killing, every goddamned day.
Go ahead.
Hey, Cass.
It's been a while.
Yes, it has.
- That's new, Mike.
- Yeah.
I went shopping.
I'm about to be a married man, so gotta clean up a little bit.
Who's the lucky guy?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
You know, man.
Hey, life goes on, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
- Go on.
- No, we gotta flip this.
I mean, we dig up some new evidence.
There's things we can do.
You know?
-It's okay.
-(GUARD CLEARS THROAT)
No kissing.

(SIGHS) Your brother called.
I'm sorry.
What'd he want?
He ask for money again?
It's your dad.
- Yeah?
- He's...
He's dying.
- How long?
- Soon.
Look, I'll talk to the warden.
I'll get you a day outside of here.
No hassles.
- Mmm.
- All right?
Take care of yourself.
Yep.
(SIGHS)
And when a good soul is taken from us, it's hard to find reason to believe.
But having faith in God's promise, and faith in yourself, is your one true ally.
God bless you, Frank Cassidy.
You are truly free.
Amen.
- ALL:
Amen.
- Thank you.
JOEY:
Thank you, Father.
FATHER LEO:
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Cass.
I'm sorry, man.
It's nice to meet you, Nick.

Yeah.

Okay, I'll see you.
- I'll see ya, babe.
NICK:
Is this the best you could do?
View of the goddamned tracks?
You killed him the day you went to prison.
That's 'cause I left him with a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
You know, Nick, we're doing real good without you.
Yeah, looks like it.
(GRUNTS)
- Hey!
Break it up, you two!
- Break it up!
Come on.
Get up!
Get your ass back to prison!

Calm down.

You got two kids, Donnie.
Think about it.

Take it easy, Nick.
Now get down and sit on your hands!
You, too.
Hey, Joey.
Keys.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Keys!
- GUARD:
On the belt.
- Hurry!
You better not come back here.
NICK:
Yeah, I didn't plan to.
I'm sorry, but you, too, Joey.
Get down!
Nobody move.
Way to make Dad proud!

COP 1:
Get a paramedic out here, now!
COP 2:
See him?
COP 1:
I can't see anything.
- Check the back.
- Look in the back.
ACKERMAN:
What the hell happened?
He jacked the guards and took my car.
Jesus.
(SIGHS)
He's an escaped felon, Mikey.
They're gonna kill him.
(Doe BARKING)
WOMAN:
Look!
There's a man up there!
- Look!
Right there!
- MAN:
Where?
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
We got a guy on the roof.
I need an Emergency Service Unit at the Roosevelt, 45th and Madison.
Shut down the block.
We got a man on a ledge.
(SIRENS WAILING)
Back up!
Back up!
45th Street, between 5th and Madison, is closed.
(CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY ON MEGAPHONE)
- What do you say, John?
- How are ya?
You gotta be kidding me.
- That'll make a mess.
- Oh, yeah.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
TRAFFIC COP:
No pedestrians.
No vehicles.
FIREMAN:
Call for the bag.
COP:
Bring the bag.
- Just get away.
- All right, Mr. Walker.
Stay calm.
My name is Jack Dougherty.
I'm here to help.
- Park my vehicle.
- Yes, sir.
- I want mobile command here pronto.
- Right away.
- Get this gas truck out of here.
- Okay.
Get the street locked up.
Businesses, too.
I don't want this guy falling on someone's head.
Get all these people back.
We gotta move 'em back farther.
Let's do it.
Come on.
Dougherty, report.
All right.
Hang tight.
Yeah, 21st floor.
Jumper's mid-30s, looks like a professional type.
- And he's not talking.
- Got it.
Detective Marcus.
Listen, I need to talk to anyone on your staff that had any sort of contact with him.
Bellhops, clerks, anybody, okay?
Yes, sir.
MAN:
Don't do it, man!
((INDISTINCT))
Mr. Walker...
I want a woman.
All right, look.
If that's what this is about, what do you say we come inside, we'll take care of whatever you need.
Blonde?
Brunette?
You name it.
Detective Lydia Mercer.
If she's not here in 30 minutes, then I jump.
Do you understand?
- I'll look into it.
- Then I guess we're done talking, Jack.
You're not gonna believe this.
- Wants Mercer.
- What?
He says if we don't get her, he's going off.
MARCUS:
His "Last Supper"?
Not a good sign.
And take a look at this.
(MARCUS READING)
Yeah.
More likely he's going to the nuthouse.
All right.
I want the print guys up here.
Get an ID.
And call Mercer.
What?
Are you kidding me?
Seriously?
You'll back her up.
You're my guy.
Sure, why not?
Everybody loves a good train wreck, right?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
(GROANS)
(EXHALES)
Shit.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yeah?
DOUGHERTY:
Jesus Christ, Mercer, did I wake you up?
Of course not.
Hang on.
Just hang on a sec.
Are you kidding me?
We don't have time for this.
Mercer?
Mercer?
All right, what?
We got a jumper, and you're up.
- No, I'm not on the rotation.
- No shit.
The Roosevelt Hotel. 21st floor.
Right now.
(HANGS UP)
Oh, crap.
Roger that.
We've got links with traffic control, the precinct, and the hotel.
Get the cameras up.
Anything on J. Walker?
We've got over 600 of 'em in the city.
Go figure.
- The Fire Chief wants a word.
- Got it.
It looks like we're in for a show.
Let's get it.
Right over here.
Let's go from where he swerves around.
Ready?
Is my hair okay?
CAMERAMAN:
Gorgeous.
Don't fluff me, Paul.
Three, two, one.
Unlucky in love?
Victim of the stock market?
A young man contemplates death.
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.

All right, got it.

Oh, man.
Good luck hitting this.

Mercer.
- You good to work?
- Absolutely, sir.
You'd better be.
Get to it.
MARCUS:
Mercer's on her way up.
Enter the Grim Reaper.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Mercer.
Welcome back. it's so good to see you again.
Kiss my ass, Jack.
FYI, he asked for you.
By name.
What's the scene?
Suicide note.
His name is Walker, but we haven't made him yet.
And he's not talking, other than to say he's gonna go off in about two minutes.
Two minutes.
- Go get him.
- Two minutes.
- He ask for help?
- No.
- Drunk?
- He doesn't appear to be.
- Wedding ring?
- Nope.
- Demands?
- Just to see your pretty face.
One minute!
(SIGHS) Coffee?
Please.
Don't make me beg.
You got it.
But time is a-wastin'.
- Have you processed these yet?
- Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) Another rough night, huh?
10 seconds!
(CROWD SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)
Let's go.
Tick-took.
Five!
Four!
Three!
- Two!
- Mr. Walker?
I'm Detective Lydia Mercer.
I understand you asked for me.
(DOOR OPENS)
What brings you out here today?
Aside from the view?
Trust me, this staring off into the abyss stuff... it's no good.
Today is the day that everything changes.
One way or another.
What's gonna change?
I'm ready to die.
It's important to me that you understand that.
I understand.
Oh, yeah.
Why me, Mr. Walker?
Hmm?
If you're really ready to die, why'd you bring me up here?
You're famous.
Last month you were with a jumper on a bridge, and he died with the whole world watching.
I just wanted to know that I could get a good crowd for when I go off.
Wow.
Really nice work.
Very impressive.
I saw the connection you guys made.
It was nice.
- Clear the room.
- I'm not going anywhere.
My scene.
My room.
Get out.
You heard her, guys.
Let's go.
Way to keep your cool.
Nicely done.
I'll give you five minutes.
We're getting a lot of static from the store owners.
Do I care?
I mean, get more crowd control, all right.
Don't break my balls about this.
The street stays closed till I say it's safe.
You got any friends or family you want me to call for you?
No.
My father's dead.
Is that why you're out here?
In away.
Do you want to talk about it?
You know, this job of yours... it's a pretty grim way to make a living.
I prefer to focus on the people I help.
I'm hoping you're one of 'em.
You got a lot of friends on the force?
Enough.
I bet you're not too popular with the boys' club.
(CHUCKLES)
TOM:
Yeah, it's him.
No doubt.
- Anything at JFK?
- No.
Anything at the borders?
No, he's not gonna make a mistake like that.
- Tom, listen.
- Yeah, what?
I want you to look through all the cell phone and credit card records.
Nick and Joey Cassidy.
Okay.
Right.
Anything reoccurring, anything unusual.
You run it through me.
All right.
I want to find him first.
I'd sure appreciate it if you kept the gloves on.
Five minutes up already, huh?
I didn't ask for this, Detective.
You back me up.
Are you in or out?
In or out?
I'm in.
Let's go, guys.
I'll tell you what, Monica.
MONICA: (ON SPEAKERPHONE) Uh-huh.
I'm listening.
I'll host a dinner for the Gold Circle patrons and their families.
David, I don't know what to say.
That would be incredibly generous.
- Well, it's for the children's wing, right?
- Right.
Yeah.
I mean, in this economy, that's the least I could do.
You're a dream.
I knew I could count on you.
- Yeah.
Of course.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
Bye.
Mr. Henry is here, sir.
What is it, Ted?
There's a problem.
- Not today there isn't.
- I've taken care of the planning commission.
It's the councilman.
It's too much of a risk if they tie that money to me.
Look.
I'll talk to Frank, see if he has someone who can...
David, please.
- What's this?
-It's a gift.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
You know, when I sold my first building, the bank sent over four hookers, a pound of cocaine, and then they flew us all to Paris on their private jet.
Now that was a gift.
Tell me it's done, Ted.
Hmm?
Tell me it's done!
Thank you for the watch.
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?
240 bucks for breakfast?
- It is the most important meal of the day.
- Yeah.
Anything else unusual you noticed?
He's got honest eyes.
- You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
- My mother used to always say that.
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.
They did the whole place?
A little strange, don't you think?
Tell Mercer.
Yeah, be my pleasure.
(INDISTINCT)
Hey.
You want a smoke?
No.
- Mr. Walker...
- What?
I know you're desperate.
I can see that.
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.
I don't know what's going on here.
But I can tell you, these people down here, they don't care about you.
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.
But I do care.
JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER) Nick, can you hear me?
Is this thing working yet?
And I'm asking you to help me understand what's going on.
We're here, We're here, We're here.
Just don't freak out.
I asked for you, because I needed someone I could count on.
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are, this ain't gonna end well.
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.
My choice?
My only choice is easy.
All right?
To jump or not to jump.
- This is gonna come down to your choice.
- I don't understand what that means.
You're late!
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.
Yeah.
And you're the one person in Manhattan who knew it would be.
You ready?
All right, let's go.
In breaking news, we have just learned that the negotiating officer is Lydia Mercer.
- Are you kidding me with this?
- As you may recall, she was widely criticized
-for her questionable handling...
- What?
it's the news.
...Of last month's tragic incident on the Brooklyn Bridge, where a young officer lost his life.
- One has to wonder about her suitability...
- I'm sorry.
Roy, turn that off.
I hate this bitch.
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?
I don't sleep since that happened.
It replays over and over in my mind.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?
Obviously somebody with a history, right?
Why don't I have the guys go look at some mug shots?
And you get back to the EDP.
The investors are running about 30 minutes behind.
There's a jumper on the building and traffic's a mess.
Why don't these people just shoot themselves in the head?
Overnight time locks go down in two minutes.
Would you try and relax?
- Everything's in place.
- Yeah?
Everything but you.
Angie, grab this.
Catch.
How you doing way up there?
Hey, Angie.
Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.
Anyone who creates traffic like this in Midtown should be shot.
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.
Are you hoping he jumps in time for the morning shows?
- No!
- I give him an hour.
- I'll take the under.
- Fifty bucks.
Make it $100.
Let's go.
Hey, you see me?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
Don't worry.
Everyone's looking at me.
They were saying on the news you're headed for Canada.
It couldn't have gone better.
You could have pulled your punches a little.
Yeah?
it's been a rough couple years.
Tell me about it.
JOEY:
Switching comms, hold on.
Ten seconds.
- Really?
- Eight.
- What?
- Seven.
- You're doing that now?
- Six.
Five, four...
The night locks should be deactivated.
That's all good.
- Hey, listen.
This is your last chance.
- No.
- You don't have to do this.
- Joey!
No, listen.
For me it's family, and for Nick.
- Yeah.
- But you could just walk away.
We've been planning this for a year.
I'm past committed here.
All right.
Besides, you'd probably screw this up without me.
Don't say that.
No one's screwing this up.
I know.
I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?
- Ready?
- Huh?
- Ready?
- Yeah.
It's your show, bro.
Look at all these people.
(LAUGHS)
Oh, can't disappoint them.
- Hey, what are you doing?
No!
- Three...
Hey!
Look at me!
- Walker!
Look at me!
- Two... (ALL SHOUTING)
- One!
- Don't!
(CROWD YELLING)
(EXPLOSION)
MAN:
Why don't you jump and get it over with?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I've never felt more alive.
(COUGHING)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Nerves of steel.
Think I might need that cigarette now.
Last one.
Do you mind sharing?
I can imagine how it must have felt after that cop jumped.
Cops are superstitious.
And they would've run from you like the plague.
Are you speaking from experience?
But you never quit.
Never.
Last year, you did 68 hours straight in a hostage negotiation.
You got everyone out.
You trusted your instincts.
You never quit.
You never gave up.
Why do you know so much about me?
Because you and I have a lot in common.
I don't think you wanna jump.
Is there a moment when you can tell if someone's gonna go off or not?
Sometimes you know.
Sometimes you can feel them give up.
Don't give up on me.
I'm gonna get you off this ledge.
Since when do you smoke?
See if you can get a partial.
Nice work.
Hey, Nick.
We're in, buddy.
- Five, one...
-5-1-6, double 2, star.
(BEEPING)
This is Suzie Morales reporting live from Midtown.
Someone in this country commits suicide every 17 minutes...
- What's going on?
- COP:
Jumper.
Bet it's a woman drove him up there.
It's money.
Women jump for love.
Men?
We jump for money.
Fricking economy.
- Where is it?
- The Roosevelt.
Is that a photo?
Of your dad?
Yeah.
He always stood by me.
Even when nothing made sense, he stood by me.
People like that are rare.
Why don't you come in and tell me about him?
Where it's safer.
- Just the two of us.
- No.
That's not gonna happen.
Things will get better.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
MAN:
We're just gonna move in for a closer shot.
Boys, get this chopper out of here!
Nick!
Hold on!
DOUGHERTY:
Marcus!
What's going on up there?
Hang on!
Hang on!
- Clear the goddamned air space!
- Get this out of here!
Are you kidding me?
MORALES:
Who is the man on the ledge?
And what drove him to such a desperate act?
Well, there's one thing for sure, he has captured the attention of the entire city.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
For our next segment we are going to talk to a forensic psychiatrist
-who may be able to shed some light...
- Yeah, Tom, what you got?
TOM:
There's a storage unit in the brother's name.
Storage?
You got a location?
Are you all right?
You want me to trust you?
- That wasn't ours!
I'm sorry!
- You're gonna have that?
Come in!
(GRUNTING)
(CLAN KING)
I really hope I didn't need that.
Joey?
Joey!
Just give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So, Mercer, what are we thinking?
- Jumpers jump, right?
- Exactly.
This guy has that capacity, but he's not going over.
- Something's off.
- That's what I'm thinking.
But what?
It's like he's waiting for something.
We need this ID.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Suzie Morales reporting from Midtown, where the eyes of the city are riveted on a ledge 20 stories up and the unidentified man...
- Go on!
- Is he gonna jump?
- Go on!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
- Jump!
- Jump!
Jump!
- Yeah,jump!
MAN 1:
Get on with it already!
MAN 2:
Shit or get off the pot!
Gotta love New York.
Maybe it's time you told me what's really going on here.
Why don't you want us to know who you really are?
Haven't you wanted to escape your past?
To be someone else?
Start again?
- Okay.
We're clear.
- Hey.
How do you know it looks good on the monitors?
(SHUSHING)
It is so hard for me to love you when you do that.
- You're so stupid.
-(GRUNTS)
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
There's something new here.
- Do you see it?
- No, I don't see it.
It's up on the ceiling.
Right there.
- Let me see.
- Hold on.
No, let me see.
Let me see.
JOEY:
See?
ANGIE:
Back up.
- Back up, back up, back up.
- What is it?
That's a sensor.
- How do you know?
- I know.
I just know.
Do you really wanna talk about this right now?
That depends on what we're talking about, doesn't it?
Okay, Joey.
In high school, I used to break into houses sometimes.
- You broke...
- Really expensive houses.
That's how I know what that is.
Great.
Great, so you were a thief?
No, no, no!
I used to watch TV and try on clothes, you know?
Unless the clothes fit.
And that's all.
Is there anything else you want to tell me about?
You got any felonies you failed to mention?
Excuse me?
Take it down a notch.
All right?
Because you probably would've set that shit off.
All right.
Do me a favor.
Visualize something positive.
If you could be anywhere in the world, what would you be doing?
Nick, we got something that isn't on the plans.
Nick?
Come in.
Come on, anything.
Nick, I need you, man.
We've got a problem here.
What do you mean?
We don't know what it is.
It's some kind of sensor.
Like, if it was me, I'd be having dinner at Roberto's.
Tell me about it.
Babe, tell him what you're looking at.
It's a little black bulb on the ceiling about 4 inches across.
It's this little Italian joint in the Bronx.
Roberto does amazing things with truffles.
- Bottle of wine...
- That sounds hot.
I'm gonna need a little more than that, bro.
What are you saying?
I need an answer here.
Listen.
This thing that we got here.
I think we should cool it down before you get into trouble.
Look, Nicky.
Numb-nuts.
This is not a candlelit dinner.
We're sweating down here.
What is it?
This thing?
I'm just looking out for you.
Is she hot?
- Oh!
-It's a heat sensor.
We have to cool it down.
- Cool it down.
- Yeah.
- Cool it down.
- Yes.
Why don't you come in this window and I'll let you take me to lunch?
It's tempting.
But I don't think it's a good idea.
You got someplace better to be?
If I'm right, that print you pulled off our cigarette's about to come through.
What's it gonna tell me?
Bags.
Son of a bitch.
- MARCUS:
Listen up.
- Go.
Mercer, I got an ID on your jumper.
He's an escaped convict.
Nick Cassidy.
Cassidy.
The cop that stole the diamond off David Englander?
The $40 million diamond.
I knew I recognized this mutt.
Englander owns this hotel.
His office is here.
His Jewelry Exchange is right across the street.
- What the hell is going on?
- What did his little note say?
-"I will exit as I entered..." -"innocent."
- He wants people to think he didn't do it.
- Good luck with that.
I think he's more interested in just having an audience.
Son of a bitch.
Pull his file.
Find his family.
Toss his cell.
Who'd he ride with?
Mike Ackerman.
Jesus.
I can't believe this.
How's he doing?
Well, he's playing this very cool.
Like this is all some sort of game.
He always insisted he was innocent.
Do you believe that?
Look, he was my partner for five years.
So do you think he would jump?
He's got nothing to lose.
I'm on my way.
(PHONE RINGS)
First Line Security.
This is Nestor.
Yeah, Nestor.
This is Detective Marcus over at the Roosevelt Hotel.
You work for me today.
I need you to open up Englander's shop.
- Detective...
- Right now.
(HANGS UP)
That's it, baby.
Chisel.
(GRUNTING)
Hello, everybody.
I'm glad you could make it.
I wish my dad could see this.
He was an immigrant.
Worked his ass off in the jewelry trade.
So he was more than a little anxious when I decided to risk it all in real estate.
(PEOPLE CHUCKLING)
That's why I bought the Monarch Diamond.
You know, when I could.
To honor him.
You know, three years ago, when the market tanked, they said we were finished.
- Remember?
- MAN 1:
Yeah.
But that's what's great about this country.
If you want it bad enough, you can make it back.
Hmm?
WOMAN:
True.
In this city, on this island, we don't go to work,
-we go to war.
- MAN 2:
Yes!
And if somebody takes something from you,
-you take it back.
- MEN:
Hear, hear!
And more.
I had one precious jewel taken from me a few years ago.
But now I've got another that no one will ever steal from me.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're finally here.
To my new jewel, the Monarch Spire!
- Cheers!
- Congratulations, David.
You pulled it off.
Excuse me, sir.
They've ID'd the jumper.
- So what?
-It's Nick Cassidy.
Nick Cassidy.
Convicted felon.
I didn't mean to disappoint you, Lydia.
I'm just curious, does this little show have a point?
'Cause I'm seriously starting to doubt your suicidal tendencies.
And I'm sure that your boss is gonna be sending a team across the street right now.
Hold on!
Nick, we're not ready yet!
Yeah, right now.
MERCER:
Are you having fun jerking me around?
Are you trying to manipulate me?
No!
Two years ago, I'm doing a moonlighting gig.
Real simple.
Escort David Englander up to Chappaqua with the Monarch Diamond.
Yesterday, I'm doing 25 years for apparently stealing it.
And today?
Today I'm putting it all on the damn line.
And I need your help.
You are nuts.
You care, remember?
You played this all wrong, Nick.
David Englander set me up.
You could've been sipping tequila on a beach in Mexico.
(NICK CHUCKLES)
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Looking over your shoulder, sleeping with one eye open.
That isn't freedom.
Standing here in front of all these TV cameras is?
No one is gonna shoot me with their grandmother watching.
Maybe you should tell me the rest of your plan.
The plan is to prove that I'm innocent.
And this?
This is my retrial.
I'm innocent!
(ALL SHOUTING)
I'm an innocent man!
Did you get that, Lydia?
I'm innocent!
Now you go downstairs and tell your bosses that I'm not going back.
Can you do that for me?
Tell me, Lydia.
Yeah, Nick.
I'll go do that.
Here they come.
Party of four.
Let 'em through.
Make way.
- Watch your backs.
- Stay back!
Stay back!
(INDISTINCT)
Hey, Nick, you hearing me?
We need more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's make it rain.
(GRUNTS)
You can't cross here.
What is that?
It's money!
I love this guy!
Make way!
Make way!
(CROWD CLAMORING)
- That's the entrance.
- Got it.
Yeah.
Got it.
Here.
Take the camera.
Right here.
Right here.
(GRUNTS)
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
They're animals!
- I can't get it.
It won't stay!
- Get the gear!
Get the gear.
- Keep out of the way!
Out of the way!
- Move!
Get out of here!
How are you doing, babe?
It won't stick!
Just take a breath!
You can do it.
I need you guys to turn around.
All right.
We're good.
Joey, they're in.
Go!
Go!
Go!
We gotta go!
Joey, talk to me.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Disarm 15, lobby.
(BEEPS)
Come on.
Hallway sensors.
(BEEPS)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
What is the son of a bitch doing on my building?
I don't know, Mr. Englander, but I can assure you the situation's completely under control.
- Under control?
- Yeah.
- Have you been outside?
- Yeah.
It's no accident that this is happening today.
I've got a major press conference in two hours.
The only place that Cassidy's going is back into custody or splat on 45th.
This is a goddamned embarrassment.
You wrap this up now, or tomorrow you're sucking fumes on a parking scooter in Staten Island.
You got it?
Yeah.
Nina!
Get me the Mayor's office.
This is where Englander entertains the high-rollers.
1-9-6-7, pound.
Disarm the vault room.
(MACHINERY CLANKING)
(BEEPS)
The floors are wired with seismic sensors.
And over there we've got light sensors and body-heat sensors.
- Whoa!
- And that's before you even get to the vault.
SECURITY GUARD: it's all clear.
Nobody's getting into that beast.
After you, gentlemen.
-(CELL PHONE RINGS)
- Yeah?
It's Nestor.
Englander's is clear, Detective.
Good.
I don't need that son of a bitch crawling up my ass anymore.
Roger that.
Let's go.
Mercer.
Why is tactical here?
- It is a fugitive situation, isn't it?
- MARCUS:
Do your thing.
So where are we at?
He is acting like he really believes that he's innocent.
Yeah?
What's that make him?
An honest man or a sociopath.
He ain't an honest man.
And I'm gonna put an end to this show out here.
- Can you get him off the ledge?
- Yes.
He likes me.
Marcus, give her a little more time.
You have 15 minutes, then I'm sending tactical.
You got it?
Lutz?
Let's go, thief!
You sure there's nothing else you wanna tell me?
(SIREN WAILING)
Come on.
Move!
Come on!
Shit!
Come on!
- Nothing you wanna tell me?
- You're starting to chafe me.
You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.
Sure I do.
Boyfriends?
Girlfriends?
Best sex of my life?
Well...
Obviously.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay, wait.
Hold on a sec.
(INDISTINCT)
The Monarch Diamond was most recently held by David Englander until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy, the man on the ledge, who was said to have cut it up into untraceable pieces and sold it.
-It's a circus.
- I don't believe this.
Oh, man.
Time is running out here, Nick.
Tactical's on the scene and I am tired of being played.
How far would you go to take down a man that stole everything from you?
Huh?
Your honor.
Your family.
What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.
After I drove him to Chappaqua, two of his thugs, guys in masks, knocked me out while he just stood there and smiled.
- The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
- That's right.
And neither did my lawyer.
And I have spent two years banging my head against a brick wall, 'cause I know that the Monarch never left his hand.
Why would Englander steal his own diamond?
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.
He was that close to being bankrupt.
- If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
- No.
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't want to be humiliated.
He's too damn proud.
Two weeks after my conviction,
Lloyd's of London sent him a check for 40 million for a claim.
And, poof!
He's back.
Come on.
I need you to believe me.
- Come on!
- Who were the thugs?
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.
Cops?
You know what it's like to have everyone turn their back on you.
Even those closest to you.
Today is the day that you can really save someone.
Please.
If you are lying to me about any of this, I'm gonna push you off myself.
Watch him.
You're getting a little too comfortable barking orders.
(SIREN WAILING)
What's up?
How's he doing?
Mercer hasn't killed him yet.
Is he talking?
You know what, Mikey?
One day you're gonna stick your dick in the wrong door and someone's gonna slam it.
I've got some papers from his cell in Sing Sing.
Take 'em up to Dougherty.
Let me see those.
- I'll take these up.
- You do that.
Angie, Angie, Angie.
What?
You're moving artwork, girl.
So what was the best sex of your life?
- You, Joey.
- Yeah?
Well, there was this one guy in high school.
He was older.
He had these hands...
Don't even mess with me.
Yeah?
Let's go.
When was that?
- MAN:
A week after the heist.
- Did I have anything?
Everyone expected indictments, but the case fell apart.
- That's great.
- That's all I got.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
Are we sure nothing's happening across the street?
You can't steal something twice.
Especially if it's been cut into a million pieces.
What if he didn't do it?
Please, Mercer.
(SIGHS)
- Marcus?
- Go.
What if there were other cops involved in this Englander thing?
If you're trying to get yourself even more despised within the department,
I'd say you're really on to something.
I just found out Cassidy was cooperating with IA.
About what?
You remember when somebody disappeared about a million bucks' worth of cocaine out of evidence?
Cassidy gave 'em a name, Joe Walker.
Same name he checked in under.
And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.
Yeah.
He had a blood alcohol level of .23.
Why don't you stop while you're behind?
Whoever was in it with Walker had every reason to set Cassidy up.
You don't know that Walker did it.
It's just an allegation.
I know Cassidy's not on this ledge to say goodbye.
Yeah?
What's he saying?
"Fuck you."
- Lutz.
Get your people into position.
Now!
- Roger that.
Okay. it's game time, gentlemen.
- Let's go.
Let's get your straps on.
- Yes.
- Pouch and headset, please.
- Got it.
Pouch.
Headset.
Headset.
Let's go, go, go.
Piece of cake, right?
(ANGIE BREATHING HEAVILY)
- No.
- No?
What do you mean, no?
- I don't think I'll fit in there.
- Babe, listen.
You can't hold my weight.
All right?
We don't have time to talk about this.
Just like we practiced or Nick will kill me.
Nick will kill you?
I'm gonna kill you.
Be mad.
Just be mad in the vent.
Get out of here.
Did I stutter?
You see that?
You see that?
This is what happens when a man gets pushed too far!
Right?
It's always the little guy who takes the hit!
There's no rich guys in prison.
Nick Cassidy could be any of us!
Nick Cassidy has always maintained his innocence.
Do you believe he actually stole the Monarch Diamond?
I hope he did.
I would've done it.
Who wouldn't have?
- Mike Ackerman.
- Jack Dougherty.
Welcome to the party.
- I brought the papers from Sing Sing.
- Great.
Hi.
Lydia Mercer.
- I wanna talk to him.
- Yeah.
You ever moonlight for Englander, or was it just Nick?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Was it a Joe Walker who set that detail up for you guys?
- So what?
- So he did?
I didn't say he did.
I said, "So what?"
You're not getting near him.
That's my friend out there.
And this is my scene.
Dougherty?
Will you talk to her?
Look, man. it's the lady's call.
We will call you if we need you.
(EXHALES) Thank you.
You better know what the hell you're doing.
And what's this?
I brought up some food.
I thought the kid might be hungry.
How are you doing, kid?
I'm hanging in there.
(CROWD CLAMORING)
Bon appétit.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
How are you doing in there, babe?
I can't do it.
What?
Babe, the clock's ticking.
We gotta go now.
Come on.
Don't panic, Angie. it's a sunny day.
The crowd's cheering.
Yeah!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Listen to this.
They're all cheering for you.
They're all on our side, Angie.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm in.
Good.
Just relax.
Keep it together.
Let's do this thing fast, before the heat sensor catches up with you.
Ah!
Light as a feather.
I heard that!
Yeah, yeah.
Tactical is setting up.
You need to come in.
I can't yet.
The whole world knows who you are now, Nick.
You've inspired every reporter to look into your story.
If you're innocent, it'll come out.
And if I go back into custody, they're gonna kill me.
Nick!
Don't leave me hanging here.
Look.
I just need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.
I trusted that cop.
On the bridge.
I thought I had him wired.
I was supposed to be relieved, but I stayed on, because I knew.
Only then, suddenly I didn't know.
There's nothing wrong with your instincts.
Give me more time.
DOUGHERTY:
Hey, Mercer.
You're gonna wanna take a look at this.
He had bomb schematics in his cell.
(SIGHS)
Angie, it's me.
Okay, what do you see?
I see a mass of wires coming out of a circuit board.
Okay, now find the main processor.
It'll look like a big low building.
- You got it?
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Okay.
Like you practiced, we're gonna short it out to take out the sensors.
First, cut the red wire.
Red wire?
They're all red wire.
Nick, it's her light.
Babe, pick the reddest one.
- Hold on.
- She can do it, Nick.
NICK:
Shut up.
Just listen to me.
If you cut the wrong one, all hell is gonna break loose.
Come on, babe.
Come on, baby.
- ANGIE:
Done.
-(EXHALES)
(GASPS) Whoo!
Good girl.
Okay, now touch the wire to the processor.
Okay, that sounds easy enough.
- NICK:
It might spark a bit.
- Ah!
Angie!
Angie?
Angie?
Do you hear me?
- Are you all right?
- Don't talk to me right now, okay?
I can now confirm that the bomb squad has just arrived on the scene and tactical units are on their way up to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.
Time is running out for this escaped criminal.
(WHIRRING)
Is there a bomb?
You asked for my trust, and then this.
Well, this is the moment you make your choice.
Remember?
Mercer, tactical's a go.
It's time to clear the window.
It's your call.
Stand down, Mercer.
He will go over before he gets taken down.
That's assuming our track record's on par with yours.
All right.
The bomb protocol says we clear everybody but the negotiator.
Clear the building.
No one has found a bomb.
This threat is a stall!
He's playing you!
He picked you, 'cause you're in no condition to do your job!
This is my scene!
My negotiation!
God damn it!
Dougherty, pull her out of there!
Now!
Lydia, come on!
Clear the window!
What are you doing?
Hey!
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Hi!
Jesus Christ!
All units!
This is a hold!
Repeat, no go!
- Mercer, get back in here!
- Shut up!
Stay back!
Just shut up!
Set.
Moment of truth.
Let's see what we've got.
- I am so hot for you right now.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
We're only here for one thing.
One thing.
MERCER:
Okay, I'm coming over.
NICK:
Come on.
MERCER:
Holy shit.
Nice and slow.
Nice and easy.
Holy shit!
LUTZ:
You want us to try and grab her, too?
MARCUS:
Are you kidding me?
We screw up this, it's all our asses.
Check in these, check in these.
Does this mean you believe I'm innocent?
It's a possibility.
Tell me there's no bomb.
Do you see the diamond here?
ANGIE: it's gotta be here!
Right?
JOEY:
I know it's gotta be here.
Oh, no.
- Hell, no.
- No?
JOEY:
Hey, Nick.
Just...
- Just...
- What?
Joey, talk to me.
Tell me what you got.
Who are you talking to?
Who's Joey?
I'm stealing the diamond.
For the first time.
It's not here.
- Say again?
- I'm sorry, bro.
It's not here.
It's not in the vault.
Oh, shit.
Okay, Joey.
You know what to do.
Yeah.
Copy that.
We need to leave in five minutes for the press conference, sir.
Good.
(ALARMS RINGING AND BLARING)
We've got an alarm at Englander's.
Seal the building.
No one gets out.
All squads be advised.
We've got an alarm across the street.
Jesus Christ!
You're kidding me.
Get up there.
Take a look.
They're somewhere in the building.
Start with the ceiling on 15.
Keep them out of here.
Guys, give us a second.
Thank God.
- Find them!
- I'm on it.
Okay, listen.
What if I could get Walker's IA file?
It's not gonna matter.
There's nothing in it.
No, those guys, they're cautious and paranoid.
They don't put shit in the file unless they can prove it six ways to Sunday.
But that doesn't mean that they don't know.
All right, Marcus, she's coming back in now.
- Get your people set.
- All squads stand by.
Jesus, Mercer.
You got a giant set of balls.
They're gonna hang you by 'em, but they are huge.
Where are we with Internal Affairs?
Okay.
He's expecting your call.
(PHONE RINGS)
Internal Affairs.
Evans.
This is Detective Lydia Mercer.
Dougherty said that you would talk to me.
Yeah, that's right.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
You should see this.
What is it?
Just give me five minutes.
Ackerman, open this door!
Detective, I'm telling you right now!
Get back here and open this door!
Hey, partner.
So are you gonna jump or what?
(BANGING ON DOOR)
DOUGHERTY:
Open the fucking door, Ackerman!
Where is everyone?
Where's the negotiator?
Don't worry about them.
It's just me and you on this, Cass, okay?
Dougherty, what the hell's going on there?
Ackerman breached the door!
He locked us out!
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
All right.
Call me back.
Call me back.
Why don't you come on in off this ledge?
Let me help you.
- I can't do that.
- Don't be crazy, Cass.
Come in here.
Cass!
Let me help you.
I always wondered if you were involved in this.
- Involved in what?
- There is someone talking to IA right now.
Whose name are they gonna come up with?
I'm your friend.
Take my hand.
Shoot the lock!
All right, guys, clear out.
Whose name?
What the hell are you doing?
- ACKERMAN:
I'm your friend.
- Jesus Christ.
- NICK:
Getaway from me!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
Take 'em.
I'm your friend!
Then why do you look so guilty?
(YELLING)
No!
Oh, no!
(GRUNTS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GUNSHOTS)
Shit!
Suspect is back in the building.
Secure the corridor.
Get Marcus to call off tactical!
Now!
Mercer!
Get back here!
This isn't our show anymore!
Attica!
They're gonna take him down!
Attica!
Attica!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Paul, get this guy!
- Come on.
They can't stop us!
- Get out of my way!
- MORALES:
Come with me.
Come with me.
- Come on, somebody!
- Okay.
Sir!
Hey, hey, hey!
What are they gonna do, arrest us all?
- Sir!
Sir!
- You wanna shoot something, shoot that!
Lock down floors 21 to 24.
Assemble personnel on 20, with a guest list.
- We will sweep up, room to room.
- LUTZ:
Everyone break in teams of two.
Floor by floor, rolling cover.
Sorry!
What the...
DETECTIVE:
Look at this.
- What?
- Heat packs.
That's what tripped the sensor.
Why would they deliberately set the alarm off?
(BEEPING)
(GUN COCKING)
This is a nice gun.
I like it.
Looks expensive.
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?
I'm the brother.
The one sitting behind Nick in court every day for five weeks.
Remember me now?
How quaint.
And your adorable little Chihuahua.
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
- She speaks, too.
- Shut your mouth!
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Turn around, put your hands on the table.
Thanks for taking off those last couple levels of security.
Nick had you wired.
There it is.
Don't move!
Don't you move.
Bring down my family.
Huh?
You drag 'em through the gutter, then you think you're gonna get away with it?
Babe, the cuffs.
This might hurt.
(HANDCUFFS CLICK)
Back up.
Back against the safe.
Cuff yourself to it.
Do it!
I don't know what I'm going to enjoy more, having you killed, or watching you two suffer through your pathetic little lives.
Whatever.
It's good seeing you, Dave.
-(DOOR CLOSES)
- Nina!
Ackerman!
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
We'll be back in two days.
Could you hold onto this for us?
- Of course, sir.
- Name's Cassidy.
- You're all set, Mr. Cassidy.
- Thank you.
- You folks have a great day.
- You, too.
(GRUNTING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
God damn it.
What?
The brother and the girlfriend have the diamond!
They're in the goddamned hotel!
Jesus.
Cassidy's got a bomb trigger.
Take him out.
Kill shots.
- Yeah.
Go.
- Okay, so here's the deal.
Cassidy put us on to Walker.
A very bad guy.
We knew he had accomplices and, suddenly, he turns up dead.
Which, you know, sort of screwed up the case for us a bit.
I know what's in the file, Evans.
What's not in the file?
(SIGHS)
Okay, look.
There wasn't enough for a courtroom, but internally we have strong circumstantial on two other cops.
A Michael Ackerman and a Dante Marcus.
That's him!
COMMANDO:
Get out of the way!
Go, go!
Everybody's pulling for you, kid!
Take this!
Go, go, go!
COMMANDO:
Everyone, out of the way!
Move!
Where did he go?
Go this way!
JOEY:
Are you all right?
Joey Cassidy.
Room service.
Room service.
I didn't order any room service.
NICK:
Just stay there!
COMMANDO:
Stay down!
(SCREAMS)
Get down!
- Are you okay?
- Get out!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Stay down!
Stay down!
MAN:
Let me see!
I wanna see!
-(WOMAN 1 SCREAMS)
- WOMAN 2:
Oh, my God!
Look!
The guy's up there!
(GRUNTING)
(CURSING IN SPANISH)
It always ends the same, blood, snot and tears.
Now where's the rock, tough guy?
You hit like a girl.
Where you from?
Jersey?
(GROANING)
I'm from the Bronx.
Lutz, you need to call off tactical!
There is no bomb trigger!
We got jack shit here!
Mercer, this is nuts.
I have orders.
Your orders are wrong!
(GROANING)
Okay!
Okay!
- He's not armed!
- I'm not armed!
COMMANDO:
Hands in the air!
MERCER:
Hold your fire!
Guns down!
- Get down on your knees!
- Hey, easy!
- Nick, get down.
- COMMANDO:
But keep your hands in the air!
- Drop your weapons!
Come on, guys!
- Down on your knees.
- MERCER:
We got him!
We got him!
- Down on your knees!
Do not drop your hands!
- Get your hands up!
- Okay, okay.
All right!
We got it!
-It's under control!
- Mercer!
Stand down.
-It's under control, Marcus.
- I said stand down!
- I'm not going anywhere!
- MARCUS:
That's it.
Sergeant, arrest her for obstruction.
Right now, let's go.
- You gonna arrest me?
- Take her down to command.
- Get off me.
- MARCUS:
Move your ass.
What the hell is this?
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, yeah, okay.
What are you gonna do?
We got intel he placed a bomb.
I need you to get your guys back down to 22.
I got this.
Let's go.
Saddle up!
Let's go!
- We're clear.
- ANGIE:
No.
No!
Joey!
Joey!
- I love you.
-It's gonna be okay, baby.
- I love you.
I love you.
- No, no!
I got news for you, pal.
This is not gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know.
Here's where we're at, Mr. Cassidy.
You're dead.
But your efforts have earned you the opportunity to negotiate for the lives of your family.
Tell me where the rock is or your little brother goes flying.
You earned what you got coming.
But the kid?
I'll let him go.
-It's got nothing to do with him!
- Where is it?
- Throw him off!
- NICK:
Hold on!
What are you doing?
- Don't do it, Nick!
- Shut up!
- Don't do it!
- MARCUS:
Shut up!
Impressive.
There's two kinds of people in this world.
People who will do anything to get what they want, and everybody else.
You lose, Nick.
Again.
Clean this mess up.
You got 10 seconds, Nick.
Ten, or I'm gonna throw your brother right off the roof.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
Hey, buddy, she's had a pretty rough day.
I'd do what she says.
Cops have keys, you douche.
I don't know that this is such a great idea.
You know what?
You promised me a suicide today.
Now give these people what they want.
Come on, Nick.
He had nothing to do with it!
You leave him alone.
Now it's five!
It's between us, you piece of shit!
- Four!
- Let him go!
- Jump!
- I'm gonna do it.
Mike!
Are you okay?
(GROANING)
(COUGHING)
(CHUCKLING)
Go on.
Take it easy.
Look.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't know they were going to set you up.
I couldn't go to prison.
I'm just not that guy, you know?
Officer down!
Officer down!
Request immediate assistance on the roof.
Nick, he's getting away!
Repeat!
Officer down!
Officer down!
Nick!
I'm sorry, Nick.
Hey, one way or another...
- Nick!
- No!
(CROWD SHOUTING)
(SCREAMING)
(CLAMORING)
Come on, folks!
Stay back!
- David!
- COP:
There he is!
Let's go!
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN SHOCK)
All right, freeze!
Freeze!
So what's it gonna be?
Hmm?
A shot in the head?
Or back to prison?
(YELLING)
(ALL CLAMORING)
MORALES:
Are you getting that?
NICK:
You thought you'd get away with this?
See?
I'm an innocent man!
MAN:
He has the diamond!
NICK:
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!
I love you, man!
I love you!
You got eyes in the back of your head?
'Cause I'm not through with you, pal.
NICK:
Yeah, they're gonna love you in prison.
Mr. Cassidy, you've proven that you're innocent.
How do you feel today?
DOUGHERTY:
Crazy day, huh?
(CHUCKLING)
But I would be proud to work with you again.
You did good out there.
Thanks, Dougherty.
(DOOR BUZZES)
Looks like the Governor came through.
I'll let you two say your goodbyes.
See you around, Dougherty.
One coming out.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Let's get you out of here.
I figured I'd walk you out the back.
There's like a million reporters.
Now that you're off the ledge, you got nothing to say to me?
- Spin if.
-what?
"What?" How'd you get the diamond?
Let's go someplace quiet.
That's right, Dan.
It has been confirmed that the man on the ledge, Nick Cassidy, has been released from custody.
(ALL CHEERING) it's Cassidy!
Two years in.
Don't I know it.
Bartender!
Change the channel.
I'm sick of this jackass.
Afraid not.
That's my favorite channel.
Lydia, meet my dad.
Your dad?
Frank Cassidy.
Alive and well.
Pleasure to meet you.
Again.
You gotta be shitting me.
You're his father.
Get off now.
I'm so proud of you.
Get your hands off my wife.
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend.
Hold on a second.
Everyone, quiet down.
Just quiet down.
Quiet!
Angela Maria Lopez.
(ANGIE GAS PS)
Will you marry me?
- Hell, yes.
- Yeah?
(ALL CHEERING)
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Try it on.
Try it on.
I'm gonna assume that's a family heirloom.
It is now.
Drinks all around!
- Do you like it?
- Yeah!

Even I can't bring up the system menu.
I see. something like this wouldn't just fall from the sky for no reason.
This is probably...
Yes!
Mommy heard us and dropped it.
Asuna... tell me something.
Where is the gate that leads inside the World Tree?
it's in the dome at the tree's base...
B-But you can't get in! and even the biggest raids couldn't break through!
I have to go anyway...
Thank you so much for everything.
I'll go the rest of the way alone.
Kirito-kun...
Then let's go.
Yeah.
Wh-What?
Is this an event?
do you know the way to this dome?
just go up those stairs and...
Daddy?
The information we've learned so far indicates that breaking in through the gate will be extremely difficult.
Our only choice is to try.
it won't cost our lives.
but... I'm going to go insane.
And you want right?
Yes.
You who know not the heights of heaven...
Do you desire passage to the castle of the king?
Will you attempt the Grand Quest "Guardians of the World Tree"?
Asuna.
I'm almost there.
Then show that you are worthy of letting your wings take flight.
Yui.
Keep your head down.
Daddy.
Go!
Out of the way!
I can do this!
Down you go.
damn it!
Asuna!
Asuna...
Asuna...
Asuna...
Asuna...
Asuna!
Asu—
Just...
Just a little more...
Just a little more...
I...
I... 646)}Resurrection Timer died? I believed this world was just a game.
Is this my punishment for that?
My strength is nothing but skills and status effects.
Resurrection Timer
But I thought I could overcome and do anything.
A game where you can die is too easy.
Asuna...
No...
Stay back!
Kirito-kun!
Kirito-kun...

Kirito-kun...
Leafa.
I d-didn't...
But don't do things like that.
I'm fine.
I don't want to cause you any more trouble.
Trouble?
!
I...
Kirito-kun?
W-Wait!
You can't do it alone!
You may be right... so...
But I have to go.
Stop...
Just stop this.
Go back to being your normal self.
I...
I... you're...
Leafa...
I'm sorry.
nothing will end.
And nothing will begin.
I have to see her again...
I have to see Asuna again.
What...
What did you just say?
Asuna.
Yuuki Asuna
That's the name of the person I'm looking for.
But then...
Then...
That's...
Brother?
Sugu?
Suguha?
This is awful.
This isn't fair...
It isn't...
S-Sugu?
Are you sure you want to log out?
Sugu!
are you there?
Don't!
Don't open the door.
Leave me alone...
Sugu?
too.
I apologize.
But I didn't have a choice.
No...
That isn't it.
That isn't...
Sugu?
I...
I...
I...
I betrayed my own heart!
I betrayed my love for you... to give it up.
To fall in love with Kirito-kun...
I already had!
But...
But...
L-Love?
But we're...
I know.
I already know!
You and I aren't really siblings!
I've known for the last two years.
Wasn't the reason you quit kendo and started avoiding me because you knew the whole time?
Weren't you avoiding me because I'm not your real sister?
!
So...
So why are you being nice to me now?
!
I was so happy you came back from SAO. like when we were little.
I thought you were finally giving me a chance.
But...
If I'd known
I wish you'd kept being a jerk.
I wouldn't have realized I like you...
Or been sad to learn about Asuna-san...
Or tried to fall in love with Kirito-kun instead!
I'm sorry.
Leave me alone...
Sugu...
Next Time:
Bonds
Woman:
You know how it is.
You think your life is normal.
You're happy.
You're a little kid.
Doesn't matter where you are.
Where we were was Brooklyn.
My dad was born there, we were born there.
The main thing I remember is running, always running, to things, from things.
Running with my sister, who was always ahead.
My mom running from the Nazis.
She was like a real-life Anne Frank hiding out during the war, except she lived.
She was rescued by American soldiers.
Dad was the Jewish single one... and they ran away together.
Dad loved to get away, so we were always running somewhere, going somewhere.
Dad liked to promise us the world.
(Man whistling melody)
It's not like we wanted to leave Brooklyn, but all of a sudden, we were.
For someone who was scared of almost everything,
I was okay with that.
I was going to be a famous writer, so, it didn't matter where I lived.
A lot of great writers came from New York, but a lot of great writers came from the South too.
A good writer can write anywhere, like Anne Frank.
She wrote behind a bookcase in the attic.
And we brought our dog buddy, who was 14 and could barely make it around the block.
Girl:
Antarctica.
Mmm.
Atlanta.
Uh...
I got one for you, maddie.
Arkansas, ends with an "s."
I know about the "s." Um...
Come on.
"S" is a no-brainer.
I quit.
What do you mean, you quit?
You can't quit with an "s."
I just don't want to play anymore.
Well, we got 500 more Miles to go.
Got something better to do?
- What about Spain?
- I said I'm done, okay?
Father:
You're done.
You're done with an "s."
What about Seattle, San Francisco,
Saudi Arabia?
Come on.
There's a whole world of s's out there.
Narrator:
I wouldn't miss Brooklyn, not really, but maddie, my sister, she was 17.
She was furious.
She was popular in high school, popular enough to know that nothing was worse than being a new senior in a new high school in the South.
For all we knew, we'd be the only Jewish family in new Orleans.
I'd like a coke, please.
That's a nice accent.
I'm not the one with the accent.
(Laughs) Lenny.
Lenny, please.
Come on.
Let's get the deal papered first because we start talking ipos.
Come on, let's go.
It's getting late.
Daddy, this is the ladies' room.
I want to get going before dark.
What are you wasting time with this yutz for?
Just talking.
Yeah, well, come on.
We're late.
Hey, what's a yutz?
Look in the mirror.
Narrator:
So I asked my dad,
"why are we moving to Louisiana?"
He'd been a new yorker even as a dirt-poor kid.
He told me he needed to be closer to his factory, 400 people making blouses in the South.
Besides, the dollar goes further there, and we'd live like kings.
- (Tires screech)
- Oh, shit.
- (Horn honking)
- You bastard!
Where the hell did you get your license?
!
Narrator:
He always said everything was fine.
I wanted to believe him.
I really did.
But we didn't always know what to believe when it came to dad.
(Bell rings)
Father:
Surprise, surprise.
(Sighs)
So what do you think?
Oh, my God, Joe.
It's incredible.
(Laughs) Oh-hh.
Only the best for my beautiful wife.
This is really it?
What's the matter?
Not enough house for you?
Girl:
Are you kidding?
It's a mansion.
Joe:
Four stories, 8,000 square feet.
And let's not forget the olympic-size swimming pool.
Mother:
No.
(Whimpers)
I'm going to go back to buddy in the car.
Maddie, come on.
Come on.
You're going to love it.
Come on.
Come.
Just come.
What happened to the broker, Joe?
Ah, she couldn't make it, but she didn't want to lose the sale.
You know, she knows a serious buyer when she sees one.
- (Gasps)
- Oh, my God.
Girl:
I love this place.
This was designed by a famous Southern architect.
Wow.
Built like a goddamn fortress.
Maddie:
Or a prison.
Mother:
Maybe we could even have your weddings here.
We'd be just like the Kennedys.
How many bedrooms are there?
More than you could count, kid.
Vaulted ceilings.
Fireplace.
Come on.
We belong in a place like this, right?
Until the guys with the white hoods burn a cross on our lawn.
You know, enough with the snide remarks maddie, okay?
I'm going to choose a bedroom in case he closes the deal.
This is amazing.
I hate this place.
Sister:
Hey, maddie, check this out!
- Listen, I...
- Joe.
Listen, Happy Birthday.
- It's yours.
- It's mine?
That's right.
The house.
I bought it for your birthday.
It's bought and paid for.
I even put it in your name.
For putting up with me all these years, all right?
Joe.
Oh.
Are you sure we can afford this?
Of course we can afford it.
Right now, I got one of the biggest financiers in the country underwriting my company.
I'm building an empire here, Stella.
An empire.
(Sighs)
(Chuckles) What are you doing in there?
There's a crawlspace in this closet.
It's a perfect secret hiding place.
Huh.
Stella:
Girls, come quickly!
Come on.
The house is ours.
Daddy already bought it.
(Sighs) This can't be happening.
(Squeals) When do we move in?
Well, that was the big surprise.
Moving day is today.
I had the movers start packing us up right after we left on Thursday.
They're gonna be here any minute.
(Girl laughs)
But you said we were only looking.
How could you do this to us?
Whoa, whoa.
It was a surprise.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'll take care of her.
Maddie?
Hey, come here.
(Birds chirping)
You have to understand what a step up this is.
You would never find a house like this in Brooklyn.
And besides, your father's plant is here.
He won't have to fly down twice a week anymore.
Don't you have any say in anything?
You act like living in this beautiful house is some form of punishment.
It's going to be okay.
Hmm?
Okay.
Look, it...
I really think it can be different this time, maddie.
I promise.
Your daddy's finally happy here.
Come on.
Can't you just be happy, okay?
Be happy, okay?
Be happy.
Yeah.
(Sighs)
(Movers talking indistinctly)
Be careful with my disco ball there, all right?
- Absolutely.
- Take it easy.
Mover:
Take this.
We are planning to buy new furniture, right, daddy?
What's the matter?
I love that stuff.
All right, that's it.
We are officially moved in.
What do you think?
It's a beaut, right?
(Sighs) Something's not quite right.
Oh.
Now, it's perfect.
- (Laughs)
- Come here.
- What's that?
- Joe:
What's what?
That button.
Oh, that's the panic button.
I installed them everywhere.
You press that button, the precinct is right down the block.
The cops will be here in less than 30 seconds.
They told me not to worry about security, you know, but you don't tell a guy from Brooklyn not to worry about security when it comes to his family.
Right, honey?
There's no way we're going to fit in at this school.
Maybe you won't, but I will.
Joe, ask Natalie to eat, please.
I'll give you 10 bucks if you finish what's in your bowl.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you another 10 bucks if you eat two pieces of fruit.
- Don't bribe her.
- To you, it's a bribe.
To me, it's a long-term investment.
- (Horn honks)
- Okay?
Come on.
The bus is here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on.
Before you go, come on.
Plant 'em.
- Ah.
- Pay up.
Come on.
I give you my lou, all right?
Have a good day.
Bye.
(Machinery clattering)
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning.
Do my eyes deceive me, or have I just walked into a beauty pageant?
- (Laughter)
- Woman:
Sweet talker.
What do you say to charm like that, Mr. f, huh?
Do me a favor, grace.
I want you to call the bank and confirm the wire transfer from crawley, and get me Lenny on the phone.
(School bell rings)
I'm Mr. Smith, and this is poetry seminar 111.
Before we begin to tackle our curriculum
- for you budding poets...
- (Laughter)
I'd like to announce that the sixth annual
Campbell soup poetry competition is now accepting submissions.
This is an opportunity for recognition, prize money...
Perhaps a slice of immortality.
(Laughter)
Here's everything you need to know about making your submission.
Take one and pass it along, please.
My advice, stick with a topic that's personal, something that comes from down deep in the soul.
Page 42 in your poetry books.
Let's tackle a little eliot, shall we?
Natalie fine.
Why don't you start us off reading "the waste land"?
Natalie:
I don't think anyone should be asked to read aloud on their first day in a new school.
Smith:
Miss fine?
And t.S. Eliot was not my favorite.
Cat got your tongue, miss fine?
(Laughter)
On the other hand, let's face it.
I was a coward.
I hated reading in front of people,
I hated speaking in front of people, and I never knew why.
I thought it might be different here, but it wasn't.
(School bell rings)
(Students talking indistinctly)
- I don't know.
- Cindy's over here.
Hi.
Hey, if it isn't the new girl in town.
I'm-I'm Louie.
- Maddie.
- Maddie.
I don't think she likes what she sees, Louie.
So, maddie, you know, I hear...
I hear girls from up north are pretty friendly.
Is that true?
You got something for me?
Oh, back off, Louie.
Why you gotta be such a jerk?
Can't you recognize a lady when you see one?
Guess someone down here's a gentleman.
Sorry about that.
He's kind of an ass.
Hey, we're about to go grab some soft drinks downtown if you want to come with us.
I want to go home.
Maybe next time.
All right.
Louie:
What was that?
What do you mean?
You can't just go up to a stranger, start touching 'em on the leg.
- Dang, man.
- God, man.
She's a Hebrew.
- Really?
- What does that mean?
(Seabirds calling)
(Stella laughing)
(Joe laughing)
Ah, it's just a starter boat, but I got my own private slip to boot, and I'll tell you what.
If you guys like it, I got my eye on a 40-footer.
But wait.
Check out the name over there.
Oh!
Joe.
Oh, Joe.
Oh, I hope you girls have husbands as wonderful as your father.
(Parents laugh)
Maddie:
That water looks very polluted.
It's not polluted.
It's muddy.
It's the Mississippi river.
Come on.
Let's go for a ride.
- No?
Really?
- Get in.
Well, no time like the present.
- Joe, Joe...
- Get in, girls.
Are you sure you know how to drive this?
Of course I know how to drive.
It's a car on water.
What's the difference?
It goes left.
It goes right.
It stops.
It goes.
I can do it.
Here.
How's that look?
Oh, doesn't your father look dapper?
(Laughs)
Here we go.
All right.
Let's get ready.
Are you ready, maddie?
- We're in.
- All right.
Good catch, honey.
You watch me take control of this boat.
I can't believe it.
A Brooklyn Jew on the bayou.
Be careful, Joe.
Don't worry.
I was in the war, don't forget.
Whoa.
It's all right.
I'm okay.
All right, I got my girls with me.
I'm all set to go.
Here we go.
Maddie, listen, I'm going to get you a pair of water skis, all right, for the boat.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Water skis?
- Water skis.
All right, here we go.
I got it.
Whoa.
All right.
Okay.
- It's...
I just...
- (Laughing)
Just take it easy.
I got it.
I got it.
Just... all right.
You know what?
I need a little hand here.
All right, look, you got your chuckle out of the way.
Look, I need a hand up in front, okay?
Okay, maddie, you're fore.
You're aft.
Come on.
Come on.
No, no.
Come on.
Don't you guys know the difference?
I said fore and aft.
- Really.
Come on.
- We're so happy.
Thank you for the boat and the house and everything.
We appreciate it.
All right, honey, sit down.
Let's get going.
I want you to sit down.
We got to get ready.
All right, here we go.
I got it.
All right.
That's it.
I got it.
Natalie:
Maybe everything wasn't different, but it felt like the start of something good.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Joe:
You just watch daddy do it.
Ah, look at that.
(Laughs)
Go ahead.
You can do it.
Ha!
You made it.
Do it again.
You shoot again.
Go ahead.
- Again?
- That's right.
- No, no.
- I go again?
No, put a little more chalk on it.
Try that.
- Okay.
- Yeah, put a little more chalk.
Go ahead.
You can do it, then.
All right.
Go ahead.
You're a pro.
You're going to be a pro.
Let me tell you something.
No, seriously, it didn't go in, but that was a hell of a shot.
(Rock music playing)
Buddy, what do you think?
Do I look Southern to you, buddy?
(Laughs)
Good boy.
Lenny, what are you doing down here?
Hey, how are you?
You weren't supposed to be here for another week.
Let me tell you something.
You better think about staying down here for good, because since I came down here, yeah, I got to tell you, Lenny,
I am having the time of my life.
What's the matter?
Joe, I got some news.
What news?
Crawley backed out of the deal.
What are you talking about?
He just decided it was taking too big a risk with the overseas competition being what it is.
Yeah, all right.
So just get him on the phone.
I'll talk him into it.
Ah, nah, nah.
He's on a plane to London.
He's out of the country, out of the deal.
I'll sue the bastard.
Business is dying, Joe.
We did nothing wrong.
We just got to accept what's happening here.
No, no, no.
I did everything you told me to do before crawley ever entered the equation.
Okay?
I cut distribution.
I moved my whole goddamn plant down South.
I uprooted my family, for Christ sakes.
You told me that's all I needed to do to keep us going.
Things deteriorated faster than we could have imagined.
30 years I've been in this goddamn game, and I gotta deal with this crap?
You put the house in Stella's name?
The insurance I talked about?
We declare bankruptcy, anything in your name is at risk.
They go after you personally, Joe.
It was a good run, Joe.
I mean, they can't take that away from us.
Well, excuse me if I don't share your sentimentality.
I already called shuster.
I said it looked like we'd be taking their offer.
It's a decent offer, Joe.
What?
What, to buy us out as a tax deduction?
Pennies on the dollar?
We still got kimball out in D.C. lobbying for us.
He gets the Southern tax incentive, that's it.
We got it made, then.
Come on.
But we can't count on that, Joe.
Besides, we got a bird in the hand with shuster.
Forget shuster.
We got to keep our eye on the ball here, Lenny.
We step it up with kimball.
We get the media involved, see if we get a few more lobbyists to jump on the bandwagon.
Because once this thing passes, Lenny, we are the only game in town.
You see how easy it is to come up with the negatives?
Huh?
You see that?
Solutions, my friend.
Yeah.
Come on now.
Solutions.
That's what I'm looking for now, Lenny.
All right, pal.
All right.
(Telephone dial clicking)
(Line rings)
- Man:
Hello.
- Hey, Bobby.
Yeah, it's Joe fine.
No, I'm good.
Good.
How you doing?
Listen, I need a favor.
TV reporter:
With the recession in full force and the jobless rate continuing to escalate along with inflation, president Ford has turned to his advisors for...
Maddie:
Daddy,
I could be starting to like it here.
I made some new friends at school, and I was wondering...
Yeah, I'm just trying to watch this.
Okay, but I just was wondering if maybe this weekend...
I know.
I just can't hear this, all right?
Can we please take a few girls out on the boat on Sunday?
Natalie:
How come we never eat real vegetables, only things from cans?
Joe:
You know what?
It's burnt.
Really, you know I don't like when it's burnt.
I'll get you a can of tuna fish.
No, I don't want no tuna fish.
Get me nothing.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
Even our fish comes in cans.
Dad, I'm just really trying to fit in here.
All right, all right, just what is it you want?
I told you.
I want to take a few girls out on the boat Sunday for a couple of hours.
Maybe it's not such a bad idea.
Well, I'm playing golf on Sunday, okay, so forget it.
You guys both want me to make friends, right?
I don't understand.
We have this boat.
It's the perfect way.
Enough with the boat, okay?
Your father's had a long day.
Mom, he's not even listening to me.
(Snaps) Enough with the goddamn boat!
All right?
I ever talked to my father like that, he'd put a strap to me.
You're ungrateful.
All of you.
(Door closes)
You said it was over, mom.
Joe:
I don't know how much more of this I can stand.
Stella:
Of what?
(Joe speaks indistinctly)
I mean, it's your fault.
You raised them as loudmouthed, spoiled little brats.
Natalie:
Every family has its secrets.
For us, it was my father's rage.
It plagued us our entire lives, and what was worse, my mom would take his side.
It was almost like if she said anything against him, she'd wake up and find herself back in her hiding place in Europe.
Her big job was keeping dad, the monster, in his cave.
(Joe yelling)
I used to dream that I was the reincarnation of Anne Frank.
I mean, what Jewish girl didn't?
How'd she do it, anyway?
In spite of everything she lived through, she still thought people were "good at heart."
(Light clattering)
I'm glad we're all together.
Your father has something he wants to say to you.
Joe?
I know my behavior hasn't been that great lately, and I just want to say that I have...
I've had some work issues, and they've been getting to me, and I apologize.
Okay, daddy.
We get it.
All right.
Ahem.
What is wrong with you?
How can you just forgive him like that?
Joe:
You know, I've been thinking.
What do you say we, like...
You know, we'll go out to dinner tonight.
I'll take you all out to dinner, like, you know, a family, like we used to do.
I vote for Chinese.
I have plans.
Well, just cancel them.
That's easy enough, right?
Maddie, your father is sorry for what he does.
You have to think of it like a sickness.
What if he had cancer?
Mom, he doesn't have cancer.
He is the cancer.
Don't you ever say anything like that again.
No matter what he does, he is still your father.
He's a great man.
Are we even living under the same roof?
He takes care of us.
He protects us.
Joe:
Girls!
So you know what?
Listen, forget what I just said.
Let's have a nice barbecue at the house tonight.
That would be nice.
All right.
Radio:
* you are my candy girl * and you got me wanting you *
* I just can't believe...
Natalie:
Some things never change.
Maddie worked on her tan by the pool waiting for the stud in shining armor to come back.
* ...
Believe the wonder of this feeling too *
* I just can't believe it's true * * ah, sugar...
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?
Natalie:
I sat in the shade working on my poem for the soup contest.
Teacher said make it personal.
Dangerous.
It was very tempting.
* ah, honey * ah, sugar, sugar would any guy ever look at me like that?
* you are my candy... *
my poem sucks.
Oh, I'm sure it's beautiful.
If only I could have been born poverty-stricken or survived a war or overcame some dreaded disease at birth.
Bite your tongue.
I haven't suffered nearly enough to be a really good poet.
Poets don't have to suffer.
Mom, the best writers are tortured alcoholics, and it's not like I drink or anything.
Ah, that's good to know.
(Chuckles)
And what about your sister?
I worry about her.
Are you going to invite the new boyfriend to dinner?
Ah, I haven't thought about that.
Did you see the jumbo cross?
Ah, well, we are open-minded people.
- You are?
- Ah, yeah.
She's not going to marry him.
Well, you'll be glad to know that you're still married to a scratch golfer.
- Where's maddie?
- I don't know.
She's out at the pool with her new boyfriend.
(Chuckles)
Wait.
There's a strange guy in my pool?
(Laughs) He's nice too.
- (Door opens) - (Laughter)
Daddy.
You're home early.
So this is the guy that was in the pool?
His name's Earl.
He was just leaving.
How you doing, sir?
Earl.
Great.
- How you doing, sir?
- He was just leaving.
Hey, Earl.
How you doing?
- Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you too, Earl.
Yeah, it's nice.
Why don't you sit down?
I want to talk to you.
No, no, no.
It's okay, yeah?
- Sit down.
Come on.
- Stella:
Joseph.
It's a little game I like to play.
Come on.
It's all right.
Stay out of this, Stella.
Don't worry about it.
Here.
What's the matter?
You can't take an old man?
- Dad.
- Joseph.
It's all right.
Relax.
Relax, maddie.
Now, I warn you, I do 100 push-ups every day, you know.
He's just playing.
Mind your business now, please, all right?
It's all right.
It's all right.
Now just look in my eyes.
Look me in the eyes.
Ready?
1, 2, 3.
Hey, you will never disrespect my daughter, right?
- Dad!
- Of course not.
You're never going to offend me, right?
- No, sir.
- Say it.
- "I will never..."
- I will never...
"Disrespect..."
- Disrespect...
- Dad!
- Me.
- You.
All right.
That's not bad, but I think the guys in Brooklyn would have put up a better fight.
Are you serious, sir?
I'm so sorry.
Come on.
I'm so sorry.
Joseph.
What?
Why would you do a thing like that to your own daughter?
Huh?
She's finally happy here, and boyfriends are gonna come and go.
Yeah, well, this one better go fast.
You see that earring in his ear?
I mean, come on.
And that cross around his neck?
It's big as my fist.
Come on.
I mean,
I'm protecting her, okay?
I'm protecting her.
Is he always like that?
You don't even want to know.
So I'll see you on Monday?
You bet.
Natalie:
It was the weekend, and I was still stuck on my poem, which I hated more than ever.
Anyone who wanted to be in the contest and win $500 had to submit their first draft the following week.
(Knock on door)
- Maddie.
- Hmm?
Hey, come on.
We're going on a day trip.
- Oh, my God.
- Put on something nice.
You guys sleep half the day away.
Let's go.
Come on.
Natalie:
I was at war with imperfection.
I hated everything I wrote.
It was a war with imperfection.
A tug of war with imperfection.
You know what?
That's not bad.
Natalie, come on.
Let's go.
But I have to present my poem Monday.
Natalie, come on.
All work and no play is not good.
We got to go.
Where do you think he's taking us?
Girls, let's get moving.
Please tell us what's going on.
I'm not going to tell you where we're going, but I'll show you how we're getting there.
Come here.
- (Laughs)
- Joe:
Look at that.
Maddie:
I call shotgun.
Joe:
Is that beautiful or what?
We are going in style.
Where did you get the rolls, dad?
My own driver Sam hooked me up.
Just be ready.
Five minutes.
Come on, let's go.
Evening, Mr. fine.
Hey, thanks for making this night so special, Sam.
Oh, you're welcome, sir.
The girls will be down in a minute.
Okay.
(Gasps) It's so amazing.
This is so exciting.
Ah.
Ladies, meet Sam.
Evening, ladies.
- Hey.
- Where are we going?
Well, let's put it this way.
The guy's a musical legend.
When he sings, the girls go crazy, and he dances up a storm.
(Girls gasp)
Natalie:
I can't believe it.
I've been waiting forever to see him.
Maddie:
Oh, my gosh.
Could you contain yourself?
Maddie, I can't believe we're going to see him.
- Woman:
I'm so excited.
- I know.
It's amazing.
Natalie:
I am so excited.
All right.
Sam, why don't you come inside to see the show?
That's a pretty exclusive club, sir.
Listen, you're a negro.
I'm a Jew.
It's not like they're going to be happy to see either one of us.
It's about time us bottom-feeders move up the food chain.
Come on.
This is going to be a night you'll never forget.
That's what I'm afraid of.
(Both laugh)
Man:
What's taking them so long?
(Laughter)
Look at the line.
Poor bastards probably been here all night.
Follow me.
Joe fine, party of four, with a guest.
Oh, Mr. fine.
Pleasure to meet you.
You're on our v.I.P. List.
- Right this way, sir.
- V.I.P. List?
(Laughter)
I'm telling you this is going to be some show.
Look at this.
Is this place something or what?
Sam:
This is something else.
Your private box, Mr. fine.
All right.
Look at this.
Wow.
Dad!
- Oh, my gosh.
- All right.
Whoa.
This is the good life.
Joe:
Can't get better seats than this.
They're never going to forget this.
You know what, honey?
Why don't you order a couple of Martinis and get the girls some Shirley temples?
And, Sam, you get something too, okay?
Okay, thank you, sir.
- Where are you going?
- I got a meeting to go to.
I'll be back before the main event.
- Don't worry.
- A meeting with who?
Sam, you take care of the girls, all right?
Sure thing, Mr. fine.
(Knocking on door)
I'm here to see Bobby.
Hey, is this really a body shop, or is this just your cover here?
I got a Cadillac, you know, could use a little tlc.
Maybe you guys could look at it sometime.
Hey, hey, hey, Joe fine.
Glad you could make it.
Hey, Bob.
How are you?
Doesn't say much, does he?
He's got other qualities.
Follow me.
Yeah.
I bet.
(Chuckles)
(Audience murmuring)
(Audience cheering)
Where's dad?
The show is about to start.
Something's wrong.
Nothing is wrong, damn it.
Why don't I go out and take a look around for him?
Oh, no, no, just sit down.
Sit down.
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen, the roxy is proud to present the king of rock 'n' roll!
(Cheering)
- (Dice rattle)
- Let's go.
Let's go.
You got them tickets I sent you, right?
Yeah.
You really came through for me big time, Bobby.
The kids are in heaven.
Well, that's a good thing, right?
Okay, have a seat right here, Joe.
I'm going to see if the big guy is ready for you.
Take care of my boy.
You give him anything he wants.
I'm buying.
Give me a scotch, neat.
* oh, my God * can you see * that I've got a chick that's into me?
* * she wanna do it * yeah * she wanna do it, uh-huh * she wanna do it... (Overlapping conversations)
Bobby:
Hey, Joe.
Battelli is ready to see you now.
Thanks for making the introduction, Bobby.
I'm always here for you.
You know that.
All right.
No sense in wasting a good drink.
* she was a real wild child * * she wanted to do it, yeah * * she wanted to do it, oh, yeah * * she wanted to do it * do it night and day.
Natalie:
My dad missed the whole show.
Where the hell was he?
- Oh, thank God.
- Hey.
Natalie:
He took so long that I finished my poem and fell asleep.
Where are the kids?
They're up?
We were worried sick.
You missed him, daddy.
He was fatter than I thought he'd be.
(Laughs) Listen, Sam, thanks for taking care of the girls, all right?
Why don't you go get the car, pull it out in front?
- Sure thing.
- All right.
What were you doing?
What was I doing?
This is what I was doing, right here.
Where did you get that?
Never mind where I got it.
The night is young.
Come on, let's go party more.
Come on, let's go.
(Laughs)
All right, come on, girls.
Here we go.
Natalie:
It wasn't until later that I realized we'd been bought off.
(Chuckles)
I haven't seen you this happy in such a long time.
Ah, what's there not to be happy about, right?
New home, new life.
It's great.
You know, I got something for you.
Oh, no.
What more could you get me?
No.
I got something for you.
I didn't get a chance to buy you an engagement ring when we first got married.
Mm, you got me one a few years later.
But it... that was not even a carat.
Come on, baby.
That was like a token.
- Here.
- Oh, no, Joseph.
This is an engagement ring.
Here.
Give me...
Oh, my God.
It's huge.
(Both laugh)
Oh, God.
Are you sure we can afford this?
Of course we can afford it.
I worked my whole life for this, okay?
(Laughs)
You let me do this for you, okay?
I love you, Stella.
- I love you.
- You hear me?
I love you.
Hey.
Hey, hey, get over here.
- Come here.
- How are you?
What's the news?
You fly me down here on a Saturday, it must be something pretty big.
Oh, this is big.
Something to celebrate.
Cubans, your favorite.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
You going to tell me what we're celebrating?
Let's take a walk.
What would you say if I told you that we have enough money to keep us solvent for the next eight months?
I'd ask you what bank you robbed.
I got a loan.
- A bank loan?
- "Bank loan." Come on.
Had a 10-year relationship with Manny hanning.
The first sign of trouble, they stop returning my calls.
(Scoffs)
So where'd you get the loan, Joe?
I got it.
Who are these guys?
Is it a mob loan?
(Chuckles)
Ah, Jesus, Joe.
We always steered clear of those ganefs.
Besides, we got a decent offer from shuster.
The guy's chomping at the bit.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't embarrass me with his lowball offer, okay?
You're playing with fire, Joe.
Look, plans are coming together down in D.C.
Come on.
As soon as the legislation votes on the Southern tax trade, we're home free.
And what if it doesn't?
Come on.
You think I got where I have without taking some prudent risks?
Prudent?
We've both seen what those people could do.
You forgot Bernie weinstein, that poor bastard, huh?
They broke his legs for a deuce.
The guy still walks around with a limp.
Weinstein was a smug son of a bitch.
I don't know anybody who wasn't happy the day he got his legs broke, okay?
Joe, listen to me.
30 years you kept a roof over my family's head, what we ate.
You educated my people.
I tell you this with all due respect.
I think you're kidding yourself.
I'm kidding myself?
If I don't tell you, who would?
You know what, Lenny?
You're right.
20 years, I been carrying you on my back.
You always been a taker and, right now, a little bit of a coward.
Ah...
Look, I know you don't mean that.
Look, we both got a family, Joe.
Think of your girls.
I'm doing it for my girls, you horse's ass!
Joe, listen to me.
No, you listen to me.
You know what?
Just get the fuck out.
Really.
Just get the fuck out before I do something I don't want to do.
Natalie:
When it rains, it really pours in Louisiana.
After buddy's back legs gave out...
Don't worry, buddy.
This is like the best vet in the whole South.
I insisted my parents take him to a specialist.
(Thunder rumbling)
All right, well...
How much time do I got before he can't even walk again?
You know, give me a ballpark figure.
There really is no way to tell for sure.
Well, what are the options?
Well, he is suffering and in some pain.
We could put him down now, or you could take him home and I could give him something.
But either way, I suggest you think about it.
(Buddy whimpers)
Well, I thought about it.
I think we should put him down.
Daddy, please!
You think he wants to be remembered like this, huh?
Sick?
No, you can't!
Mom?
!
Let's just think about it.
We don't have to decide today.
Look, could you just back me up sometimes so I don't have to be the bad guy all the time?
Just give us a minute to say goodbye, doc, all right?
No.
Please, daddy.
Please.
It's for his own damn good.
And what about maddie?
She won't even get a chance to say goodbye.
No, you can't.
You can't do this.
I won't let you.
No.
Stop the hysteria, or I'm going to tell you to wait in the fucking car.
(Sobbing)
You had to see him.
He would never have been able to bring buddy back.
We had to do it then.
Bullshit.
He does what he wants.
He doesn't care what anybody else thinks.
Why are you lying for him, Natalie?
Tell me the truth.
I'm your sister.
I tried to stop him, but you know how nuts he gets, and I'm not as brave as you are.
Natalie:
When I finally had to present my poem,
I couldn't do it.
What had seemed like genius to me was now gibberish.
Natalie?
I hated myself.
I hated him.
I hated anyone who ever dared to rhyme.
I can't.
Natalie:
My mom would say,
"time heals all wounds."
She taught us to believe in any rosy cliche where we could fill in the blanks.
In this case, time meant the two-week period leading up to maddie's birthday.
(Shutter clicks)
Happy Birthday!
- Stella:
Happy Birthday!
- All right.
Are you ready for your present?
Yeah.
Happy Birthday.
No, it's yours.
(Squeals) Oh, my gosh!
It's all yours, honey.
You deserve it.
Daddy, thank you so much.
Mama, thank you.
Only the best for my girl.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, all right, here's the lights right here.
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.
You watching?
- I'm watching.
- Okay.
All right.
All right.
Here's the air.
- Okay.
- You got to just move that.
And here's the eight-track, but, please, no music while you're driving, okay?
- Okay, daddy.
- All right.
All right, here we go.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- (Engine grinds)
- Start it?
- Yes.
Go ahead.
- (Engine starts)
That's it.
Good.
Good.
Very good.
Just go straight.
You like this car, huh?
- I love it.
- All right.
Just keep going straight.
That's it.
Okay.
All right, easy, easy, easy on the gas.
Okay, daddy.
I passed my driver's test, you know.
Yes, I know.
That doesn't make you a driver, bud, okay?
All right, you got to take it easy now.
All right.
All right, slow...
All right, we're going to... whoa.
Just... easy!
(Tires squeal)
What are you doing?
I-I'm sorry.
I know, but what are you doing?
I'm sorry, dad.
- All right, you're sorry.
- Joe, please.
Sorry's not good enough.
Can we just go home?
You got to be careful.
People can get hurt here.
- I know.
- All right.
- (Tires squeal)
- All right, listen to me.
What are you doing?
- Stella:
Joe.
Joseph.
- Huh?
!
Dad, you know what?
I don't even want your car.
Wait a minute!
Quitter.
What?
You're a quitter and an ingrate.
Asshole.
What'd you just call me?
I called you a fucking asshole.
(Stella screams)
Joseph!
(Screams)
Stella:
My God.
Natalie:
Maddie!
Maddie.
Maddie, are you okay?
Stella:
Maddie.
Maddie!
(Sobbing)
I'm fine.
Stop it.
(Engine roars)
(Door closes)
(Door opens)
You need to see someone.
I'm not talking to no headshrinker.
Are you crazy?
There are people that can help you with this.
You know, just the doctors.
No, no doctors.
What am I going to say to a doctor?
Come on.
I want to talk to someone, I talk to you.
Talk to me.
Talk to me.
I talk to you.
Remember I told you that I got this scar because I fell and I hit a glass table?
Well, that was like half the truth.
I was 15, Stella, 15 years old.
I was a young man.
I had a toothache, you know.
It was really bad.
I kept telling my father to take me to the dentist, and he said, "hey, tough it out.
Be a man."
"It's good for you."
So I tried, you know.
One night, I couldn't take the pain anymore.
So I guess I asked him too many times to take me.
He turned around.
He punched me in the face, knocked me out.
I fell into the glass table.
40 stitches later,
I woke up in the hospital, you know.
I felt all right, you know?
I got my tooth fixed.
That's how I got this scar, Stella.
That's the truth.
It's a beautiful scar.
(Laughs) Yeah, it's beautiful.
I don't mind it.
'Cause every time I look in the mirror, it makes me realize how much I fucking hate him.
He got his wish.
He made me tough, all right.
I'm going to make you an appointment with Dr. tessler.
Baby, I don't know.
Yes, he is a good man.
You can talk to him.
He can help you, Joseph.
I don't know.
Please.
Please, I'm begging you.
Do it for me.
I love you so much.
Please, Joseph.
Please.
All right.
Thank you.
Natalie:
So we took a trip to Baton Rouge to see my dad's old doctor, who had semiretired there three years earlier.
Finally dad was going to get some help.
This is the moment we had been praying for.
Don't we get input with Dr. tessler?
We thought we'd get to talk to him a little.
I told you I talked to the doctor.
All right.
Pressure is normal.
All right.
So Stella tells me that you're under quite a bit of stress.
She sounded very concerned.
Yeah, well, Stella overreacts about everything, doc.
Oh, to me, she sounded like she was a concerned wife.
Well...
You know, there are medications for this sort of a thing.
No.
Doc, I'm not taking no medication.
I'm fine.
You know, I mean, she's very, like, anxious, nervous.
You know what I mean.
- I mean...
- Really?
Yeah.
One time, I had heartburn, you know.
She thought I was having a heart attack.
She called 911.
Really?
I didn't know she was that anxious.
Ah, that's my wife, doc.
So you think that this...
Fear she has about your anger is just an exaggeration?
Absolutely.
I mean, look, am I...
I get angry sometimes?
Do I got a temper?
Yeah, but no different than any other guy who's got, like, you know, stress at work.
I mean, she overreacts, doc.
I mean, you know she was a holocaust survivor, right?
Yeah, I know that.
Yeah.
Well, this woman went through a lot.
I'm telling you.
I mean, she...
You know, Christian friends of her family, they hid her in a hole in the ground during the day for two years.
That's incredible.
You're telling me, doc.
So do you think this is what this is all about?
Oh, absolutely, doc.
I mean, you don't understand.
I'm her whole world.
When I met her, she couldn't even speak a word of English.
She had nothing.
I mean, you know,
I gave her a life that's like a fairytale land.
I'm fine, doc, really.
Right?
I'm fine, right?
Come on.
(Both chuckle)
Dr. tessler:
Stella, girls, you'll be happy to hear that Joe is as healthy as a man half his age, fit as a fiddle, no sign of depression or anything else that concerns me.
That's wonderful.
What'd I tell you?
- Joe:
Thanks, doc.
- You're welcome.
Joe:
You guys ready?
- Natalie:
Doctor was wrong.
- Let's go.
Everything was not fine.
My father had so many plates spinning in the air that one of them was bound to crash.
It was the law of gravity.
Right.
Oh, kimball.
Kimball, listen to me, all right?
Are you telling me there's not a chance that this legislation's going to pass now?
What?
With all your political muscle, you can't get a bill passed that's a fucking win-win for this country?
Do they know how many jobs they're flushing down the toilet here?
If all the manufacturing goes overseas, we're going to have nothing left here.
Forget it.
Forget it.
(Handset rings)
Where are you going?
I got to take care of something at work.
Don't wait up for me, all right?
Joe:
I don't know what I'm going to do.
That legislation was going to save my ass.
I'm out of options.
You think I want to burn my factory down?
You know what we call that?
No offense... we call it "Jewish lightning."
You know, excuse the expression.
I got just the guy for you.
I just don't want anybody getting hurt.
Ah, nobody's going to get hurt.
Boy's a pro, tops in his field.
(Balls clatter)
Do it.
(Balls clatter)
Joe:
Hey, pumpkin.
I was looking through my files, and I found these photos.
You have to see them.
Dad, I'm working on my poem.
Oh, come on.
You work too hard.
Take a break, huh?
No, you have to see this.
This is your mother, your mother when we were dating.
Will you look at this?
Come here.
Look at that.
Come here.
Sit down.
That's your mom.
Whoa.
She looks amazing.
Yeah, she does.
Most beautiful woman I ever met.
That's all right, huh?
Look at her.
Look at this one.
That's your grandmother, my mom.
You look a little like her.
Do you have any pictures of grandpa?
No.
No, I had some.
I don't know what happened to 'em.
Hey, you know what?
I forgot why I came in here in the first place.
Here.
Now I want you to take this, and I want you to put it in a safe place, all right?
What is it?
It's information.
What kind of information?
Well, you know, if something ever happens to me, you know, you and your sister got to take care of your mom.
You're both old enough now to understand.
There's, like, vault combinations, insurance policies, where the money is.
Listen.
Hey, things happen in life, okay?
Just put it in a safe spot, all right?
This is too weird.
(Laughs)
I'll put it in here.
Let me tell you something, and I'm not telling you this because I'm your father.
You are remarkable.
(Laughs) Thanks, daddy.
You know, I think this is the first time that we've ever talked like this, me and you.
You're kidding.
Come here.
Man:
Hello?
Lenny.
Yeah, hi.
It's Joe.
Joe, it's been on my mind...
Yeah.
I know.
Hey, listen, we both got crazy, right?
It's all right.
Forget it.
Look, I was wondering if you could still do me a favor.
What do you need, Joe?
Yeah, well, could you call shuster?
And if it's still available,
I'd like to take his offer.
Tell him we can make a deal here, all right?
Well, sure.
Absolutely.
Joey, look...
Forget it.
Come on.
We both got nuts.
It's...
Come on. 30 years we're together.
What are we going to do, throw it away?
- Ah, never us, Joe.
- All right.
All right, thanks.
Radio:
* hey, hey * all right * get it from the main line * * all right
* I said a-find it, find it * * darling, love it * if you like it * yeah * hey, hey * it's your business...
Come on, man.
Let's get this party started, huh?
Whoo!
* get it together, baby
- * come and get your love...
- Whoo!
- (Laughter)
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God.
Boy:
Louie!
Louie!
- * come and get your love...
- Louie!
Maddie:
Who invited them?
* come and get your love... * excuse me.
(Laughs)
- (Whistling)
- Whoo-hoo!
Girl:
Go, guys.
(Laughter, whistling)
Get out of my pool!
Come on.
We're just having fun.
Get out of my pool.
- Welcome to the party.
- Get out of my pool now!
Get out!
(Car approaches)
(Car door closes)
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.
Ah, I thought you were working late.
You all right?
Yeah, no, I had one of those days, you know?
I just wanted to come home to see you and the kids, you know?
Where are the girls?
They're in back at the pool.
Maddie's got some friends over.
- Really?
- Yeah.
How many friends?
Ah, just a few nice kids.
- Mom!
- What's going on?
Oh, they're just having fun.
Yeah.
Except, I think, maybe one of them forgot their bathing suit.
Somebody's in my pool with no clothes on?
Um...
Just wait there.
Just don't...
- Son of a bitch.
- Joe, they're just kids.
- Kids got no respect.
- Joseph, listen.
- Natalie:
Mom?
- What are you doing?
- Never mind.
- What is it?
No, what are you do...
- Oh, my God.
No, Joe.
- Dad!
Listen, I'm only going to scare them.
Just relax.
Everybody relax.
He's not going to shoot them, is he?
- Just relax, okay!
- Mom?
Oh, my God.
No.
* baby, hey, oh * hey, all right * get it from the main vine... * all right!
I'm going to say this once and only once!
Jesus Christ.
Your dad's fricking crazy!
I want you to pick up your things, put on your clothes, and get off my property now, or I'm going to start shooting!
- Daddy!
- One!
- Two!
- Jesus Christ.
- Three!
- He's not gonna shoot anybody.
- Four!
- Get out of here, Louie!
- Five!
- Leave!
- Oh, shit.
- Six!
- Get out of here, Louie!
- Leave!
- Seven!
- Just go!
- Eight!
- Get out!
- Nine!
- Earl:
Holy jeez.
- You crazy kike!
- Get out!
- 10!
- Louie!
Earl:
Get out of here!
(Kids screaming)
- Move!
- (Gunshot)
- He has a gun, maddie.
- Just go, please.
That's right!
Run!
Run, you son of a bitches!
- Dad!
- Maddie.
Boy:
I can't believe that.
Shoot me!
Shoot me.
You've ruined my life!
You might as well shoot me!
What the hell are you talking about?
You threatened all of my new friends with a gun, dad!
You're sick.
(Sobs)
You need help, dad.
(Maddie sobbing)
They just said there's going to be a storm tonight.
Isn't it hurricane season?
Maybe you should just hold off on all this till tomorrow.
(Car radio playing rock music) * the sound of your footsteps... * it's too late for that.
He's here.
Come with me.
* your soft, gentle motion, baby... *
- come with me.
- I can't.
* in my midnight confession * * when I tell all the world that I love you * * in my midnight confession * * when I say all the things that I want to... *
- hey.
- Hi.
Natalie:
Maddie had somewhere to go.
She was smarter than I thought.
In fact, she was a lot smarter than me, 'cause I didn't have an escape plan.
I was stuck.
(Line rings)
- Yeah?
- Bobby.
- Yeah, it's Joe fine.
- Hey, Joe.
Yeah, no.
I'm good.
I'm good.
How you doing?
Yeah.
Listen, that thing we talked about...
You know, about hiring that kid?
- Jewish lightning.
- Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Yeah, the Jewish lightning.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Forget it.
Cancel the whole thing.
What?
No, let's just say
I had a moment of clarity, all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, on my end, battelli...
What about battelli?
Listen, you tell him I'm a man of my word.
All right, he's going to get paid.
Bobby, you think that scares me?
You have no idea right now.
You think that scares me, Bobby?
Huh?
You tell him to do what he's got to do.
I'll put him in my goddamn will, all right?
!
(Handset slams)
I was thinking maybe this weekend we could picnic over by the lake or, you know, out by...
Sounds fun.
Hey, man.
What the hell you doing?
Sorry, bro.
This your car?
Yes.
What the hell you doing sitting on it?
Hey, look, I wasn't sitting.
I was leaning.
You was leaning?
Don't get smart with me, boy.
- I don't want no trouble.
- He didn't do anything.
He was thinking about stealing it, wasn't you, you fucking nigger?
Stop it!
He didn't do anything.
- Maddie!
- Stop!
Maddie, look, down here, women don't tell men what to do, okay?
Maddie.
Maddie!
Maddie, where are you going?
Don't touch me.
Where are you going?
!
I want to help you.
But I'm scared of you.
(Laughs)
You're not scared of me.
You love me.
Come on, Stella.
- Come here.
- No more.
No.
Natalie:
What's going on?
Just let me talk to your father.
Tell her to go away, all right?
Just tell her...
Let's go upstairs.
Let's go upstairs, baby.
Come on.
I want to go upstairs.
Just listen to me.
Listen.
Now you go over there, and you tell them to get the fuck upstairs.
You hear me?
- Get 'em out of here.
- Don't you see what you're doing to your children?
Tell them to get the fuck out of here!
Don't you touch her!
(Thunder rumbling)
Do you know what's going on here?
Everything's turning to shit!
When are you going to get it through your thick skulls that I hate my fucking life?
(Insects chirping)
(Gunshot pops)
- (Women screaming)
- Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Daddy!
- Dad!
(Sobbing)
(Dog barking)
Are you okay?
I hate you.
Why don't you try to stop him?
Does someone in this family
(sobbing) Have to kill themselves before you can finally see what's been going on here?
Because the truth is, I've thought about it, mama.
(Alarm, sirens blaring)
What's going on?
Who turned on the alarm?
I did.
- By accident?
- No, not an accident.
We're in trouble.
What the hell are you talking about?
- What's happening?
- What's going on?
What the hell is the matter with you, Stella?
You call the cops right now, and you tell them it was a mistake.
No, it's not a mistake.
Everybody, get upstairs.
It's fine, okay?
It's okay.
(Police siren wailing)
(Radio dispatch chatter)
What the hell is wrong with you?
(Police bang on door)
Please, come in.
He's terrorizing us.
It's my husband.
He's got a gun.
- He tried to kill himself.
- Sir.
Sir.
- No, no, no.
- Calm down.
- It was a mistake.
- Calm down, sir.
- Officer, no, no.
- Just calm down.
It was a mistake.
Are you listening to what I'm saying?
- Calm down.
- It was a mistake.
- What are you doing?
- Natalie:
No.
Don't cuff me, not in front of my kids.
Stella, would you tell them this is my house?
Stella, tell 'em!
No, Joe.
It's my house.
(Siren continues)
- (Sobbing)
- It's okay.
Okay.
(Siren, alarm fade)
Natalie:
My mother never spoke to us about what she had done.
But incredibly, she had done it.
And our home was quiet.
It was more than quiet.
It was peaceful.
Look what came in the mail today.
It's the poetry contest people.
What?
How is that even possible?
I was disqualified.
You open it.
Oh, my God.
You're a finalist.
What?
Really?
I am?
(Laughs)
This is unbelievable.
I'm so proud of you.
Natalie:
We were finally ready to slow down... stop running.
This is so exciting.
I'm betting on Natalie to win.
But you'll still love me even if I place?
Oh, even if you show and throw up on the judge...
Judge:
It gives me great pleasure to announce the first-place winner of the sixth annual Louisiana state.
Campbell's soup poetry competition,
Natalie Elizabeth fine.
(Applause, cheering)
You can do it.
Congratulations, Natalie.
Here's the $500 prize money.
Natalie, would you do us the honor of reading your poem, "mighty fine"?
Go ahead.
"Little boy's devil..."
now devil's man.
Still running from where he ran.
Still hiding when he can.
Though my parents once said that the monster was dead, there's been a recent resurrection.
A blister on sanity's bright complexion.
A tug of war with imperfection in this temple of emotion, where he stirred so much commotion.
There's a monster in dad, and it makes him wicked mad.
Is there a cure in dad's devotion... or in a child's whispered pleas?
Tame the monster in dad, take his fits, all that's bad...
"and save one mighty fine family."
(Applause)
Natalie:
That's the way I wish it had been.
My dad never made it to the contest, but he finally got some help.
And his hospital stay saved all of our lives.
As his anger faded, my courage grew, and we met up somewhere in the middle.
Okay, so I wasn't Anne Frank.
But I was me, and that was enough.
Eventually we found each other again... and that was enough.

Excuse me!
Out of the way, please!
- Hey!
- Chill out, mamacita!
What's with the weekday vibe?
It is a Tuesday, sir.
Hey, hey, you work on that show?
Yeah, I work on that show.
Just like your mom works that street corner --
I'm sorry, it's too much.
No sweat.
My mom is a prostitute.
Hey, this chick knows Jenna Maroney!
Hey, new drinking game!
Drink when someone says something!
Who are you, people?
!
We're Crabcatchers!
You know, from Jenna's song "Catchin' Crabs in Paradise".
J' I caught crabs in paradise J'
J' And yes I mean both kinds of crabs J'
Ugh!
I thought that was at least gonna be innuendo.
Jenna's playing on "Today" show in a couple of days, so we're just camping out and unwindulaxing.
Wait!
So Jenna's Jimmy Buffett ripoff is actually a thing?
See?
You people from New York don't know all the stuff that's going on in the rest of the country.
Truck races.
Swamp parties.
Mall fires.
I can't believe she's pulling this off.
And I can't believe I'm pulling this off!
Why do you have a tattoo of a seat belt?
So I don't get pulled over when I'm driving shirtless!
You wanted to see me?
Have I mentioned Marisol, the Mexican sideline reporter I've been seeing?
Well, since our weekend in Aspen, she's been put on pelvic rest --
Fast-forward noise!
Marisol was supposed to attend a fundraiser luncheon with me today.
It's ten thousand dollars a plate, and I'll have to eat the ticket unless --
Unless I eat the ticket.
Fancy luncheon.
Seafood bar.
I'm thinking 75 cents a shrimp over three hours.
Carry three .75 times --
By the time I'm done, you'll be making money.
Good.
But I should warn you, though, this is a Republican fundraiser.
So if you're coming, it won't be as Liz Lemon,
Huff Po superuser and gun control lunatic.
You'll come as Liz Lemon, my chum.
"Chum"?
Okay, I like that.
And you'll be able to keep your opinions to yourself?
Oh, good Lord, Lemon, you just locked your mouth and then swallowed the key.
It makes no earthly sense!
Shrimp!
Jenna's crab idiots won't shut up!
Why couldn't she have died when that rabid dog bit her?
Oh, it wasn't rabid.
I just said that so they'd have to put it down.
And then I'd be the star of that dog food commercial!
I had to walk an extra block to get around your stupid Crabcatchers.
My doctors have been very clear about this, Jenna.
If I get moderate exercise, I'm gonna die!
And I'm mad at your success, but I'm pretending it's something else!
Okay, speaking of me, how many Crabcatchers Fiesta Crab Hats would each of you like to buy at the unbelievable price of $49.95?
Please!
I've had a crab on my head for free!
I'm lying.
The claws hold your cigarette while you uncork a brew-skye --
"Uncork a brew-skye"?
Yeah.
You know --
Ka-zap!
Blinky-blinky-blinky-blinky --
Those aren't even the right noises!
Everyone knows you hate stuff like this.
You're maybe the most high-maintenance bitch in Hollywood!
"Maybe"?
Who's more?
Who is she?
Okay.
Cut this crap out and get those sunburned d-bags out of the Plaza!
Hey, no can will, Pete.
But have an unwindulaxing day!
You medical office before pictures!
I've never even seen a crab.
I'm sorry.
I don't need some Kenyan-born college professor telling me I didn't build my company.
Because I earned my trust fund by always being polite to Grandfather.
Now, Donaghy!
Still over at NBC with all those communists and homosexuals?
Reginald, I believe you're thinking of the White House.
But not for long.
In two weeks, we take this country back.
And no bureaucrat can force me to subsidize female promiscuity in the name of healthcare.
You okay, chum?
Michelle Obama's on steroids.
And this is Studio 6H.
Home to "TGS" stars, Tracy Jordan, Jenna Maroney...
Oh, my God!
It's Jenna!
Visor Lady, get a picture of me!
What do I--?
Press the button?
No, it's different from every other camera in the world!
God, I can't escape you, people!
Whoa!
Chill out, brother!
It's beer o'clock somewhere!
You're a fraud!
And you look like a condom that's been dropped on the floor of a barbershop!
Are you all unwindulaxing?
This guy looks like he could use a little latitude adjustment.
Rude!
Will you sign my Caesarean scar --?
Oh!
Ahh!
You moron!
Hey, it's just a party foul.
Exactly.
That's why I said, "You!
More on."
Like "pour more on me"!
Oh, my God.
She can't be herself in front of these losers.
She has to be "Island Jenna".
Which means...
- We can mess with --
- We should go to a pumpkin patch?
Pranksmen, activate.
Obama's bailout would never have worked if big business hadn't heroically taken it.
But where's our parade?
- That's idiotic!
- Lemon!
No, sir!
You don't have enough shrimp to buy my silence!
Also you're out of shrimp!
You know better, Jack.
You all know better.
Except maybe the really inbred WASPs.
You thank for mention Gordeau!
Sure.
You're hypocrites.
You believe in the death penalty, but it's okay to kill animals for food?
I don't know where I'm going with this yet.
Hang on, hang on!
My boyfriend and I aren't married, but we might have a baby together anyway.
And I hope it's gay -- Male gay!
Because if it's a lady, it's too much hiking.
But homosexuality is unnatural, right?
Then why are there gay dolphins, people?
You heard me.
They make love to their husbands' blowholes.
Let's see that in some science textbooks!
Oh, that's right.
The whole Texas Board of Education thing that I don't fully remember.
Teachers should get paid a million dollars a year!
If birth control pills fixed boners, you would get them free with your driver's license!
And how do we know that God isn't a tree?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Elizabeth Lemon.
And this is what we're up against.
Four more years of a president chosen by people like her.
She has an iPad subscription to The New Yorker.
She vehemently opposes the ivory trade despite the jobs it creates.
And in her apartment there was a black-and-white photograph where you can almost see a breast.
It's an original Leonard Nimoy!
If we do not defeat Obama, people like my little friend here will destroy this country.
So add a zero to whatever you were planning to give.
For Romney, for America, for anyone but her.
What the hell, Jack?
I thought you said I was your chum!
You are my chum.
The bait I throw in the water to attract the big fish.
Dammit!
Second meaning!
Hey...
Yeah.
Whoa!
What are you douche-compadres doing here?
Well, Jenna, everyone knows how you're always so chill.
So, of course, you won't freak out when you see that Cerie's wearing that exact same shirt.
As a dress.
The belt is a baby's necktie!
Also, I found a bunch of your pre-nosejob headshots.
You'll sign them so I can sell them online, right?
Of course.
'Cause who cares what you look like?
All that counts is what's inside your blender.
I'm glad you feel that way.
'Cause I've always wanted to give you a haircut!
Yeah!
You virgins have no idea who you're messing with --
Whoa, Jenna, unwindulax.
Oh, I'm not just Jenna anymore.
I'm a god to those Crabcatchers.
And they will do whatever I say.
So what?
I'll tell you "so what".
For one thing, if you cross me or my army, you will never set foot in Florida again.
Because that's our capital.
But I'm judging Spike TV's
"Miss Nude Divorcée" in Tampa on Christmas Eve!
Oh...
And I was gonna visit MGM Studios.
The rides there capture the thrills and chills of the movies!
And it doesn't end there.
Because my people are everywhere.
If you ever want to pick your ball color at a putt-putt course, or have your alligator euthanized humanely, or fly on Delta, you will back off.
Or the Crabcatchers will come for you.
Just as soon as it's cool for them to drive.
It's a gray hoodie.
It says "Who Farted?" on the back.
It's got a bunch of tampons in the pocket!
I don't know what else to tell you.
Lemon, there you are.
Did your girlfriend even cancel or was that more Karl Rove trickery?
I'm sorry, but I needed you to come, Lemon.
This luncheon is a fundraiser for my personal Super PAC,
"Americans for an American America".
I needed to unite the room around a common enemy, and Ed Begley, Jr. wasn't available because the sail on his car broke.
See, this is why 50.1% of Americans hate Republicans.
Because you're sneaky and cynical.
Cynical?
I think I'm the very opposite of cynical.
I'm doing everything I can for my beliefs.
And I truly believe that one rich person can make a difference in this country.
And a room full of rich people can change the world.
Well, I also believe that one person can make a difference.
With ideas.
Oh!
That really is wonderful.
Harold, you have to hear this.
Lemon, say that again.
Ideas are more powerful than money.
So what are you gonna do with all this money, Jack?
Buy ad time?
'Cause I'm already on TV every night, with a little something called "TGS".
And we just got nominated for a Stage Managers' Guild Award.
So you may have millions of dollars, sir, but America's will hear my two cents!
That's not what people want, Lemon, least of all from their televisions.
They want their "Honeys Boo Boo" and their Sunday Night Feetball, which is the plural of "football".
Americans don't want to think.
That's why they need men like me to pick their presidents for them.
Wow.
Okay.
So I guess it's my words versus your money.
And we'll see who can really make a difference in this election.
It's on, Donaghy.
May the best gender non-specific person win.
Just leave the amount blank, Harold.
Those are tampons.
Deal with it.
For God's sake, some of us have jobs!
I've got a pile of 1020Gs up here with no travel times on them!
And if I don't --!
Oh!
Aah!
Listen up, nerds!
Tonight, "TGS" is about to get real.
We've got 38 minutes of air-time, an hour if the bowling tournament ends early, and we're gonna use it to get the message out there.
I don't know, I think we've been hitting Romney pretty hard.
I guess that's why they call me "Mitt".
"Baseball Mitt Romney" and "Barack, A Llama" aren't saying anything!
I want to make a difference.
We've got to do something big.
Something that will go viral, like that otter that looked just like Tracy.
Look, we've got the greatest resource in the world at our fingertips -- American celebrity.
We get some hot young actor --
Oh, my grand-nephew Kellan Lutz from "Twilight" is visiting me.
He's in my office.
I have tolerated your pathological lying for six years.
If you speak again, I will kill you.
Great uncle?
Mama's baby is out of marshmallows.
Sweet grand-nephew, I've been warming more marshmallows for you in the pocket of my dungarees.
Okay.
Good job, Lutz.
Gentlemen!
Token silent lady...
We have to spend all of our wonderful money and help my hair-mentor, Mitt Romney, become the eleventh legitimate president of the United States.
Garrett, what does the campaign need?
Well, as you know, with PACs like this, we're not allowed to have direct contact with candidates.
I'm kidding.
I'm Garrett Romney.
Mitt's my dad.
But here's the thing, Jack.
My Brother-Dad, which is Mormon for "Dad", has more money than he knows what to do with.
With all due respect, Garrett, I don't think that's a thing.
Well, it's just, at this point in the campaign, for us it's more about ideas than cash.
Garrett, I would slap you if I didn't know you were going to get your own planet when you die.
And until your father has 100% of the vote,
I think we can still make a difference.
I mean, look how poorly we're polling with African-Americans.
Jack, there's no amount of money that can --
How dare you talk that way in front of the pile!
There's no problem in the world that can't be solved by throwing money at it.
Now, let's change some black minds.
Look what Jenna's goons have done.
Pete's going insane.
The Pranksmen are neutered.
We can't let her get away with this.
What can we do?
We're just three nerdy white guys, and she's got a whole army!
But what if she didn't?
I know what we should do.
Pumpkin patch?
Black Americans for Romney.
Hi, I'm Hollywood liberal Don Cheadle, and I sup --
I support Mitt Romney.
Good.
Continue.
Barack Obama would have you believe that African-Americans are better off under his leadership.
But I just got ten million dollars for appearing in an ad for Mitt Romney.
So ask yourselves, brothers and sisters, who's really got your back?
'Cause from where I am standing, Mitt Romney is a --
MY dear!
Mitt Romney is a layup.
But don't just take it from me.
Take it from my good friend, the black Transformer, Jazz.
What's crackin', my homies?
Jazz gets down with the Rom-nizzle!
Oh, my God, does he really talk like that in the movie?
Paid for by Americans for an American America.
Dy-no-mite!
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
That is garbage.
What are you talking about?
That was Don Cheadle and Jazz, your heroes!
Do you know how expensive that was?
Okay, I get it.
Let me do some community organizing.
Sir, I am a deputized Election Monitor.
And when my supervisor Barbara gets out of her aquarobics class, she will be hearing about this.
If she's found the hearing aid she thinks her roommate stole.
In five, four, three...
- Listen up, America.
- ...two.
Thomas Jefferson once wrote --
"The greatest danger to American freedom..."
Shut up!
Listen to the words!
"...
Is the government that ignores the Constitution."
Take it off!
Oh!
Ooh!
This is so demoralizing.
In the past 24 hours, I've spent millions of dollars.
I got BET to let Mike Huckabee present
"Best Club Banger" at the Hip Hop Awards.
And yet we're still polling at 0% among African-Americans.
If my money can't make a difference, I'm moving to Monaco.
- Jack, don't say that.
- I'm serious.
Over there, they solve all their problems with money.
They use it to put out fires!
Ce feu m'ennuie.
Why should I even bother to vote?
New York will go for Obama even if I voted 100 times...
instead of my usual five.
Maybe you can make a difference in a battleground state --
Oh, what's the point, Garrett?
You know what?
I'll tell you exactly how this election is going to play out.
Hey, I just came in to see how my friend's doing.
But obviously he went back into his mouse hole so --
How are you?
Jack was right.
People don't want an idea bomb dropped on them.
Don't give up.
That is not the Lisa Loeb I know.
Why do I even vote?
New York's gonna go for Obama anyway.
Maybe if I lived in Ohio I could make a difference.
Actually, no.
Ohio's definitely going for Romney.
Yeah, you don't know which way Ohio's going.
But I do.
Liz Lemon, I've done stand-up in every state in this country.
I know the people of America.
I know how they think.
I can tell you exactly how this election is gonna play out.
Everyone knows Romney has a vacation home in New Hampshire.
What they don't know is that he hunts humans on that property.
New Hampshire goes to Obama.
Now, North Carolina goes to Romney.
I worked there this summer, and they are not on board with a black man lecturing them.
I don't care if it's Obama talking about healthcare, or me talking about white butts.
They are different than black butts!
Pennsylvania is Obama's.
The voting machines there have become sentient, and for some reason they are strongly in favor of gay marriage.
But we're not gonna win Wisconsin.
I don't know why.
Ever since Tracy set fire to Lambeau Field,
Wisconsinites are coming around on the death penalty.
Wisconsin goes for Romney.
That just leaves --
Florida!
The penis of America.
Florida.
The penis of America.
Pete, we have a scheme to destroy Jenna and her army of cretins!
For the past seven years, I've been compiling a supercut of all of Jenna Maroney's worst moments.
Security footage, cell phone videos, rehearsals, all her biggest diva freakouts are on this DVD.
When we put this online, the Crabcatchers will see what a fraud Jenna is.
Aah!
Someone get a PA to feed me baby food, or I will drop a "D" in the green room.
No!
Pete!
Why?
Last night, after the show I went to give them a piece of my mind...
Enjoy. bro!
But before I could, they gave me peace.
There were no 1020Gs down there, no neck pain.
No fear.
Just easy livin'.
Something you mainlanders wouldn't understand.
Pete, come on!
Pete's dead.
I'm Panama now.
Now, like any penis, Florida is very complicated.
The Cubans in the south, very conservative.
I had a lot of expensive cigars put out on me in Miami comedy clubs.
But Central Florida is dominated by Jewish retirees, serial killers, and secretly gay Disney princes.
All of whom love Obama.
Meanwhile, in northern Florida --
Huh.
The only crowds I could never figure out were in northern Florida.
One week, they're laughing at me, the next week they're laughing at me!
According to this, the electorate there is impossible to predict.
It's a combination of elderly shut-ins, beach bums,
- ...bus passengers - ...bus passengers
- who ran out of money, - who ran out of money, swamp people, and pirates.
These people don't like to be told what to do.
They just want to sit on a beach and drink.
Their motto is --
Unwindulax.
Unwindulax?
Oh, my God!
Mornin', Crabcatchers!
You all unwindulaxing?
One person can make a difference.
And that person is Jenna!
The next president of the United States will be chosen by...
Jenna Maroney.
To be continued...
Mr. Spider!
Ew, web in my mouth!
Next week on "30 Rock".
Will Jenna Maroney choose the next leader of the free world?
Will Jack or Liz manipulate her into doing the thing we just said?
Will Cerie ever wear a piece of clothing for its intended use?
Will Pete drop the whole Panama thing and have a totally different story?
Spoiler alert." Yes!
Is Tracy actually a ware otter?
Will Kellan Lutz fill his tummy with marshmallows?
Will the invisible murderer who's in every scene finally strike?
Will NBC's head of promotions ever get that mousetrap off his penis?
Will Kenneth finally defeat his nemesis, Mr. Spider?
Will your DVR cut this pro --?
Come on, put it...
Excuse me.
Out of the way, please.
[Groans]
Hey!
Chill out, mamacita.
What's with the, uh, weekday vibe.
- It is a Tuesday, sir.
- Hey, hey.
You work on that show?
Yeah, I work on that show.
Just like your mom works that street corner.
I'm sorry, that's too much.

My mom is a prostitute.
Hey!

[Cheering]
Hey!
New drinking game!
Drink when someone says something!
Whoo!
[Laughs]
Who are you people?
We're "Crabcatchers."

See, you people from New York, you don't know all the stuff that's going on in the rest of the country.

Well, since our weekend in Aspen, she's been put on pelvic rest.
[High-pitched gibberish] Fast-forward noise.
Marisol was supposed to attend a fundraiser luncheon with me today.
It's $10,000 a plate.
And I'll have to eat the ticket unless...
Unless I eat the ticket.
Fancy luncheon, seafood bar.
I'm thinking 75 cents a shrimp, over three hours, and split...
Carry 3.75...
[Imitates fast-forwarding]
By the time I'm done, you'll be making money.
Good.
I should warn you, though, that it's a Republican fundraiser.
So if you're coming, it won't be as Liz Lemon, huffpo superuser and gun-control lunatic.
You'll come as Liz Lemon, my chum.

Okay, I like that.

And I'm mad at your success, but pretending it's something else!
Okay, speaking of me, how many crabcatchers fiesta crab hats would each of you like to buy, at the unbelievable price of 49.95?
Please.
I've had a crab on my head for free!

Male gay.
Because with the ladies, it's too much hiking.
But homosexuality is unnatural, right?

They make love to their husband's blowholes.

And in her apartment there is a black-and-white photograph where you can almost see a breast.

For one thing, if you cross me or my army, you will never set foot in Florida again.
Because that's our capital.
But I'm judging Spike TV's Miss Nude divorcee in Tampa on Christmas Eve.
Oh.
And I was gonna visit MGM studios.
The rides there capture the thrills and chills of the movies.
And it doesn't end there, because my people are everywhere.

I don't know what else to tell you.
Lemon, there you are.
Did your girlfriend even cancel?
Or was this more Karl Rove trickery?
Sorry, but I needed you to come, Lemon.
This luncheon is a fundraiser for my personal super pac
"Americans for an American America."
I needed to unite the room around a common enemy.
And Ed Begley Jr.
wasn't available, because the sail on his car broke.
See, this is why 50.1% of Americans hate Republicans.
Because you're sneaky and cynical.
Cynical?
I think I'm the very opposite of cynical.
I'm doing everything I can for my beliefs.
And I truly believe that one rich person can make a difference in this country, and a roomful of rich people can... change the world.
Well, I also believe that one person can make a difference.
With ideas.
[Guffaws] That really is wonderful.
Harold, you have to hear this.
Lemon, say that again.
Ideas are more powerful than money.
[Laughter]
So what are you gonna do with all this money, Jack?
Buy ad time?
'Cause I'm already on TV every night, with a little something called TGS.
And we just got nominated for a stage managers' guild award.
So you may have millions of dollars, sir, but America will hear my two cents.
[Check rips from booklet]
That's not what people want, Lemon.
Least of all, from their televisions.
They want their honeys boo boo and their Sunday night feetball, which is the plural of football.
Americans don't want to think.
That's why they need men like me to pick their presidents for them.
Wow.
Okay.
So, I guess, it's my words versus your money.
And we'll see who can really make a difference in this election.
It's on, Donaghy.
May the best gender non-specific person win.
Just leave the amount blank, Harold.
[Clattering]
Those are tampons.
Deal with it.
[Crowd singing]
For God's sake, some of us have jobs!
I've got a pile of 1020-Gs up he with no travel times on them, and if I don't...
[Screams]
Listen up, nerds!
Tonight, TGS is about to get real.
We've got 38 minutes of air time...
An hour, if the bowling tournament ends early...
And we are gonna use it to get the message out there.
I don't know.
I think we've been hitting Romney pretty hard.
I guess that's why they call me Mitt.
"Baseball Mitt Romney" and "Barack a llama"
aren't saying anything.
I want to make a difference.
We got to do something big, something that'll go viral.
Like that otter that looked just like Tracy.
Look, we've got the greatest resource in the world at our fingertips:
American celebrity.
We get some hot young actor...
Oh, my grandnephew Kellan lutz, from Twilight, is visiting me.
He's in my office.
I have tolerated your pathological lying for six years.
If you speak again, I will kill you.
Great-uncle?
Momma's baby is out of "marsh-mal-lows."
Sweet grandnephew,
I've been warming more "marsh-mal-lows" for you in the pocket of my dungarees.
[Whimsical music]
[Laughs]
[Chomps]
Okay, good job, lutz.
Gentlemen, token silent lady, we have to spend all of our wonderful money, and help my hair-mentor, Mitt Romney, become the 11th legitimate President of the United States.
Garrett, what does the campaign need?
Well, as you know, with pacs like this, we're not allowed to have direct contact with candidates.
[Guffaws] I'm kidding.
I'm Garrett Romney, Mitt's my dad.
But here's the thing, Jack.
My brother-dad, which is mormon for "dad,"
has more money than he knows what to do with.
With all due respect, Garrett,
I don't think that's a thing.
Well, it's just, at this point in the campaign, for us, it's more about ideas than cash.
Garrett, I would slap you if I didn't know you were going to get your own planet when you die.
And until your father has 100% of the vote,
I think we can still make a difference.
I mean, look how poorly we're polling with African-Americans.
Jack, there's no amount of money that could...
How dare you talk that way in front of the pile.
[Goofy voice] Aw, thanks, Jack.
There is no problem in the world that can't be solved by throwing money at it.
Now, let's change some black minds.
[Crowd singing]
Look what Jenna's goons have done.
Pete's going insane.
The pranksmen are neutered.
We can't let her get away with this.
Well, what can we do?
We're just three nerdy white guys, and she's got a whole army.
But what if she didn't?
I know what we should do.
Pumpkin patch?
Hi, I'm Hollywood liberal Don Cheadle, and I supp...
I support Mitt Romney.
Good, continue.
Barack Obama would have you believe that African-Americans are better off under his leadership.
But I just got $10 million for appearing in an ad for Mitt Romney.
So ask yourselves, brothers and sisters, who's really got your back?
'Cause from where I'm standing,
Mitt Romney is a...
Oh, my dear...
Mitt Romney is a layup.
But don't just take it from me.
Take it from my good friend the black transformer, jazz.
What's crackin', my homies?
Jazz gets down with the rom-nizzle.
Oh, my God, does he really talk like that in the movie?
Paid for by Americans for an American America.
"Dy-no-mite."
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
That is garbage.
What are you talking about?
That was don cheadle and jazz, your heroes.
Do you know how expensive that was?
Okay, I get it.
Let me do some, uh, community organizing.
Sir, I am a deputized election monitor, and when my supervisor Barbara gets out of her aquarobics class, she will be hearing about this, if she's found the hearing aid she thinks her roommate stole.
[Upbeat music]
In five, four, three, two.
[Applause]
Listen up, America.
[Applause]
Thomas Jefferson once wrote...
[Cheering, screaming and applause]
[Yelling] The greatest danger to American freedom...
Shut up!
Listen to the words!
[Yelling] Is a government that ignores the constitution.
Take it off!
No.
[Cheering and screaming]
Whoo!
This is so demoralizing!
In the past 24 hours,
I've spent millions of dollars.
I got B.E.T. to let Mike Huckabee present
"Best Club Banger" at the Hip-Hop Awards.
And yet we're still polling at 0% among African-Americans.
If my money can't make a difference,
I'm moving to Monaco.
- Jack, don't say that.
- I'm serious.
Over there, they solve all their problems with money.
They use it to put out fires.
Ce feu m'ennuie.
Why should I even bother to vote?
New York will go for Obama even if I voted a hundred times.
Instead of my usual five.
Maybe you can make a difference in a battleground state.
Oh, what's the point, Garrett?
You know what?
I'll tell you exactly how this election is going to play out.
[Cheering on TV]
Hey.
I just came in to see how my friend's doing, but obviously he went back into his mouse hole, so, uh...
How are you?
[Scoffs]
Jack was right.
[Cheering stops]
People don't want an idea bomb dropped on them.
Don't give up.
That is not the Lisa Loeb I know.
Why do I even vote?
New York's gonna go for Obama anyway.
Maybe if I lived in Ohio, I could make a difference.
Actually, no.
Ohio's definitely going for Romney.
Yeah, you don't know which way Ohio's going.
But I do.
Liz Lemon, I've done stand-up in every state in this country.
I know the people of America.
I know how they think.
I can tell you exactly how this election is gonna play out.
Everyone knows Romney has a vacation home in New Hampshire.
What they don't know is that he hunts humans on that property.
New Hampshire goes to Obama.
Now, North Carolina goes to Romney.
I worked there this summer, and they are not on board with a black man lecturing them.
I don't care if it's Obama talking about health care or me talking about white butts.
They are different than black butts.
Pennsylvania is Obama's.
The voting machines there have become sentient.
And, for some reason, they are strongly in favor of gay marriage.
But we're not gonna win Wisconsin.
I don't know why.
Ever since Tracy set fire to Lambeau Field,
Wisconsinites are coming around on the death penalty.
Wisconsin goes for Romney.
That just leaves...
Florida, the penis of America!
Florida...
The penis of America.
Pete!
We have a scheme to destroy Jenna and her army of cretins.
For the past seven years,
I've been compiling a supercut of all of Jenna Maroney's worst moments.
Security footage, cell phone videos, rehearsals...
All her biggest diva freak-outs are on this DVD.
When we put this online, the crabcatchers will see what a fraud Jenna is.
[Grunting]
Someone get a P.A. to feed me baby food.
Or I will drop a "D" in the greenroom.
No, Pete!
Why?
Last night, after the show...
[Cheering, rhythm instruments jingling]
I went to give them a piece of my mind.
Enjoy, bro.
But before I could... ♪ Slow down they gave me peace.
♪ Way down
♪ go down to the water there were no 1020-Gs down there.
No neck pain.
No fear.
Just easy livin'.
Something you mainlanders wouldn't understand.
Pete, come on.
Pete's dead.
I'm Panama, now.
Now, like any penis,
Florida is very complicated.
The Cubans in the South...
Very conservative.
I had a lot of expensive cigars put out on me in Miami comedy clubs.
But central Florida is dominated by Jewish retirees, serial killers, and secretly gay Disney princes, all of whom love Obama.
Meanwhile...
In Northern Florida...
Huh.
The only crowds I could never figure out were in Northern Florida.
One week they're laughing at me, the next week, they're laughing at me.
According to this, the electorate there is impossible to predict.
It's a combination of elderly shut-ins, beach bums...
Both:
Bus passengers who ran out of money...
Swamp people and pirates.
These people don't like to be told what to do.
They just want to sit on the beach and drink.
There motto is "unwindulax."
Unwindulax.
[Crowd chanting "Jenna"]
Oh, my God.
[Crowd chanting "Jenna"]
Morning, Crabcatchers.
[Crowd chanting "Jenna"]
You all unwindulaxing?

One person can make a difference.
[Whispers] And that person is Jenna!
The next president of the United States will be chosen by...
Jenna Maroney.
To be continued...
Mr. Spider.
Ew, web in my mouth!
Male announcer:
Next week, on 30 Rock...
Will Jenna Maroney choose the next leader of the free world?
Will Jack or Liz manipulate her into doing the thing we just said?
Will Cerie ever wear a piece of clothing for its intended use?
Will Pete drop the whole "Panama" thing, and have a totally different story?
Spoiler alert...
Yes.
Is Tracy actually a wereotter?
Will Kellan Lutz fill his tummy with "marsh-mal-lows"?
Will the invisible murderer who's in every scene finally strike?
Will NBC's head of promotions ever get that mousetrap off his penis?
Will Kenneth finally defeat his Nemesis, Mr. Spider?
Will your DVR cut this pro...
Come on, put it...
Excuse me.
Out of the way, please.
Hey!

I don't know what else to tell you.
Lemon, there you are.
Did your girlfriend even cancel?
Or was this more Karl Rove trickery?
Sorry, but I needed you to come, Lemon.
This luncheon is a fundraiser for my personal super pac
"Americans for an American America."
I needed to unite the room around a common enemy.
And Ed Begley Jr.
wasn't available, because the sail on his car broke.
See, this is why 50.1% of Americans hate Republicans.
Because you're sneaky and cynical.
Cynical?
I think I'm the very opposite of cynical.
I'm doing everything I can for my beliefs.
And I truly believe that one rich person can make a difference in this country, and a roomful of rich people can... change the world.
Well, I also believe that one person can make a difference.
With ideas.
That really is wonderful.
Harold, you have to hear this.
Lemon, say that again.
Ideas are more powerful than money.
So what are you gonna do with all this money, Jack?
Buy ad time?
'Cause I'm already on TV every night, with a little something called TGS.
And we just got nominated for a stage managers' guild award.
So you may have millions of dollars, sir, but America will hear my two cents.
That's not what people want, Lemon.
Least of all, from their televisions.
They want their honeys boo boo and their Sunday night feetball, which is the plural of football.
Americans don't want to think.
That's why they need men like me to pick their presidents for them.
Okay.
So, I guess, it's my words versus your money.
And we'll see who can really make a difference in this election.
It's on, Donaghy.
May the best gender non-specific person win.
Just leave the amount blank, Harold.
Those are tampons.
Deal with it.
For God's sake, some of us have jobs!
I've got a pile of 1020-Gs up he with no travel times on them, and if I don't...
Listen up, nerds!
Tonight, TGS is about to get real.
We've got 38 minutes of air time...
An hour, if the bowling tournament ends early...
And we are gonna use it to get the message out there.
I don't know.
I think we've been hitting Romney pretty hard.
I guess that's why they call me Mitt.
"Baseball Mitt Romney" and "Barack a llama"
aren't saying anything.
I want to make a difference.
We got to do something big, something that'll go viral.
Like that otter that looked just like Tracy.
Look, we've got the greatest resource in the world at our fingertips:
American celebrity.
We get some hot young actor...
My grandnephew Kellan lutz, from Twilight, is visiting me.
He's in my office.
I have tolerated your pathological lying for six years.
If you speak again, I will kill you.
Great-uncle?
Momma's baby is out of "marsh-mal-lows."
Sweet grandnephew,
I've been warming more "marsh-mal-lows" for you in the pocket of my dungarees.
Okay, good job, lutz.
Gentlemen, token silent lady, we have to spend all of our wonderful money, and help my hair-mentor, Mitt Romney, become the 11th legitimate President of the United States.
Garrett, what does the campaign need?
Well, as you know, with pacs like this, we're not allowed to have direct contact with candidates.
I'm kidding.
I'm Garrett Romney, Mitt's my dad.
But here's the thing, Jack.
My brother-dad, which is mormon for "dad,"
has more money than he knows what to do with.
With all due respect, Garrett,
I don't think that's a thing.
Well, it's just, at this point in the campaign, for us, it's more about ideas than cash.
Garrett, I would slap you if I didn't know you were going to get your own planet when you die.
And until your father has 100% of the vote,
I think we can still make a difference.
I mean, look how poorly we're polling with African-Americans.
Jack, there's no amount of money that could...
How dare you talk that way in front of the pile.
Thanks, Jack.
There is no problem in the world that can't be solved by throwing money at it.
Now, let's change some black minds.
Look what Jenna's goons have done.
Pete's going insane.
The pranksmen are neutered.
We can't let her get away with this.
Well, what can we do?
We're just three nerdy white guys, and she's got a whole army.
But what if she didn't?
I know what we should do.
Pumpkin patch?
Hi, I'm Hollywood liberal Don Cheadle, and I supp...
I support Mitt Romney.
Good, continue.
Barack Obama would have you believe that African-Americans are better off under his leadership.
But I just got $10 million for appearing in an ad for Mitt Romney.
So ask yourselves, brothers and sisters, who's really got your back?
'Cause from where I'm standing,
Mitt Romney is a...
My dear...
Mitt Romney is a layup.
But don't just take it from me.
Take it from my good friend the black transformer, jazz.
What's crackin', my homies?
Jazz gets down with the rom-nizzle.
My God, does he really talk like that in the movie?
Paid for by Americans for an American America.
"Dy-no-mite."
For heaven's sakes.
That is garbage.
What are you talking about?
That was don cheadle and jazz, your heroes.
Do you know how expensive that was?
Okay, I get it.
Let me do some, community organizing.
Sir, I am a deputized election monitor, and when my supervisor Barbara gets out of her aquarobics class, she will be hearing about this, if she's found the hearing aid she thinks her roommate stole.
In five, four, three, two.
Listen up, America.
Thomas Jefferson once wrote...
The greatest danger to American freedom...
Shut up!
Listen to the words!
Is a government that ignores the constitution.
Take it off!
No.
Whoo!
This is so demoralizing!
In the past 24 hours,
I've spent millions of dollars.
I got B.E.T. to let Mike Huckabee present
"Best Club Banger" at the Hip-Hop Awards.
And yet we're still polling at 0% among African-Americans.
If my money can't make a difference,
I'm moving to Monaco.
- Jack, don't say that.
- I'm serious.
Over there, they solve all their problems with money.
They use it to put out fires.
Ce feu m'ennuie.
Why should I even bother to vote?
New York will go for Obama even if I voted a hundred times.
Instead of my usual five.
Maybe you can make a difference in a battleground state.
What's the point, Garrett?
You know what?
I'll tell you exactly how this election is going to play out.
Hey.
I just came in to see how my friend's doing, but obviously he went back into his mouse hole, so,
How are you?
Jack was right.
People don't want an idea bomb dropped on them.
Don't give up.
That is not the Lisa Loeb I know.
Why do I even vote?
New York's gonna go for Obama anyway.
Maybe if I lived in Ohio, I could make a difference.
Actually, no.
Ohio's definitely going for Romney.
Yeah, you don't know which way Ohio's going.
But I do.
Liz Lemon, I've done stand-up in every state in this country.
I know the people of America.
I know how they think.
I can tell you exactly how this election is gonna play out.
Everyone knows Romney has a vacation home in New Hampshire.
What they don't know is that he hunts humans on that property.
New Hampshire goes to Obama.
Now, North Carolina goes to Romney.
I worked there this summer, and they are not on board with a black man lecturing them.
I don't care if it's Obama talking about health care or me talking about white butts.
They are different than black butts.
Pennsylvania is Obama's.
The voting machines there have become sentient.
And, for some reason, they are strongly in favor of gay marriage.
But we're not gonna win Wisconsin.
I don't know why.
Ever since Tracy set fire to Lambeau Field,
Wisconsinites are coming around on the death penalty.
Wisconsin goes for Romney.
That just leaves...
Florida, the penis of America!
Florida...
The penis of America.
Pete!
We have a scheme to destroy Jenna and her army of cretins.
For the past seven years,
I've been compiling a supercut of all of Jenna Maroney's worst moments.
Security footage, cell phone videos, rehearsals...
All her biggest diva freak-outs are on this DVD.
When we put this online, the crabcatchers will see what a fraud Jenna is.
Someone get a P.A. to feed me baby food.
Or I will drop a "D" in the greenroom.
No, Pete!
Why?
Last night, after the show...
I went to give them a piece of my mind.
Enjoy, bro.
But before I could... ♪ Slow down they gave me peace.
♪ Way down
♪ go down to the water there were no 1020-Gs down there.
No neck pain.
No fear.
Just easy livin'.
Something you mainlanders wouldn't understand.
Pete, come on.
Pete's dead.
I'm Panama, now.
Now, like any penis,
Florida is very complicated.
The Cubans in the South...
Very conservative.
I had a lot of expensive cigars put out on me in Miami comedy clubs.
But central Florida is dominated by Jewish retirees, serial killers, and secretly gay Disney princes, all of whom love Obama.
Meanwhile...
In Northern Florida...
The only crowds I could never figure out were in Northern Florida.
One week they're laughing at me, the next week, they're laughing at me.
According to this, the electorate there is impossible to predict.
It's a combination of elderly shut-ins, beach bums...
Bus passengers who ran out of money...
Swamp people and pirates.
These people don't like to be told what to do.
They just want to sit on the beach and drink.
There motto is "unwindulax."
Unwindulax.
My God.
Morning, Crabcatchers.
You all unwindulaxing?
One person can make a difference.
And that person is Jenna!
The next president of the United States will be chosen by...
Jenna Maroney.
To be continued...
Mr. Spider.
Ew, web in my mouth!
Next week, on 30 Rock...
Will Jenna Maroney choose the next leader of the free world?
Will Jack or Liz manipulate her into doing the thing we just said?
Will Cerie ever wear a piece of clothing for its intended use?
Will Pete drop the whole "Panama" thing, and have a totally different story?
Spoiler alert...
Yes.
Is Tracy actually a wereotter?
Will Kellan Lutz fill his tummy with "marsh-mal-lows"?
Will the invisible murderer who's in every scene finally strike?
Will NBC's head of promotions ever get that mousetrap off his penis?
Will Kenneth finally defeat his Nemesis, Mr. Spider?
Will your DVR cut this pro...
Come on, do it!
Excuse me!
Out of the way, please!
- Hey!
- Chill out, mamacita!
What's with the weekday vibe?
It is a Tuesday, sir.
Hey, hey, you work on that show?
Yeah, I work on that show.
Just like your mom works that street corner --
I'm sorry, it's too much.
No sweat.
My mom is a prostitute.
Hey, this chick knows Jenna Maroney!
Hey, new drinking game!
Drink when someone says something!
Who are you, people?
!
We're Crabcatchers!
You know, from Jenna's song "Catchin' Crabs in Paradise".
J' I caught crabs in paradise J'
J' And yes I mean both kinds of crabs J'
Ugh!
I thought that was at least gonna be innuendo.
Jenna's playing on "Today" show in a couple of days, so we're just camping out and unwindulaxing.
Wait!
So Jenna's Jimmy Buffett ripoff is actually a thing?
See?
You people from New York don't know all the stuff that's going on in the rest of the country.
Truck races.
Swamp parties.
Mall fires.
I can't believe she's pulling this off.
And I can't believe I'm pulling this off!
Why do you have a tattoo of a seat belt?
So I don't get pulled over when I'm driving shirtless!
You wanted to see me?
Have I mentioned Marisol, the Mexican sideline reporter I've been seeing?
Well, since our weekend in Aspen, she's been put on pelvic rest --
Fast-forward noise!
Marisol was supposed to attend a fundraiser luncheon with me today.
It's ten thousand dollars a plate, and I'll have to eat the ticket unless --
Unless I eat the ticket.
Fancy luncheon.
Seafood bar.
I'm thinking 75 cents a shrimp over three hours.
Carry three .75 times --
By the time I'm done, you'll be making money.
Good.
But I should warn you, though, this is a Republican fundraiser.
So if you're coming, it won't be as Liz Lemon,
Huff Po superuser and gun control lunatic.
You'll come as Liz Lemon, my chum.
"Chum"?
Okay, I like that.
And you'll be able to keep your opinions to yourself?
Oh, good Lord, Lemon, you just locked your mouth and then swallowed the key.
It makes no earthly sense!
Shrimp!
7x04
- Unwindulax Original Air Date on October 25, 2012
Jenna's crab idiots won't shut up!
Why couldn't she have died when that rabid dog bit her?
Oh, it wasn't rabid.
I just said that so they'd have to put it down.
And then I'd be the star of that dog food commercial!
I had to walk an extra block to get around your stupid Crabcatchers.
My doctors have been very clear about this, Jenna.
If I get moderate exercise, I'm gonna die!
And I'm mad at your success, but I'm pretending it's something else!
Okay, speaking of me, how many Crabcatchers Fiesta Crab Hats would each of you like to buy at the unbelievable price of $49.95?
Please!
I've had a crab on my head for free!
I'm lying.
The claws hold your cigarette while you uncork a brew-skye --
"Uncork a brew-skye"?
Yeah.
You know --
Ka-zap!
Blinky-blinky-blinky-blinky --
Those aren't even the right noises!
Everyone knows you hate stuff like this.
You're maybe the most high-maintenance bitch in Hollywood!
"Maybe"?
Who's more?
Who is she?
Okay.
Cut this crap out and get those sunburned d-bags out of the Plaza!
Hey, no can will, Pete.
But have an unwindulaxing day!
You medical office before pictures!
I've never even seen a crab.
I'm sorry.
I don't need some Kenyan-born college professor telling me I didn't build my company.
Because I earned my trust fund by always being polite to Grandfather.
Now, Donaghy!
Still over at NBC with all those communists and homosexuals?
Reginald, I believe you're thinking of the White House.
But not for long.
In two weeks, we take this country back.
And no bureaucrat can force me to subsidize female promiscuity in the name of healthcare.
You okay, chum?
Michelle Obama's on steroids.
And this is Studio 6H.
Home to "TGS" stars, Tracy Jordan, Jenna Maroney...
Oh, my God!
It's Jenna!
Visor Lady, get a picture of me!
What do I--?
Press the button?
No, it's different from every other camera in the world!
God, I can't escape you, people!
Whoa!
Chill out, brother!
It's beer o'clock somewhere!
You're a fraud!
And you look like a condom that's been dropped on the floor of a barbershop!
Are you all unwindulaxing?
This guy looks like he could use a little latitude adjustment.
Rude!
Will you sign my Caesarean scar --?
Oh!
Ahh!
You moron!
Hey, it's just a party foul.
Exactly.
That's why I said, "You!
More on."
Like "pour more on me"!
Oh, my God.
She can't be herself in front of these losers.
She has to be "Island Jenna".
Which means...
- We can mess with --
- We should go to a pumpkin patch?
Pranksmen, activate.
Obama's bailout would never have worked if big business hadn't heroically taken it.
But where's our parade?
- That's idiotic!
- Lemon!
No, sir!
You don't have enough shrimp to buy my silence!
Also you're out of shrimp!
You know better, Jack.
You all know better.
Except maybe the really inbred WASPs.
You thank for mention Gordeau!
Sure.
You're hypocrites.
You believe in the death penalty, but it's okay to kill animals for food?
I don't know where I'm going with this yet.
Hang on, hang on!
My boyfriend and I aren't married, but we might have a baby together anyway.
And I hope it's gay -
- Male gay!
Because if it's a lady, it's too much hiking.
But homosexuality is unnatural, right?
Then why are there gay dolphins, people?
You heard me.
They make love to their husbands' blowholes.
Let's see that in some science textbooks!
Oh, that's right.
The whole Texas Board of Education thing that I don't fully remember.
Teachers should get paid a million dollars a year!
If birth control pills fixed boners, you would get them free with your driver's license!
And how do we know that God isn't a tree?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Elizabeth Lemon.
And this is what we're up against.
Four more years of a president chosen by people like her.
She has an iPad subscription to The New Yorker.
She vehemently opposes the ivory trade despite the jobs it creates.
And in her apartment there was a black-and-white photograph where you can almost see a breast.
It's an original Leonard Nimoy!
If we do not defeat Obama, people like my little friend here will destroy this country.
So add a zero to whatever you were planning to give.
For Romney, for America, for anyone but her.
What the hell, Jack?
I thought you said I was your chum!
You are my chum.
The bait I throw in the water to attract the big fish.
Dammit!
Second meaning!
Hey...
Yeah.
Whoa!
What are you douche-compadres doing here?
Well, Jenna, everyone knows how you're always so chill.
So, of course, you won't freak out when you see that Cerie's wearing that exact same shirt.
As a dress.
The belt is a baby's necktie!
Also, I found a bunch of your pre-nosejob headshots.
You'll sign them so I can sell them online, right?
Of course.
'Cause who cares what you look like?
All that counts is what's inside your blender.
I'm glad you feel that way.
'Cause I've always wanted to give you a haircut!
Yeah!
You virgins have no idea who you're messing with --
Whoa, Jenna, unwindulax.
Oh, I'm not just Jenna anymore.
I'm a god to those Crabcatchers.
And they will do whatever I say.
So what?
I'll tell you "so what".
For one thing, if you cross me or my army, you will never set foot in Florida again.
Because that's our capital.
But I'm judging Spike TV's
"Miss Nude Divorcée" in Tampa on Christmas Eve!
Oh...
And I was gonna visit MGM Studios.
The rides there capture the thrills and chills of the movies!
And it doesn't end there.
Because my people are everywhere.
If you ever want to pick your ball color at a putt-putt course, or have your alligator euthanized humanely, or fly on Delta, you will back off.
Or the Crabcatchers will come for you.
Just as soon as it's cool for them to drive.
It's a gray hoodie.
It says "Who Farted?" on the back.
It's got a bunch of tampons in the pocket!
I don't know what else to tell you.
Lemon, there you are.
Did your girlfriend even cancel or was that more Karl Rove trickery?
I'm sorry, but I needed you to come, Lemon.
This luncheon is a fundraiser for my personal Super PAC,
"Americans for an American America".
I needed to unite the room around a common enemy, and Ed Begley, Jr. wasn't available because the sail on his car broke.
See, this is why 50.1% of Americans hate Republicans.
Because you're sneaky and cynical.
Cynical?

Oh!
That really is wonderful.
Harold, you have to hear this.
Lemon, say that again.
Ideas are more powerful than money.
So what are you gonna do with all this money, Jack?
Buy ad time?
'Cause I'm already on TV every night, with a little something called "TGS".
And we just got nominated for a Stage Managers' Guild Award.
So you may have millions of dollars, sir, but America's will hear my two cents!
That's not what people want, Lemon, least of all from their televisions.
They want their "Honeys Boo Boo" and their Sunday Night Feetball, which is the plural of "football".
Americans don't want to think.
That's why they need men like me to pick their presidents for them.
Wow.
Okay.
So I guess it's my words versus your money.
And we'll see who can really make a difference in this election.
It's on, Donaghy.
May the best gender non-specific person win.
Just leave the amount blank, Harold.
Those are tampons.
Deal with it.
For God's sake, some of us have jobs!
I've got a pile of 1020Gs up here with no travel times on them!
And if I don't --!
Oh!
Aah!
Listen up, nerds!
Tonight, "TGS" is about to get real.
We've got 38 minutes of air-time, an hour if the bowling tournament ends early, and we're gonna use it to get the message out there.
I don't know, I think we've been hitting Romney pretty hard.
I guess that's why they call me "Mitt".
"Baseball Mitt Romney" and "Barack, A Llama" aren't saying anything!
I want to make a difference.
We've got to do something big.
Something that will go viral, like that otter that looked just like Tracy.
Look, we've got the greatest resource in the world at our fingertips -
- American celebrity.
We get some hot young actor --
Oh, my grand-nephew Kellan Lutz from "Twilight" is visiting me.
He's in my office.
I have tolerated your pathological lying for six years.
If you speak again, I will kill you.
Great uncle?
Mama's baby is out of marshmallows.
Sweet grand-nephew, I've been warming more marshmallows for you in the pocket of my dungarees.
Okay.
Good job, Lutz.
Gentlemen!
Token silent lady...
We have to spend all of our wonderful money and help my hair-mentor, Mitt Romney, become the eleventh legitimate president of the United States.
Garrett, what does the campaign need?
Well, as you know, with PACs like this, we're not allowed to have direct contact with candidates.
I'm kidding.
I'm Garrett Romney.
Mitt's my dad.

Well, it's just, at this point in the campaign, for us it's more about ideas than cash.

Now, let's change some black minds.
Look what Jenna's goons have done.

What can we do?
We're just three nerdy white guys, and she's got a whole army!
But what if she didn't?
I know what we should do.
Pumpkin patch?
Black Americans for Romney.
Hi, I'm Hollywood liberal Don Cheadle, and I sup --
I support Mitt Romney.
Good.
Continue.
Barack Obama would have you believe that African-Americans are better off under his leadership.
But I just got ten million dollars for appearing in an ad for Mitt Romney.
So ask yourselves, brothers and sisters, who's really got your back?
'Cause from where I am standing, Mitt Romney is a --

Jazz gets down with the Rom-nizzle!
Oh, my God, does he really talk like that in the movie?
Paid for by Americans for an American America.
Dy-no-mite!
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
That is garbage.
What are you talking about?
That was Don Cheadle and Jazz, your heroes!
Do you know how expensive that was?
Okay, I get it.
Let me do some community organizing.
Sir, I am a deputized Election Monitor.
And when my supervisor Barbara gets out of her aquarobics class, she will be hearing about this.
If she's found the hearing aid she thinks her roommate stole.
In five, four, three...
- Listen up, America.
- ...two.
Thomas Jefferson once wrote --
"The greatest danger to American freedom..."
Shut up!
Listen to the words!

Why should I even bother to vote?
New York will go for Obama even if I voted 100 times...

It's a combination of elderly shut-ins, beach bums,
- ...bus passengers - ...bus passengers
- who ran out of money, - who ran out of money, swamp people, and pirates.
These people don't like to be told what to do.
They just want to sit on a beach and drink.
Their motto is --
Unwindulax.
Unwindulax?
Oh, my God!
Mornin', Crabcatchers!
You all unwindulaxing?
One person can make a difference.
And that person is Jenna!
The next president of the United States will be chosen by...
Jenna Maroney.
To be continued...
Mr. Spider!
Ew, web in my mouth!
Next week on "30 Rock".
Will Jenna Maroney choose the next leader of the free world?
Will Jack or Liz manipulate her into doing the thing we just said?
Will Cerie ever wear a piece of clothing for its intended use?
Will Pete drop the whole Panama thing and have a totally different story?
Spoiler alert." Yes!
Is Tracy actually a ware otter?
Will Kellan Lutz fill his tummy with marshmallows?
Will the invisible murderer who's in every scene finally strike?
Will NBC's head of promotions ever get that mousetrap off his penis?
Will Kenneth finally defeat his nemesis, Mr. Spider?
Will your DVR cut this pro --?
Yes, my dear Kurup
Though relieved from the case that cheap girl made me lose Rs18,00000 I wouldn't have felt so bad if there actually was ...something explosive as the newspapers made out
This was like having a full meal and yet remaining hungry
I am right now traveling the Kottayam-Kattappana route
Rememberthat doctor who examined me and certified that such an incident never happened?
Yes, Dr Kurian George I am on way to stuff 3 lakhs down his throat
Who the hell is that?
Yes, dude His house is in Kottayam
But he is not there now
He's gone to Kattapana to some forest on a hunting trip
Yes with this, his quota will be over Who the hell is that?
Listen Kurup, I will call you back later Disconnect now
Who the hell is swearing like this from behind?
It's a lady
Lady?
How did you guess?
Look at this
Let me see
Santhosh, those hands are quite youthful I too thought so Max 25 years
Look man, allow her some space
But boss, then she will just drive away
Fool, don't give her enough space to overtake
She's parallel to us...
like this
Let me see her 1st
Then I shall decide whether to allow her to overtake or to drive alongside her
Oh!
So that's your idea Now I understand
Come on get her nearer I say
Slowly
Hey!
You don't need to look at her, okay?
Santhosh, she's quite a gal, man She appears to guess what I want lsn't it a well known fact, boss that in such matters luck is always with you
Go alongside as close as you can
Hey baby, coming here?
Or shall I come there?
Excuse me
Sir, she has identified these ornaments as belonging to her daughter
Abdul Haji's son, Yousuf of Kodivalappu
Since the prosecution has failed to provide ample proof to support the charges ...filed against the defendant ...the court hereby releases the accused unconditionally
Moreover, the destitute women centre ...which had been shut down following police raid ...as well as other social organizations run by the accused with good intentions ...the court is fully convinced about authenticity of such activities
And so gives him full freedom to continue heading such organizations in future
The ips officer investigating this case does not have sufficient years in service
The enquiries in this case and many procedures ...from the police has been totally one sided
The court finds the over enthusiasm and lack of experience of the enquiring officer as reasons
Acting on the basis of a mere newspaper report without proper evidences damaging the reputation of the accused who is also a social worker ...situation of the enquiring officer in such circumstances is truly unfortunate
The otherfactor that has caused the court misgivings was the irresponsible and inconsiderate manner with which media has behaved
A reporter without ethics, if he wanted can for some period at least make a person a criminal in the eyes of the public
This case is a perfect example
Listen Mila, I did not...
Dude, he mentioned reporters in general Your name was never mentioned, was it?
Don't utter another word
Mentioning my name too would have totally satisfied you, isn't it?
I jumped and acted on your words which has made me hear all this today I am very sure, my dear lawyer that Yousuf and his brother Yakub will be responsible for my death
Hey man!
Journalism is not for utter cowards like you
You should stop all this And go do some job which is much safer
- My job is not like yours
- How can you say that?
Hey stop it!
This is like the squabble of a couple who've come to a family court for divorce
What's over is over Let's go in for an appeal against this
My foot!
There is not going to be any appeal You try reaching home, my dear lawyer
Let me also go before the next rains
Actually this appeal should be...
Okay, no...
Shree!
What's it my friend?
That fellow's stance on the bike appears to be a little abnormal, dude i just remembered an important file for tomorrow's case I will be back with it soon, okay?
After bringing this upon our heads now don't you dare laugh!
You lt was you alone at fault
Yes lt was my fault
That's exactly why I say just go and retrieve your vehicle bravely
That fellow will not be able to do anything to you
Go I'll be near my jeep I will go only after you leave
Give me that key, Yakub I am busy I will
Just stretch out your right hand I'll give it to you
Wasn't it this hand that wrote all that stuff against my brother?
So I have decided to take this hand for myself
You can eat drink and wash yourself with just 1 hand here after
A single hand is more than enough to write about criminals like you and your brother
He's gone Now what will you do?
Yakub, our issues should not be solved here
Let me know when and where l shall come there
That is not enough, Mila I want you on these court premises and that too, today
I found the working space too little here So I thought I'll park the jeep outside lt's our duty to look after public property
Yakub, don't ask for kicks from boots the government has authorized
Go, chop up a goat and give your brother some soup
His body was roughened up by police while in custody
Can never say when he will fall
Shreeramakrishna!
You are about to be paid back for everything you did to my brother
Hey Mila!
He left with his bike as soon as the fight began, sir
Who is it?
Who is it, I say?
You nasty cur!
You never called even once to find out if I was dead or alive lsn't that why I am watching this news channel continuously
Take away the knife, dude lf something had happened to you will there not be flash news saying...
Asst Superintendent of Police Shreeramakrishna injured?
If I hadn't interfered in time there would've been ...some other news scrolled across
I think, with this the 1st suspension order is ready for me
The Superintendent of Police wants to see me tomorrow, wonder what will happen?
Born under the 27th asterism and with Venus's fantastic influence ...remember I had once stated that till your 34th year you'd lead a blessed life?
Yes, I do
What did you reply then?
If Venus was this bad then what would be my fate under Saturn?
When I got your suspension order yesterday at noon ...I felt what you said that day was true
But I was convinced of the power of this asterism along with Venus when I got this envelope last evening
There was a meeting yesterday to discuss the internal affairs of our state
The Central Minister at Delhi asked our State Minister for an explanation
Regarding a car that exploded in a bomb near Elappara 2 days back ...in which a business man and social worker Balagangadharan was killed
Though our minister managed with whatever information ...he had, the Minister in Delhi was not at all satisfied
He has insisted on a condition regarding the investigation of that case
He wants only you to take up further investigations
Me?
What do you mean, sir?
How does he know me?
That is the suspense in this matter
Balagangadaran's nephew is amongst the most trusted staff of the Central Home Minister
Ayoung blood like you He was the one who recommended your name
He made the Central Minister request for you very strongly lt is that order in this envelope
Why do you look disinterested?
This Balagangadharan who you claim is a businessman and social worker ...has another claim to fame which you have left out
He was a chronic womanizer
He was recently accused in almost 3-4 cases of molestation
That I know So what?
His character as well as his atrocities in business and politics has earned him ...many enemies at the top levels
Not only that, donning this uniform I can't nab a 3rd rate character like Yousuf
Think of my fate tackling big shots like them under the pretext of investigation
But this Balagangadharan case has so far not revealed the presence of big shots
You would have come to know through media broadcasts
Daksha Das a 23 year old engineering student committed that murder
She also died in the explosion
Balagangadharan's driver Santosh in his dying statement has said ...that Daksha, with precise planning had deliberately committed this murder
But we have not been able to establish any relationship or vengeful motive between Daksha and Balagangadharan lt is this point of the case that I feel is most thrilling I understand what you mean But I...
Shreeram, this is notjust a cat and mouse game ...like the others you have handled so far I am sure this will be a different experience for you
All details of this investigation including the dying declaration of Santhosh is here in this file Anyway, all the best
Right from Mundakayam that girl was right behind us
When we were near Elappara boss asked me to allow her to come alongside
Finally when there was not enough space and both cars were traveling parallel ...she waved her hand at my boss and pressed the buttons of the remote control
Then an explosion That's all I remember
What is your opinion on this?
What opinion could I possibly have?
At least he's gone without suffering anymore
That itself is a great blessing
That's not what I meant, dude The question is, where should I begin?
With Balagangadharan or Daksha Frankly, I am a little confused in this I knew when you called me desperately that you had some new conflict
Haven't you had enough getting me into trouble, Shree?
Haven't I told you many times that when you are with me ...I have immense confidence
But I don't feel the same I have told you after the Yousuf case to go your way and leave me to mine I am preparing an article on the problems launderers' face during rainy season
Likewise I shall spend the rest of my life writing stuff without troubling anyone else
Please don't harass me anymore
Go I don't need your help anymore to investigate this case I have started my investigation with a very precise plan I have a list of people who are ...Balagangadharan's enemies in business and politics
You just wait and see I will haul up every one of them however big a vip he is
Then you are in for trouble
My dear Shree, stop being impulsive and ...start dealing with matters after analyzing it
Then start investigating it lf Balagangadharan is a novel with 100 pages ...that girl Daksha is just a short story of 2-3 pages
Whatever we read we want only one information
So why not start with Daksha...?
So why not begin with the short story called Daksha, isn't it?
Yes, of course
Now I am sure my investigation has started in the correct route
What do you think of my brains ...for extracting information without you realizing it?
This kick is not for you But those who gave you the ips position
Get lost
Are you leaving?
Don't go, don't be angry with me
Friend oh my friend I am filled with affection for you
You are forever on the lap of my thoughts
Within the waves of the sea he is an emerald isle
Friend, he is always my friend
Friend oh my friend I am filled with affection for you
You are forever on the lap of my thoughts

Friend oh my friend
- Sir, tea
- How old was she when... 15 years She was in 10th grade lt was big news in the papers
- Were you also here in those days?
- Yes
Regarding all that happened from the time
Sudakshana died right up to Daksha's killing ...you are 1 more person who has known everything, right?
Achu'tta
It's impossible that Achu'ttan knows anything more than I do, sir
You can ask me whatever you want to know
Naturally I want to know about Daksha
What was she?
What was her purpose?
I may be able to answerthe 1st question
When my husband Shivadas died in a car accident ...Daksha was 6 years and Sudakshana 12 years old
We were teachers in the same college And in the same department ln spite of being the only daughter of a rich man ...or having a job to sustain myself in life I too fell prey to the illusion that a woman cannot live without the protection of a man
The man who came replacing my husband's post in college replaced my husband in my life also
My miscalculations began
An unscrupulous man who looked at any woman with lustful eyes
The one who should have considered my Sudakshana as his own daughter ...in front of Daksha
Sister!
That day I lost not only Sudakshana but also Daksha
She has never called me mom ever since that incident
3 years later the court let him scot free claiming he was not guilty
When he came out of the court after the judgment
Daksha confronted him with a knife in her hand
Fortunately he escaped that day
Were there any more attempts by Daksha to kill him?
To my knowledge once more
When she was in her 12th grade in a book stall in town
Till her death, did she feel revenge against her step father?
Sorry, I do not know his name Isaac Isaac Pannikar
Did she have feelings of revenge towards Isaac Pannikar?
It only increased everyday lf Daksha was prepared to kill the 1st person she would choose would be Isaac, right?
Yes
How did this Balagangadharan come in?
Why did she feel hatred towards that man?
I do not know, sir
Let alone revenge, I am sure she didn't even know him
This is Daksha's room She spent most of her time in here
- Does this system belong to Daksha?
- Yes
- Can I?
- Please
is there a rock quarry here?
These sounds appear quite frequently lt's about a kilometer away
Before or after her death has anyone else used her computer?
No, this was only used by her
Why sir, any problem?
No, nothing lsn't there anybody else as a help other than Achuthan Nair here?
A lady comes from nearby to cook and household chores
Her husband comes in for odd jobs in the garden
He is a permanent worker at the quarry
What is his name?
Kelu
My hand just broke
I am taking him lf anyone resists, his head will burst and scatter like the rocks you blast
The bomb that killed Balagangadharan and Daksha contained 40% gunpowder
That means it was the local gun powder used to blast the rocks in the quarry I want to know whether you gave only this gun powder to Daksha ...or was it a mixture of aluminum silica and glass powder
A remote controlled bomb that was powerful enough to blast 2 cars
My dear sir, let alone gun powder I haven't given that kid even a sparkler
She was totally mad, sir
And this madness turned violent to which now I appear to be answerable
You nasty dog!
Are you playing with a policeman?
No!
Barson Stop
Kelu
What is it?
This case is not the usual squabble or spurious liquor you are usually accused of
This is murder That too a suicide bombing lf you don't co-operate now ...it won't be the harmless Kerala Police who will interrogate you further lt will be from Delhi
Then you will be labeled a terrorist Pakistani spy etc.
...and be behind bars for life
No!
I'll reveal everything I will tell you whatever I know
Come on, tell
About a week before all this happened I had gone to their place to cut a few banana bunches as per Mr Nair's instructions
Hey!
Isn't it little Daksha?
Why did you pretend not to hear me when I called out to you at the junction?
Did you call me?
When?
Don't try to fool me with that stupid face of yours
Oh!
Forgive me, little one I couldn't come when I was totally drunk
Do you beat up Madhavi after getting drunk?
Of course not, that was in those days Now she is dearerthan life to me
If you give me so much at a time I might get recklessly drunk and beat her up
This is not for that You have to bring me something
What is it, lassie?
Lass, don't let anyone know about this I do have to survive in these parts I don't care who comes to know Neither do I have intentions to inform anyone
Please be careful, little one lt is gun powder
Listening to Kelu's statement and the websites on Daksha's computer ...to make the bomb as well as to plan this crime ...Daksha did not seek anyone's help
This is what we can confirm conclusively
How to make a bomb right up to most modern weapons which we have not even heard of ...are readily available on these websites
A brilliant electronics engineering student like Daksha would've been able to do so easily
Sir!
What happened, Kabir?
Did you enquire?
I did, sir
Akhila Devarajan, Sudha Nair and Ashley Jacob
These were the 3 women in the Balagangadharan molestation case
The 1st two were not only silenced with money ...but also provided top notch jobs in his Dubai and Kochi offices ...and very well taken care of, sir
In short these 2 women wouldn't want even an ant to bite him, right?
Yes, sir
The 3rd one, Ashley Jacob
Balagangadharan's last prey belonged to a poorfamily
Yes, I know a little about that case
Calling her to come for some dance rehearsal and...
Yes, sir
She stood her ground right up to the end in court
But she was stamped a prostitute and lunatic with Balagangadharan's money power
Finally listening to her own uncle change his statement in the witness stand ...she fainted in the court room
Where is she now?
In a convent at Piravom looked after and underthe protection of nuns
Barson
We should find out if Ashley and Daksha are linked in some way I want the telephone number of that convent too
Okay, sir i've come to understand that girl is still mentally very upset
Ashley
This gentleman is here to meet you, dear He has something to ask you
I am Shreeramakrishna I wanted a favor from you
Don't be scared
Do you know this girl Ashley?
Do you remember meeting her somewhere some time?
If you did not know then go ahead and say it, my dear
You can go back to the convent
Didn't I tell you overthe phone she is mentally very disturbed?
She wasn't like this at all She was very smart
After that incident in spite of objections from many sides ...it was her own decision to file a case and call for press meets
She was shattered when her own people turned against her in court lt's alright, Mother I shall find other ways to find out
What happened in the convent today?
Did that girl recognize Daksha?
No, I didn't get a single answer from her
What is your next plan?
There is only 1 more important person in my list
Daksha's proclaimed enemy Her step father Isaac Pannikar
Where is he now?
I found out
Looking after 5 acres of rubber estate which he got as his share
He is now at Kanjirapally We are going there right now
What do you mean 'we' ?
Yes...we You should come with me
But why should I?
Dude, an unofficial visit Just casually, that's all
Papi, this rubber latex is too dilute
That's because the rainwater has seeped into the trees and diluted the milk
Anyway increase it to 6 parts for every sheet
Otherwise the sheets will be very thin and
Varghese will reduce the price drastically
That's true
So what you heard was '2 attempts' ...in a way it is true
Face to face it was only twice
But she used to wander here looking for opportunities
Have you seen her?
I did just once
Stop there!
You!
She probably found out that killing me wasn't that simple
Wasn't that why she found another prey?
Oh!
What if she is dead?
She has become popular, hasn't she?
Let us take leave We will visit again on the way back
Didn't you say you are suffering from back pain?
Yes After a fall from the bike
Warid Master is an expert in medicine His medicines have eased pains forever
Sure, we know that
Okay, carry on Come when you feel like
Sure, we will
What do you think of Isaac Panikkar?
He is a villain to only Daksha and herfamily
On the other hand Balagangadharan was a growing social menace lt was a better deal to kill Balagangadharan who affected ...so many lives in society, than to kill her father
This could possibly be what Daksha thought
Are you saying she forgot the revenge she was carrying within her from when she was 9?
If that was so she should have killed Isaac, isn't it?
Here
Look here be careful lt is slippery here
Do you know them?
No, but looks like a retired school master with his daughter
Great!
To judge a person at one look you are indeed a smart lPS officer
But thank God you didn't say he was the Priest at the Kottayam Church
Why?
Hey lPS fool!
He is Devassy
Kunnamthanam Devassy The most famous 'procurer' in Kottayam town
He is on his way with Isaac's dinner
Then why is he not known in police circles?
Police records do not have a single case against Devassy
Why not haul him up right now?
Great thought Superb idea!
Come here I will explain
Devassy will have all records to show that Isaac is his uncle's son and the girl he brought, his niece and the meeting was a prayer meet
Finally you will be the one who'll stink if you haul him up now
Come dude, let's go
What is it, dude?
Shree, come immediately to the Silk Castle hotel in KK road
What is the matter?
I will tell you when you come You come quickly
It's only less than an hour since the incident occurred
Have they been identified?
Only this one, sir
Who is he?
Sam George Pallath One of the partners of this hotel
Fell from the topmost floor There's a swimming pool up there
There is a witness to this incident An eye witness, staff of this hotel
But no one here has been able to recognize the other guy
No one remembers seeing him here
Sorry, please keep away
Shree
Do you know Sam George?
A little, since he's a well known figure here But that other guy I have definitely seen him somewhere I am not able to place him
Try to remember
No, I am not able to
But there is someone else who'll identify him
Who's that?
I have asked him to come here He'll be here soon
Mila, what else?
- Shree, don't you know Akhil?
- Yes, of course
Akhil's sister is a receptionist in this hotel
This happened when he came to drop her here this morning
What was the likely time you think this would have happened before you arrived?
About 10 minutes before we reached
People were just crowding after hearing the news
Have you got all the pictures?
Yes, almost
We need a couple of snaps of the swimming pool also
Shall we?
Go ahead
This is him
He?
Isn't he the editor of the magazine Mukhapadam
- Yes, Sudharman
-Ah!
Mila
Hello, sir
- ls the body lying there?
- Yes
Let me have a look Side please
Do you have such awful people as friends?
Of course
Right from college I've made some awful friends
Mila success!
This is exactly who we suspected
This Mukhapadam issue is last August
Just look at this, sir
is he actress Sheethal's dad?
Monachan?
Yes All details are in here
But Mila I don't understand what his connection was with Sam
This Monachan had sworn to kill his own wife and brother-in-law
Sir, this is the eye witness I told you about
- What's your name?
- Jomon
What did you see?
When the restaurant work had eased a bit I came up here for a cigarette
Who are you?
What do you want?
Who are you?
I ask you, what do you want?
I want your life I will take it too
Hey!
Get this son of a ***** away instead of standing and gaping there
Don't let go, please Save me
- Was Sam a regular swimmer here?
- Yes, sir
He comes here straight after his exercise
- Have you seen the other guy anytime before?
- No, sir
- Kabir, take his statement and let him go
- Okay, sir
And then?
As a primary assumption, the 2 incidents, death of Balagangadharan and Daksha ...as well as Sam, who died from top of the hotel share many parallel situations
Most important amongst them being, ...both ignored the enemy right in front of their eyes ...while someone totally unknown and without any obvious motive was killed
Daksha's enemy was her step father who destroyed her sister
Monachan's enemy was his wife who encouraged his daughter ...to go afterfame and riches ls this some kind of parallel movement like the old Naxalites did?
Since the murderer also is prepared to die along with his victim, it's a possibility
Will this turn out to be a headache?
Do you have any other details about this Monachan otherthan what appeared in that cheap magazine?
I do, sir
Monachan was a taxi driver at Kuruppanthara bus stand till 2 years ago I got these details from them
All the items are there which the 2 of you wanted
Let there be no shortcomings this Christmas...here, you take this
Whatever paltry sum you get go ahead and splurge it on whatever these kids say
Don't you everthink of tomorrow?
That's exactly why I got them these Fortomorrow lt is Christmas tomorrow
Monachan took care of his wife Lissy and her 2 daughters ...without any hassles in spite of his meager earnings
Monachan's brother-in-law Roy was not on good terms with him
He came one day with a proposal to make Sheethal act ...as a heroine in a music album his friends had set out to make I have explained everything
You better realize, sister that such fortune doesn't come to everyone
My dear Roy, I don't have a problem if her dad agrees
That will depend on the smartness with which mother and daughter handle it
He never lost an opportunity to describe what fame and riches could bring
She just showed her face in one album
Now she is full time in Hyderabad Busy in Telugu
There is no need to think so deeply After all its my brother who says so
That's exactly why I am worried
Look, I am sure he will not involve us in something which will harm us
Does she know anything about acting?
I have confidence in myself, dad
Moreover my team won the 1st prize for the cinematic dance, remember?
Oh yes!
I didn't remember that ln spite of his displeasure in giving in to both mother and daughter's pressure ...he allowed Sheethal to act lf this is going to interfere with her studies ...both mom and daughter will get it from me
Oh aren't you a beautiful girl
A beautiful flower
You are always mine, my friend
Love, I am full of love for you I shall forever be in love with you
First it was just a few albums Then cover photos of some magazines
When nothing further happened Monachan thought ...mother and daughter had quenched theirthirst for acting
But without Monachan's knowledge Lissy and Sheetal were doing the rounds looking for opportunities on shooting locations and hotel rooms
Sheethal did get 1 or 2 small roles in movies
From there she moved to other languages
She got many opportunities since she had no hesitation doing glamour roles
That scene in his movie was great 'Sir' is a genius
Didn't he give her a break?
She didn't have to look back after that
When they got a little better financially
Lissy and Sheethal started ignoring Monachan
- Hey, let me tell you
- No!
Nothing will happen
You dog!
I will kill you
Leave him Have you gone mad?
Yes, I have gone mad You have made me one
- Look brother-in-law, listen to me
- Get lost!
Come on, come lf you commit atrocities in my family I will push this inside you
When Monachan reacted violently on a couple of occasions like a madman ...he became their enemy
Finally Lissy and Sheethal left home
So your decision remains unchanged, is it?
Yes, I will not come anywhere leaving dad alone
Come with me I will not allow you to destroy yourself living with dad
No, leave me
Shikha who had refused to accompany them was forced to go with Roy, another day
Monachan had even complained to the Kaduthuruthy police station
The only result Monachan got out of it was threats he received from Roy and friends
My dear!
Its true I entered movies to clear debts incurred by my dad
I don't ever remember a single day when he was not drunk
He used to beat us after that
He has never spoken a word of love to us
We left home because of his torture
Finally when his daughter started maligning him in public he left his home and town
Have you any clue of Monachan's whereabouts in these last few days?
We heard he was employed as a waiter for some time in some resort at Kovalam
When he returned later to sell his house and land some of his friends gave us a statement that he had threatened to kill Lissy and Roy
So it is only the mode of operation here that is different from the Daksha case
There is yet another reason too, sir
Sam George had the same background as that of Balagangadharan
He had lots of enemies in Hotel business
Event management and Career guidance field lt could be as you say
The beginning of a parallel or something beyond ...all this which we have failed to identify
How long did Monachan and you work together?
About 10 months
Why did your friend do all this?
Did he say anything to you?
No, he was on leave for 2 to 3 weeks He said he was feeling sick
Did anyone come here to meet him?
Friends, relatives?
No sir, we didn't see anyone
But the younger daughter used to often call him on phone
She has even written to him a couple of times I even read one of the letters
What was in it?
That her mom and uncle were trying to force herto act in movies
That he should prevent this
He left saying he would return with her, ...and if he had to, he'd file a case or even kill them
The police are not out to create headaches for others
Whateverthe inconvenience questions will be asked
And information shall be got
What the hell do you want to know?
Why did Monachan do all this?
Are you asking me?
Who else will I ask than the one who has lived 19 years with him?
Look here, actions of some mad people are not answerable by my sister
They are to be investigated by people whom the government nurtures ...with uniform and a cushy salary
He thinks he's a big shot who's come to ask questions!
I want to meet your younger daughter, Shikha
She is not here
She is in a hostel forthe time being
What about Sheethal?
She is at Hyderabad for a photo shoot You cannot meet her right now
You have the age and maturity to answer my questions
But still you are unable to do so lf you interfere in things which don't concern you I will simply say that if yourtongue wags in front of me any more ...I will simply melt down this body which you have sustained with wine and women
You heard me?
I am temporarily ending this meeting between us
But we will meet again
Then not only your daughters but the entire clan of this home will be lined up for my questioning to know whatever I want to know
It happens to be our house Otherwise I would have...
Ashley!
Speak up
Devassy
Kunnamthanam Devassy brought that girl here
I don't want to know the depth and spread of the business you'd been conducting
How did Ashley from Piravom reach Kanjirapally Issac Panikkar's place?
Don't harass me anymore I'll tell you everything
People like me make it a point to earmark girls involved in rape cases
They are much in demand amongst my customers
That's why I went to her house once the case and gossip died down
But she drove me away that day
Unexpectedly 1 day she called me and said she wanted to meet me
What you said the other day was true What does it matter now?
I am so worldly wise in such things
Even though you sent me away my phone # which I wrote on your wall calendar ...has now come of use, isn't it?
That's Devassy!
Now everything is your wish
Businessmen, politicians or even higher officials
You can quote your price And I will get it for you
I called her up for many of my clients All high profile people
But she avoided every one of them stating their bio-data did not please her lt was quite unexpectedly I mentioned Issac to her
She immediately agreed to come ...as if she had been waiting to hear that name from me
That's how I went with her to Issac sir yesterday
- Haven't you gone yet?
- No
How is the stuff?
I just saw a glimpse of her I'll tell you when you come tomorrow
To my knowledge she has come totally of her own accord
Please explain to her that this is one of the most respectable jobs in the world
Sure I will leave and come early morning
Not so early You can come leisurely at around 11 AM
- So that means you are very satisfied
- Get going, man!
When did you know Issac and Ashley were dead?
This morning when I reached his bungalow
The place was full of policemen and people I returned home as soon as I heard what happened lf there is even a single lie in what you have told your final consecration shall be performed here, by me
Understood?
- Kabir
- Sir
Remove the holy attire of this saint and put him under lock-up
He has to appear in court tomorrow
Postmortem report states that Ashley and Issac died of Potassium Cyanide poisoning
The lab tests clearly confirms presence of Potassium Cyanide ...in this lip gloss found lying in the room
Ashley went from the convent to her house for a few days
Her activities during this period is clear from Devassy's statement
But what she did later we can only assume since there are no witnesses to that
What is your assumption as an investigating officer?
I will tell you, sir
That Devassy has gone finally What trouble I had sending him away!
Why all this preparation?
Does beauty like yours need make-up?
A girl who takes her enemy's life with poison applied on her lips
This may sound good in stories and novels But not in real life lt is difficult to believe this
But although this is only an assumption I have other reasons to substantiate this
The postmortem report states that Issac ...and Ashley did not have any physical relationship
Not only that Devassy took Ashley to Issac's house after 6:00 P.M
Death has occurred between 6:30 and 7:00 P.M
That means they died half an hour after Devassy left
There are no visible evidences of a struggle or violence in the room
Didn't you ask me a little while ago if there could be a girl like this?
Yes, I did
This is where l have to link this case with 2 other deaths that occurred recently
The modus operandi is different But 2 incidents with parallel similarities
Balagangadharan
- Daksha Monachan
- Sam George, both suicides
Probably this format is 1st of its kind the world over
A revenge fulfilled by exchanging their enemies
To avenge Ashley Daksha finished Balagangadharan
While Daksha was avenged by Ashley by doing away with Issac lf we follow this pattern of thought Sam George
- Monachan end in another lead
This is Monachan's wife Lissy And Roy his brother-in-law
They were Monachan's enemies
He had often told his friends and openly threatened that he would kill them
But they are still alive today
Probably like Issac lived a few days more after Daksha's death
- Does it mean this series will see more...?
- Yes, Sir
Though we do not have evidences we are forced to think like that
Going by your theory, they will be killed by Sam George's enemies, isn't it?
Exactly, sir
And only if we find that person and catch him alive ...we will be able to know why this pattern was followed
And probably know how many more are involved in it
But before that we need to know something else
No, sir
The day after tomorrow
Really, without fail, sir lt's that Reddy He has fixed a song shoot on 15th and 16th I don't know what will happen
What's happening, sir?
It's been quite some time Will it be over now?
They will let you know when it's over
This is that ASP's way of getting back at us
Did mom and uncle know your dad was visiting you at school?
No, dad specifically asked me not to let them know
Do you remember writing a letter asking your dad to rescue you from your uncle and mom who were forcing you to act in movies?
Yes, I do
Did dad come and meet you after that?
Yes, he did
He said he was going to file a case to rescue me
And said he had retained a good lawyerfor that, but...
What is it, my dear?
What happened?
You can tell us everything No one will know what you told us
Be brave
That day dad came to meet me at night
Daddy my foot!
How is he planning to take care of you?
Look, I am not willing to allow my daughter to live like a servant maid to anyone I have never allowed you or the girls to exist like servant maids all these years lf she comes with me now she will have a more dignified life
...than what you are giving her
Then go ahead and take her
But before that Your lawyer wants to talk to you
Monacha, this case does not appear to be what it was when we discussed it this morning
Later having thought over it I realize whatever the arguments we provide the court will finally order that being a minor she should be sent with her mom
So Monachan you better listen and do as Roy says
You blackguard!
Are you advising me after treating yourself to his liquor?
I will...
No need for histrionics here lf you are planning to proceed like this the judge will be the next one to offer you the same advice
Remember that
Law and justice in this land is only forthe rich and powerful
No!
There is someone called God beyond all this
And if HE also fails me I know what to do I will take my daughter away Even if I have to kill all of you
You will kill, is it?
Dad
Leave him
My dear?
So your dad hated your mom the most, didn't he?
No, in spite of all this he could never hate her
Dad used to say that Roy uncle was responsible for all this
That only if Roy uncle left our lives we'd lead a peaceful life
You can all leave now
We will ask you to come again if necessary
Have you got whatever you wanted?
A little The rest of it will come to us by and by
You can go now
Come
Shikha, go bravely No one is going to force you to act in films
Come, let's leave
If our assumptions are right the next attempt will be on Roy, isn't it?
Yes And that too within few days
But from where?
I don't know
Maybe from a person who has been cruelly denied justice
He will be the one to kill Roy To find out who that is we have to go into the past of Sam George
Sir
Achankunju
Yes, sir All know me as Poyilakunju
What was the problem between you and Sam George?
We did not have any specific problem
The why did Sam register a complaint against you at Chingavanam station?
He stated that you stopped him on the way ...spoke obscenities and tried to attack him etc
Sethu, an old friend of Sam was very close to me I knew Sam only through him I could not bear his atrocities against Sethu That's why I did all that
What atrocities?
What did Sam George do to Sethu?
This Sam George Pallath had a past which was not as glamorous as it is now
Sethu on the basis of friendship took Sam who was jobless to Kottayam ...and gave him a position in his own establishment
He later became a shareholder Sethu believed in him blindly
But Sam was only taking advantage of him
Notjust Sethu's hard earned wealth and business
But his one and only sistertoo with fake love and false promises had been taken over by Sam and his friends which Sethu came to know very late
By then everything was lost including his sister's life
Sam was very clever
He trapped Sethu in a legal case for cheating and attempted murder
Throwing plenty of money around got him sentenced by the court 3 years of imprisonment lt was only recently he was released
When I heard Sam was killed I 1st thought it was Sethu
Did Sethu come to meet you after his release?
Yes, he did
He asked me for some money which I gave him
Where is he residing?
When he came to see me he was staying somewhere near lllickal
Later I heard he'd moved from there Now I have no idea where he is
Now you can go, Achankunju I will send word if I need you again
Also, if ever you see Sethu again call and inform us immediately
- Okay
- Don't nurse any sentiments forthat
Sethu Sethunathan
It was Chief Inspector Chandrashekar who investigated this case those days
Everyone says his investigation file is like reading a crime thriller
He includes every bit of information in it
This is also a routine with him
He always collects and files newspaper reports about the case he investigates
Most of them will be single column
What is it, sir?
Like you said, Barson
Most newspaper reports were fillers in the inner pages
But for this
This is entirely different The investigating officer has noted it also
When all other reports were similar why did this alone show a different pattern?
But sir, this is an evening paper
Spark I too know the genuineness of evening paper reports
But here it reports the exact information which Achankunju told us
That means this reporter Anirudhan knew Sethunathan as closely as Achankunju did
We have to find this Anirudhan For that...
Hello What is it, dude?
I am in the middle of reporting the state youth festival
What?
Spark?
Yes, an evening paper Anirudhan, I want details about him
Dude, we are just 2 of us covering the events of 5 states I will enquire once this is over
One thing I am sure There is no paper called Spark in Kerala now
Sir, Sub Inspector Kabir on line I am at Roy's house
His wife says he went out this morning But does not know where he went or why
No sir, the driver was there with him I tried calling them
Roy's phone is switched off And the driver is not picking up the call
Okay sir, I will do so
Where the hell has this rascal gone after switching off his phone?
!
People think and do weird stuff not knowing their end is near!
Its only to save him from mishap I am asking you all this
What she says is true, sir He left this morning without telling us
Get off!
He is Roy's driver, sir Roy left with him this morning
Now where did you pick him up from?
He was inside Karthika Bar I lifted him from there
Where is Roy?
He has gone somewhere with someone
Where and with whom?
Somewhere with someone
You dirty pig!
You will not utter anything more, is it?
Let me go sir, I will tell you Let go
Roy has gone to fix an estate deal To Mundakayam
Alone?
No, there was an agent too I was instructed not to let anyone know
Especially Lissy ma'am
Did you hear him?
Your dear little brother is busy buying up lands for himself ...without the knowledge of his precious sister
Being the wife of taxi driver Monachan and if you have even an iota of compassion think again, was everything you gained truly worthwhile?
Who was this agent with Roy?
I really don't know anything about him except that I can recognize him again
Not even his name ls it him?
To tell you the truth I don't have enough money for all this
But if the price is what you quoted it would be a bargain whichever way lf it works out I will treat this as a good hunt
It will happen, sir
As we go along I will make sure it happens Just wait and see
Outsiders don't find anything wrong with us
A famous actress and her uncle's manager
But only we know our true situation
- What is wrong with your situation now?
- Oh a great lot
Ever since brother-in-law died my sister talks to me differently
As if she regrets all this now
Yes really, and these days that girl's movies have all flopped
Now all my hopes are pinned on the younger one
But she is unreachable
Let all this die down I know what to do
You will not do any darn thing!
Your goodbye to your wife today was not to return but a '1 way' journey
What the hell do you mean?
Are you drunk?
Hey!
Stop the vehicle, Sethu
No, this vehicle will not stop where you ask me to
This is going straight to the edge of Kollikokka
From there the 2 of us will fly in this jeep to the world of dead
Stop the vehicle
Stop
Sethu...no
Sethu...don't
Sethu...stop
Let me go
Let me go
Sethu...
listen
Don't stop me
- Tell me, you dog!
- Never, Sir I have suffered much more than all this That too for a crime I never committed
Let me see if I can make you talk
Tell me
Not even if you kill me will I utter a word I have no intention of telling you
Tell me, is Roy the last one in this series?
No, I will not
Tell me how you knew Daksha, Ashley and Monachan?
No, I will not tell
Tell me Tell me you dirty...
No No, will not tell
Have you gone mad?
If this guy dies who will answer for it?
Anyway he was intending to die Let him die and I will answer
He has to be...
You come here Come here I say!
Hey sir!
- Me?
- No the younger one
Go Go with a prayer
Whateverthe provocation no more of your manhandling
- This is my order
- Sir
I will tell you the truth, brother
Go on Tell all
To the blindfold law of this land Sethunathan offers his alms lf you have anything to say come on out with it you...!
Hey!
Don't rush me, sir when I am being generous
Didn't you ask me a little while ago if Roy was the last in this series?
He is not
Among all these there is 1 more which we consider most important 1 more remaining The 5th and final
Who is that?
Advocate Narayanan Thambi lf you investigate you will know
His death will be the biggestjustice among all the otherjust acts we did
Now I am going to challenge you, brother if you are true and straightforward
Go, find out who will kill Thambi And prevent that killing
You!
He is a tough guy
He is not going to talk with punches and blows
Let's wait lf all fails we'll use scientific methods like Narco
Moreoverthat's fashion too these days
Sir, you are talking without realizing the seriousness of this situation
For Sethu to be subjected to any kind of scientific test ...in today's situation with the court's approval it takes at least 10 days lf this series of murders does not end with Sethu... the next attempt will occur immediately
Especially since Sethu is alive and already in our hands
What shall we do now?
Sir, do you know advocate Narayanan Thambi?
Of course!
Very well!
There used to be a story that with Rs 501 and advocate Ramankutty's help ...anybody could kill anyone he chose
Narayanan Thambi is a modern version of that instead of 501 he charges Rs 5 lakh per sitting
He did not deal with murder instead he preferred rape and assault of women ln short he is the most poisonous among the lot
You could say that!
I want to see Narayanan Thambi at his best performance
Your Honor
My client has suffered this horrible experience from her own teacher whom she respects and idolizes which is most shocking
Hence the culprit should be given the most severe punishment that law allows
This is my humble request to the Honorable court
Any questions to ask Mr Narayanan Thambi?
Yes, Your Honor
Niya Punnoose
Yes, sir
What subject did Prof. Alex Zachariah teach?
Zoology
That means animal science
Yes
Zoology is a branch that deals in detail about sexual and reproductive aspects ...of all living beings including human beings lsn't that right?
Correct
Which means that compared to other subjects this is a little spicy
When we were in college our science batch mates used to say... lf a male came to teach zoology the girls never cut classes
And the boys never did if it was a lady teacher
Tell me Niya, did you feel that way when Alex taught you?
No, I never did
Lies!
It is clear from herface that Niya is lying I object, Your Honor
My client is being subjected to unnecessary questions
They are not unnecessary I will prove it to you
How can you prove it?
That's my duty
You don't worry about that
With the court's permission
This is a recent lab report of a sex hormone analysis performed on Niya
Estrogen, the female hormone count ranges normally between 25-221 in an 18 year old girl
But according to this Niya's is 262 which is way beyond normal
So we can say that she is a confirmed nymphomaniac?
I can call upon some real life examples too, your honor
Do you know Sabu who is standing there?
- Yes
- How?
I used to go to school in his car
-Alone?
- No, with other students
So Sabu, you have known this girl right from childhood right?
Yes, sir
She started travelling in my car from when she was in the 2nd or 3rd grade
Those days she was a very sweet kid
But when she reached the 8th and 9th grade...
Continue...
When she reached 8th and 9th her behaviorto other kids was not quite normal
Especially to the boys
A little abnormal touch here and there
When I realized her nature I stopped letting her travel in my car
Afterthat whenever she sees me she turns herface away and walks off
Vivek
Yes
- How do you know Niya?
- We studied together in the 12th grade
- Together, you mean in the same grade?
- Yes
Was the relationship between the 2 of you usual like other classmates?
No We were in love
What is this, Niya?
is he telling the truth?
Tell me, is it true?
He claims he has plenty of love letters and greeting cards apparently sent by you
It's true that I was in love with him Once upon a time
Okay, that's enough for me
Vivek also said only that
Then how did your relationship break up?
I sincerely loved her I wanted to marry her also
But that was not her concept of love
She has openly told me that she cannot stick to a single man in her whole life
Not only that I have seen her many times with my friends in compromising situations
No!
He's lying
He was the one who cheated on our love
Did you see, a single day's arguments and her fans have increased multifold?
It's all due to your cleverness So I'll be acquitted, won't I counsel?
Don't worry We will fix everything
That's enough for me
- Excuse me?
- Yes?
I am Shreeramakrishnan I am Asst. Superintendent of Police, I want to talk to you personally
So that's the issue
My dear ASP sir, it's been 30 years since I have been donning this robe ln 1985, I started my career appearing forthe defendant in the Mundakayam women flesh trade case
There has been no dearth of threats and obscenities leveled at me ever since
Many famous organizations have several times threatened to finish me
But none has managed to touch even a single strand of hair on me 4 murders have occurred in this series All well planned and executed
The 5th we heard was your name lt is our duty to rightfully inform you
Okay, but that will not get me to hide indoors or run away I am not prepared to alter any of my daily routine
The Kerala Police have no particular ambition to see that Adv. Narayanan Thambi dies only after he sees a 1000 full moons!
But our ambition is to prevent another murder in a series of murders that has made the law in this land run around in circles
30 years 30 years which includes the cases of Issac Panikkar and Sudakshana
More than 50 cases which created an uproar
Most of them big victories making the opponents helpless
This is the history of advocate Narayanan Thambi's career
Where shall we begin now, sir?
I have made a list of suspicious people from the cases Thambi had won
We will divide that list into 3
And 3 of us will investigate in 3 different directions
For example, this contains details of a Krishnamurthy murder case which Narayanan Thambi had argued and won
Krishnamurthy, an engineering student ragged by his seniors and killed was the case
Krishnamurthy's brother Ramanujam is specially mentioned here
He has tried to assault the defendant as well as lawyer Thambi many times ...during and after the case
Where is Ramanujam today and what does he do?
Whether he still nurses his old feeling of hatred towards Thambi should be the nature of our investigation
You have to note that we have only assumptions to help us
Therefore we may have to pay a heavy price even for small lapses
I considerthese enemies and murderthreats only as a part of my profession
You cannot put the blame entirely on your profession, counsel I have seen your career history
The last 30 years have never seen you arguing on behalf of justice
You derive great pleasure in breaking justice and fooling the law
Like a born criminal
Call and let me know anything that's suspicious
Sir, I met Krishnamurthy's brother, Ramanujam
He is a priest at Bhagavathy temple in Thekkekara
No, sir i did not find anything suspicious
Okay, then leave him and go to the next
Mary Paulose
Born: 06 - 05 -1950 Died: 08 - 05 -1989
Paulose Chandy
Born: 04 - 05 - 1927 Died: 12 - 08 - 1987
Hello
Shree, remember you asked me about that reporterAnirudhan?
Dude, reporter of that evening paper I have got information about him When will you be free?
I...that is...
I will call you back this evening
Why did you decide to meet here?
Did you meet any of our old friends on the way?
No I will explain
We had been looking out for advocate Narayanan Thambi's enemies ...through 3 different routes Barson, Kabir and I
We met many people I went after the 1st case Thambi handled and won, the Mundakayam case
An incident that happened in 1980 where a 20 year old girl, Mary Paulose ...with promises of a governmentjob was lured to the guest house and molested including a political leader of those days there were 19 others who were accused
Within a few days after the judgment, Mary died
Soon after that her mom and dad died
When I reached the Mundakayam Parish all I could see were their tombstones
But the Rev. Father from his memories gave me some information
Mary became pregnant And she delivered while the case went on I went in search of Mary's son and it took me to Kanyagiri orphanage
From there to St. Aloysius School where he studied till his 10th grade
To know who that boy was I had to come to this campus
That too to this classroom where he studied
Tell me, isn't it you?
Mary gave birth to you without knowing who the father was?
Shree, I... I prayed till this second that the name Milan Paul I found in the orphanage school and college records was not yours
It was in this classroom that I 1st met you
Here that we became friends
And when I came to know, you were an orphan loved you more than a mere friend ln spite of all this, you...you...
Shree please listen to what I have to say, too
What can you say?
That you are not Milan Paul?
No!
The name you saw in those records is mine indeed
The newspapers and people of this land called Mary Paulose by a pet name...
The 'Mundakayam girl' and I am her son
Like you mentioned a short while ago an illegitimate son
Enough!
Now I need to know just one more detail
The 5th murderer who is out to kill Advocate Narayanan Thambi, is it you?
Yes
So all along, being my friend you had been betraying me, weren't you?
No, Shree I can look unwaveringly at your face and say that I have never betrayed you I came here to confess
Even though I was aware that you already knew everything
A confession when you know you are cornered, isn't it?
You can give it any explanation You can call me cruel or a cheater
But only after you listen to what I have to say
Like you said, I was conceived after my mother was raped by 19 people
She gave birth to me between arguments when Kerala was celebrating its 1st rape case
My childhood were filled with images of khaki uniforms and black robes
We slept and ate in the corridors of the court building
You gave in to them willingly
You deliberately cheated with intentions of blackmail
When self respect was trampled and torn to shreds within court rooms for the 1st time I realized the pain of such women, ...through the cries of my mother which even today follows me
Narayanan Thambi's brilliant performance set free all the defendants
My mother lived for only 2 more months after that
My grandpa and grandma were laborers in an estate nearby l became a burden to them since they were unable to earn enough as laborers
Some politicians advised them to use me to perform an agitation in front of the secretariat to gain some pity from the government
Indefinite period agitation 7th day
We did not gain any pity But felt the heat of a policeman's beating
After that incident grandpa died And soon after grandma too followed him
That's how I reached the Kanyagiri orphanage
Probably my ability to study prompted the warden ...to send me to St Aloysius school
With friends and study routine I slowly forgot the past
Not only that, I found a girl friend to whom I could confide everything I still do not know what my feelings were for that girl with eyes full of wonder
One day after class she went home never to return
Do you know Shree who that girl was who died after cruelly being raped?
Sudakshana
Daksha's?
Yes, Daksha's older sister
When I went around, laughing and talking with you in this campus ...the wounds within me had not healed I did not tell you anything maintaining the orphan image I had
One day...
Stop!
Stop man
- Can you give me a lift?
- Come, sit
- lsn't it Daksha?
- Yes
Do you recognize me?
I am Milan
No need for explanations I know you
Then why did you ignore me all the times we met before?
I never felt like meeting you
You go file a case for that
Hey stop!
What is this, Daksha?
What happened?
I lost my car keys
Where?
I don't know
- l don't know anything
- Why are you doing this Daksha?
Why are you destroying yourself?
What else can I do?
Today also I tried to kill him
- Who?
- Him!
That man who is the 2nd husband of the lady who calls herself my mom
That man who killed my sister I'll kill him
To me this was new information
That she was full of revenge even after 14 years
Also I realized a truth within me that I was trying to run away from the same kind of pain Daksha was going through
The pain of those who had been denied justice
What about Sethu, Ashley and Monachan?
I will explain
That was the time when Balagangadharan-Ashley case was going on I was the one who reported that case I met Ashley I 1st met Monachan in a hotel room
I had gone there to interview the famous painter Mohammed Ali
Who are you?
What do you want?
I think I mistook my room...
Go!
Go away!
About an hour later I left Mohammed Ali's room
When I reached the other room I saw...
So you reported about Sethu under the name of Anirudh?
Yes
When I reported controversial issues I used the pen name Anirudh
When did you 1st reach this decision?
To exchange revenge seeking victims in the first 4 murders
To us this was notjust revenge lt was our way to ridicule
Our ridicule of the law and justice which is apparently said to exist here
We were not prepared to live afterfinishing off our enemies
So we decided to die along with our enemy
Shree, I have not betrayed you like you think after being with you as yourfriend
Neither have I used any information you had told me as part of your investigation I have helped you in spite of my being part of all that
May be
But in this situation I can never be a friend to you
You have gone far beyond my reach to help you in any way, Mila
You have to go with them
You have to confess all what you told me in front of the law
You do not have any other option
Let's go, sir
This is my office bike
Can I make a call asking them to pick it up?
Mila!
No!
Mila don't!
What the hell did you do?
You let him escape from gunpoint I know the reason Friendship!
He played all these games hiding in the shadow of friendship I am sure he was exploiting your friendship I don't think so, sir
What?
!
If so, he could easily have misled me in many phases of this investigation
But in spite of knowing I was getting closer to the truth he never misled me, sir
So you still stick to yourtheory
Well, I am not saying anything more
But I am warning you if anything happens to advocate Thambi ...through this friendship you will be the only one answerable
No, sir
As a subordinate officer to you and as a friend to Milan I give you my word
Neither advocate Thambi nor anybody else will be killed by Milan Paul
- Hello
- This is Shree
Mila, you are going deeper into danger You have to back out of this
No Shree, I cannot do it
Because now it is not revenge, it is duty
Mila, nothing is going to change here just because you killed Narayanan Thambi
When one is felled 9 others will rise up I know
With plenty of money and a Narayanan Thambi to rescue lf the man who sets out to disrobe a woman is stopped, that's enough for me lf l am able to kill him, like the others I will not give up my life, Shree
I will surrender That too to you I am very sure you will surrenderto me
But that will not be after you kill the advocate
It's probably because he's the son of an old revolutionary ...that Akhil understood me and was willing to bring you here
But everyone need not feel the same
After hearing about me what do you think, Niya?
Anyone in my situation will wish what you have done
Tell me How can I help you?
If I guess right, Narayanan Thambi would have made a call by now ...for a compromise meeting
Yes
He called 2 days back regarding this
But I was very rude to him
Don't be rude, hereafter
You should call and tell him that on the 17th of this month ...at the suite in Hotel Imperial you're ready for a meeting to compromise
This is the safest way I can reach advocate Narayanan Thambi
The former Supreme court judge Cyriac Mampully facing charges ...for accumulation of unaccounted riches is being ...accorded a reception here by some lawyers ...on the 17th of this month at the Hotel Imperial suite
Adv. Narayanan Thambi is head of the reception committee
Mila, this will be dangerous I heard that some lawyers and few organizations ...are planning to stage a protest on this same day
Akhil, I know this I also know that, from the Superintendent of Police ...all police officers will be there in front of that hotel
That is why I selected this function to be held on the 1 7th
On that day all eyes will be on the demonstrators ...and former Supreme courtjudge
Except for 1 person
Except forthe eyes of 1 man
We shall be victorious in this attempt if we give him the slip
Why are you doing this?
Are you standing and enjoying this?
Look, our chief guest will arrive here in 10 minutes lf anything happens to him...
You should have seen to that
More than the chief guest and this function the police are more concerned now ...to avoid a confrontation here
- Hello
- Hello, I am Niya
Tell me, Niya I am near the hotel
The place is full of police and problems That is why I did not come there
That's good I will try to make myself free as soon as possible I will wait for you
There is a construction site behind the hotel, I'll be there
Okay
The situation is very bad here, sir
So?
Do you want me to return fearing them?
No, never sir
We have enough forces right now to chase them away
But if a lathi charge takes place now its repercussions will be on you, sir ln your present situation it will...
Sir, please you have to go back
Driver, turn the vehicle around
Niya I am inside the construction site nearthe hotel
Where are you, Niya?
Hello, Niya?
Can you hear me?
Who are you?
Why are you doing this to me?
You know me Yes, you do
The son of a woman you killed and buried ...several times with that tongue of yours
Mary Paulose's son
The only 1 in this world who has the most legitimate right to finish you
Mila, don't do it
Leave me, Shree
Listen to me
Leave me
Hey you!
Mila, free him
Leave me
Mila, no don't
Mila, leave him
Mila, leave him I want you...
No!
Mila!
Subtitled by latha and rekhs
If one day, we are really far away from each other, will you come when I need you?
Hello, my name is Lee Feng-Hsin.
They all call me Captain Lee here.
Ms. Blue, here is the thing.
D0 you still remember what happened yesterday?
Not only did the incident get out of control, it was quite costly for some corporations.
D0 you know this person in there?
I don't think so.
But the telecommunication police report shows that you and him have exchanged data.
So it doesn't convince me that you two only met online.
His name is Yen Cheng-Yu.
Also known as King, a well-known hacker.
Ms. Blue, we suspect you bribed King into hacking corporate computers and stealing confidential info to use as sources for your news column.
So?
Nothing, Ijust thought...
This thing you did with him could be rather severe.
It's not funny at all.
So you shouldn't be laughing.
Ms. Blue, I am trying to help you.
If you still don't cooperate, there is nothing else I can do.
But you don't seem like those dirty reporters who like to invade others' privacy.
As to what kind of person you are, it all depends on your attitude.
I already quit my job.
All these to me are not for the news.
Captain Lee, have you heard of BBS?
BBS?
BBS, the Bulletin Board System, developed only among the students in its early stage.
In order to compete with those popular foreign forums, someone integrated all BBS systems to include instant message posting, user-friendly interfaces, and a variety of navigating methods, which made it the most used Internet forum among young adults.
Those users who were students are now in their various career stages.
Nobody knows how BBS became the most popular Internet forum.
But surely enough, many people just want to be a by-standing Villager.
A Villager?
Well, BBS users like to call themselves the Villagers, or the Crowd.
Just like those bystanders... in Stephen Chow's movies.
How are they related to the incident yesterday?
Reporters now are getting worse!
I told you to go online and find some news to just copy and paste.
Why is it so hard?
See here how people came up with such great headlines.
Renowned hacker disclosed the ambulance blocker.
Villagers hailed Justice of the Crowd!
If you all still can't produce good shit, you are fired.
Get lost!
Back so soon?
Yeah.
This is the article for today's interview.
Oh come on, Ms. Blue.
What kind of headline is this?
Since when can an old lady selling vegetables make headline?
We are not Discovery channel.
Readers today only want juicy topics.
It shouldn't be too hard for you with all the oversea experiences to write a decent online article.
Should it?
But boss, aren't there others doing that already?
Others?
You mean those idiots outside?
I told them to dig some dirt from the number one online forum, none could do it.
You can start looking for news on BBS today too.
Due tomorrow.
Hi, I am a reporter from Thunder Newspaper.
D0 you know where can I find the board for news?
Huh?
Did you come to the wrong place?
Wrong place?
Am I not in BBS already?
Yes yes... you are, but I... um...
Would you mind showing me the way?
This is my first time visiting.
Show you the way?
Yeah, like taking me to the News Board and I will go from there.
Ok, sure.
Right this way, dear reporter.
How come I feel... it's getting less crowded now?
Weren't there more people in the Gossip Board?
First time visitor like you have to check-in here first.
Where am I?
Welcome to the Hate Board!
A board that let you vent out your hatred.
Go to hell...
Fucker...
Hey everyone, here comes a rare visitor.
A reporter!
Hi...
How's everyone?
A newbie.
Fuck!
Reporter again!
Got no more news to copy?
Which station?
She hot?
Hmm...
Where are the news?
In BBS... there are no news.
You are the news!
Wanna run?
I felt like crap today.
I hate seeing you bunch of stupid reporters trying to get news from BBS!
Which TV station?
Which newspaper?
Speak!
You deaf?
We'll show you newbies some manners!
Who are you?
Woodman.
You...
Stay back.
What do you want?
Thank you.
May I ask who you are?
Here is not where you belong.
(Your account has been locked)
What's going on?
BBS users don't welcome reporter right?
Unless you know this group really well and speak their language, it's not likely you will find anything there.
So this BBS forum is where this whole thing started.
What about the Woodman you mentioned earlier have to do with this?
The centre of the story involves this girl named Li Cheng-Xiang.
Everything began with BBS.
(Central Hospital)
(You have private messages)
(You have 23 unread mails)
(9527 Li Cheng-Xiang)
(Automatic Message Management:
Turn Off)
(Dream Board)
Hey girl, check this.
Ha, isn't this picture funny?
Totally, who came up with that pose?
I think it's Stupid Clown Board master.
Ha...
I didn't get to go this time...
When is the next gathering for the board masters?
After your surgery.
Hope everything goes well...
It will for sure!
Don't forget you are the one supposed to create Purple-Hype.
Don't make fun of me.
Besides, no one would remember the stupid things I said that day.
Did you forget it's all recorded by Moderator?
Ha.
But...
Um... nothing.
Did you tell King that you are in the hospital?
Are you 0k?
It's 0k if you don't want to talk about it.
You are such a gossiper.
Hey, I care a lot about you, all right.
It's a S.E.C.R.E.T.
See, you're doing it again.
Left me hanging.
Ha ha.
Let me kick some morons' asses.
Anyways, just write down whatever.
I will go look.
Man!
This girl is so hot!
Which one?
This one, this one.
Wow... one of a kind!
Mean!
Damn right mean!
How do you know she is mean?
Geez...
Show him, show him.
Mean means
Big Boobie!
I thought was something good.
Let me tell you.
There are three Beauty Board masters.
That one is Miss C...
C Cup.
The second one is MM.
M Cup...
Oh my god!
How is M possible?
Maybe the butt?
You so sick.
Geez...
S0 sexy.
I think Miss C and MM are both this pretty.
D0 all board masters have to be really pretty?
Of course.
I heard there is a third one.
This one called JusticeGirl.
How come there is no picture?
Yeah, no one knows.
Let me look her up.
Beauty Board gossipers are the best at that.
Answer is coming!
(User GY978 Access Suspended for 1 Week)
Xiang, you still there?
I am going to class.
Talk to you later.
Ok, should be working now.
Wow...
Handsome boy, how old are you?
Girlfriend?
Young people don't blind date anymore.
They like to meet accidentally and fall in love.
What are you guys talking about?
Sound happy.
Xiang, we are trying to introduce some girls for this computer engineer.
Computer engineer!
Awesome!
My computer is acting weird recently.
Would you please take a look?
I'm about to go.
Please.
It will only take a minute.
It's going to be fast.
It's right here.
Thank you!
Please come in.
My computer is very slow.
Something is wrong.
Help me take a look.
Ok.
Is this your boyfriend, King the Hacker?
Ex-Boyfriend.
He... he is super famous.
He is like the God in Taiwan hackers' world.
A few days ago I...
Can we not talk about this?
Sorry.
It's 0k.
Why does the course enrollment system suck so much?
Shit!
Why did I miss the class again?
What's up with these boys?
How can they be so noisy even when picking a class?
Damn, I am screwed.
Hey girl...
WY are you crying?
I have to work part-time at nights to pay off student loans, but all my classes have a schedule conflict.
I can't graduate on time if this goes on.
What can I do?
Whose class you want?
Mr. Lin's 3D Basic Animation.
I heard his class is very chill.
I thought that would be easier for me to work part-time, but I can't get even get in.
I am so screwed...
It's 0k, I think I got in.
I will give you my spot, 0k?
ReaHy?
Yeah...
Thanks Xiang!
N0 worries.
I am going to drop out now so you can select it right away.
Ok, on the count of three.
One, two, three.
Why?
Why can't I select it?
I thought I dropped out?
This sucks so bad!
Can you two stop whining?
Whose class you want?
Mr. Lin's... 3D Basic Animation.
Move over.
Why are you guys taking such a boring class?
Is this real?
Wow... this is amazing!
Li.
Cheng.
Xiang.
What's your name?
Call me King, that's what people call me on the Internet.
So, where is your Queen?
It's done.
I will restart for you.
Wait...
I haven't replied my BBS messages.
Excuse me.
BBS?
Yeah.
What is that?
It's a great Internet forum.
You can come to Dream Board to post.
I am the board master of Dream Board.
Dream Board...
A place for interpreting dreams?
N0...
It's more of a place for people to cheer each other up.
A board for people who want to work hard for their dreams.
Sounds very good.
So... did yours come true?
What?
Your dreams.
Not yet.
Anyway, I hope you can drop a line there when you're free.
Ok, I Will.
Your computer should be fine after you restart it.
Time to go.
Ok, thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye.
BYE bye.
(Security System Initiated)
Who are you?
Forum admin?
I don't need to answer... a hacker.
Interesting.
ID King, why are you here?
I don't need to answer you.
Take this.
(Go to your interview)
(Hurry UP)
(It's time for the interview)
You just wait!
I am screwed by my own written program.
Ok...
I am coming...
Four Square is the world's most prominent system security maintenance company.
We are now hiring system maintenance engineer, computer programmer and cloud-computing developer.
Welcome.
Interviewees please report to the front desk for check-ins,
Thank you.
Hi.
You are King, right?
The star in the hacker world.
Nice to finally meet you again.
Much obliged, thank you.
D0 I know you?
We were in a competition before.
My name is Huang Kuan-Chun,
ID Mimic.
D0 you still remember me?
Mimic?
Sorry, I don't recall.
It's 0k, it's been awhile anyway.
I am the system security engineer at this company.
How about you?
Why do you want to come here for interview?
Where did you work before?
Actually I'm...
I got it!
Hackers like to hide their tracks, right?
Yeah...
Don't worry, for someone as famous as you, you will get hired no matter where you go.
Yen Cheng-Yu.
Hey, they are calling you.
Yes!
Good luck.
Thanks, nice to meet you.
Same here.
Wait.
My name is Yen Cheng-Yu.
English name is King.
I am applying for the computer programmer position.
You did remarkably well on the hiring test and provided an outstanding portfolio.
I personally admire your talents.
Not to mention I'm also impressed with your performance.
However... we are a little worried about your experience as a hacker.
As you know, our industry is very scared of hackers, especially with your reputation 0n the Internet.
I am afraid that will have a negative impact on our corporate image.
I apologize.
I really do.
Miss, the manager upstairs wants you to copy something.
Who?
Manager Wang upstairs.
I need someone here though.
I will be here while you're away.
Ok.
Scared of hackers?
Very interesting.
Moderator, I am here.
Any new commands?
Recently, there is a new account name Queen, who is constantly spreading private posts and videos of forum admins.
I hope you can help me investigate.
The legendary phenomenon in BBS...
Purple-Hype.
Is that a problem?
I took this video at the gathering of board masters.
I only sent the file to one master named Li Cheng-Xiang.
If the video did not leak out...
Xiang could be the Queen.
What are her intentions?
I don't know.
Board masters come and go year after year.
Everyone has their own expectations for BBS.
Xiang mentioned at the gathering to let BBS "Purple-Hype".
I hope she isn't doing it by extreme means.
"Purple-Hype"?
There are thousands of discussion boards within BBS System.
People with all hobbies will find their kinds here.
More than ten million users logged on each clay.
The system can hold up to one million users online simultaneously.
If 90% of the users are all in one board, there will be a Popularity Signal...
"Purple-Hype"-
But BBS has never had a "Purple-Hype" level incident.
After all, people come here for different purposes.
Let me report two things.
First, there is a hacker King, who keeps trying to break in here.
Second, reporters have been roaming in BBS.
If this incident got 0n the news,
I don't think it's a good thing.
Did King come for troubles again?
This site still has the most solid System Wizard.
N0 way can he just make it in here.
As far as the reporter goes,
I see it differently.
BBS has always been a place for people to find news, but none has been worthy of reporting.
Mainly because the forum admins and board masters will instantly block any posts that might create chaos.
But if we do have real incidents that will truly affect BBS,
I do hope the reporters can help bringing up those hidden issues for everyone to examine.
What kind of issues?
Human search engine, cyber bullying, anonymity culture, and so on...
So I think reporters can help BBS in some ways.
But for those insignificant matters,
I do not want them to over analyze.
Now, I want you to look into this Queen and try to steal anything from her.
We should be able to identify her IP address.
If the address matches the one in Central Hospital, then Xiang is the Queen.
Let's hope...
She is not...
Cheng-Xiang, I am Dr. Lin.
Please come in.
Cheng-Xiang.
How are you?
Feeling sick today?
N0.
Did your cough get better?
Yes.
BBS!
People still play that now?
Dr. Lin, you played BBS too?
I used to do it a lot when I was a student.
I was one of the board masters.
I am one too.
Give me your username and I will add you.
But I haven't played for years.
I don't think my account is still there.
BBS had a reform a few years back.
If you've used it before... you should have access!
Oh really.
So why did you stop?
I had a bad experience with it.
So I stopped.
That sounds like a gossip.
You've never been booed?
You were one of the Villagers.
See, I didn't lie.
Alright, I got to check 0n other rooms.
See you.
Bye bye, Dr. Lin.
What a wimp!
D0 you still want this job?
Just copy and paste some news from BBS.
Why is it so hard?
Just copy and paste.
Boss, I really tried.
I got kicked out every time I logged in.
This forum is really...
I thought you won a lot of awards?
For nothing?
I gave you a lot of time.
We as reporters need to be fast, critical, and accurate!
I will give you one more day.
If you still got nothing, you are fired.
We can't afford such excellent reporters like you.
What is happening 0n the Gossip Board?
It's my first time on BBS.
I am not sure either.
Why don't we go take a look?
Thank you for your help.
N0 worries, since it's your first time too.
It's Judgment Day!
Everyone!
Get a seat.
Get yourself some sausages and get ready for the show.
Someone named Queen is going to have breaking news on the forum.
Wait and see.
Awesome!
Someone finally has the gut to go against the forum admins.
Whoever holds justice these clays made me kind of falling... in love with him.
Here comes the Queen.
My Dear Villagers, are you satisfied with my post earlier?
Board masters, forum admins, basically a bunch of vulgar people controlling BBS.
And today, I am going to reveal their ugliest secrets.
They are selfish.
Doing whatever they want in this world.
They only manage the boards based on how they feel.
They can randomly kill your posts.
Can you believe that?
All the board masters are connected.
They use all kinds of boards to control your behaviors.
If your behaviors or posts displease them, they will come together to punish you!
You have any proofs?
Good question, newbie!
Exactly, show us pictures or we call you bluffing.
Proofs?
Ha...
After watching this video... can you guys still remain so calm?
You bunch of dumb Villagers!
I am going to deny you accesses and delete all your posts.
D0 you guys know who I am?
I am the mysterious third board master of the Beauty Board.
Ha...
Hey everyone and Moderator.
This is the Dream Board master.
She said she is going to create the legendary...
Purple-Hype.
Wait,
Li Cheng-Xiang?
Come.
We will come together.
Fight those evil Villagers!
Delete all bad accounts!
Hail to the Board Masters!
Hail to the Forum Admins!
Villagers go eat shit!
Villagers go eat shit!
Dad, it caught on fire!
Thanks King for providing this wonderful video.
Great job King, thanks for bringing the justice.
And showing us the truth.
This is awesome!
Truth.
Jusfice.
They are all in people's heart.
Villagers,
Can you just let these board masters do whatever they want?
Can you all bear the feelings of being criticized and humiliated?
ID Queen,
You already violated the rules for spreading rumors and caused severely damage to the site's integrity.
I will punish you for what you just did.
Ha...
This forum is so efficient.
They actually bring out the Woodman to punish me.
Woodman?
What is that?
Woodman is a language filtering program created by the evil forum admins to get rid of gossipers like us.
He will automatically delete negative posts or notorious accounts.
This saves a lot troubles managing the site.
What the hell!
?
They think we are idiots?
Come face it, Forum Admin!
Come out and face it...
Programs are different from humans.
They don't have any taboos.
Game over?
N0 he escaped.
I thought you like to host justice?
Enjoy being chased by the forum admins, King!
What?
Dear reporter, go ahead and report this.
What are these?
Reporter?
Another one to dig news?
They don't have anywhere else to go?
Fuck you reporter!
This is for BBS only.
why are you reporting?
Surround her.
Don't let her leave!
What the hell are you guys doing?
Why bullying her?
Please hurry and leave.
Can't believe the forum admin is whooping for the reporters.
What are you guys turning BBS into?
It has been the nation's freest Internet forum.
So hungry, where should we eat?
Let's go to the night market.
ReaHy?
Fried chicken breast, buy one get one free.
I want one with cheese.
Hui, are you busy later?
Hmm...
I...
Let me tell you something.
They opened a very good fried chicken breast stand at the night market.
And those steam buns, very juicy.
Wanna join us?
Let's go.
I...
I still have something to do later.
It's so hard to ask you out.
Did you... get a boyfriend?
Nope, I just have some things to take care.
Alright, we are going then.
Call us later.
BYE bye.
I told you those board maters have problems.
There must be some inside stories.
It's not that simple.
You idiot!
I will show you.
Jerk, you got no eyes?
Sorry.
So stupid.
Hurry, she touched the handle.
You just shocked the entire Gossip Board.
Come on, I am the famous Acid Villager.
Acid Villager...
What is that?
You don't know?
Explain please...
It's easy.
It's those who talk bitter.
Just a bit bitter...
But also a little bit modest.
Just a little bit?
Can I be one too?
You?
Forget it.
You can't even talk right.
If you post something wrong, you either get deleted or denied access.
We are not in the same level, idiot.
You don't have high IQs either.
Hurry up, did you back up that video?
I already did.
Let me tell you.
Whenever someone have breaking news,
I am the first to back it up.
Back-Up Prince, hurry up then.
Oh my god, the Beauty Board master JusticeGirl is so ugly.
So ugly-
I told you it was her.
She is the one that denied us access for two weeks.
She is the one.
So annoying.
Looks like a student.
We should find her and humiliate her.
You dare to mess with us, don't be a chicken.
Such cowards!
What the hell!
Hold on...
Don't you guys think they look alike?
Look like you?
Like your mom!
N0... not me.
Like her... her...
This is getting interesting.
The actual person.
(Your account is no longer available)
What is it that you want?
It's already a mess here.
Are you really a program?
This is so cool.
Please answer my question.
I am writing an article about human search engine and Internet bullying.
BBS has what I want.
Please do not come here looking for news.
BBS has its own rules.
Your involvements will only make things worse.
This is an Internet era.
But the government hasn't taken the online world seriously.
BBS rules are obviously not cautious enough.
Otherwise today's incident won't even happen.
Online is online.
Reality is reality.
BBS is an anonymous culture.
The two shouldn't be treated with the same regulations.
People in the online world are wearing masks.
Even if they mess around, nobody can tell.
They could be extremely irresponsible behind their hidden names.
Can you guarantee that those anonymous comments won't be dangerous?
If this incident got bigger,
I will make the whole nation face it.
Although I am writing this article for other reasons.
Wait, someone is here.
Here we are again, Woodman.
Give me Queen's earrings.
I am very interested in that.
Queen's earrings?
It can help him identify her IP address.
To King, he can do whatever he wants with the IP.
She is trying to set me up.
I want to find out her real intentions.
I can find out where she logged into BBS with the IP.
Maybe even who she is.
Then I see no reasons to give it to you.
I never expect you will hand it over easily.
And this reporter here is getting very annoying.
Spreading rumors online is not something to be proud of.
You wanna go on the headline news and take blames from the society?
You got any evidence?
You!
Don't think that news media can punish people in the name ofjustice.
Online justice is not something you can define in the real world.
I am here to take down those who think they are virtuous.
Forum admins, reporters, whoever go against the villagers' crowd, will be my enemy.
We don't have time to listen to your bullshit.
You enjoy being slave of the admin?
Why don't you join me in bringing admin's ugliness to light?
That is justice to me.
You justice is not my justice.
You don't have a choice.
Go to hell!
Watch out!
You know?
As long as my enemy is a program,
I can find its weakness.
Let go of me!
You ever thought of this?
You bastard!
We humans are still smarter...
Mr. Woodman.
Ha...
Are you 0k?
So what now?
You finally called me.
Yen Cheng-Yu,
I am the Dream Board master...
Li Cheng-Xiang.
D0 you have to talk to me like a stranger?
I am talking to you right now as the BBS admin.
We aren't together anymore.
So you are one of their slaves too.
Talk!
Why do you have to do this?
This video... only me and the moderator...
What?
You hacked into his computer right?
Why do you always have to be the hero?
Stop preaching me.
Are you any better?
Who cares about the Dream Board?
You really think that board can create "Purple-Hype"?
You've changed.
I've changed?
You said I disappointed you, always addicted to the Internet, always so self-righteous,
I am always the same.
I didn't even change a bit.
Can you gFOW UP?
Why are you so obsessed with the Internet?
You have nothing to do with others' lives.
Why do you want to get involved?
Yeah...
I am very immature.
Thanks for the reminder.
But at least I am better than those like you who only talk shit behind people's back!
You aren't the one involved.
How can you judge its right 0r wrong?
We have our pressures and I'm sure you are very aware.
The gatherings are only for venting out emotions.
Why do you have to help the Queen?
Stop pretending!
You are the Queen, right?
She does whatever it takes to get her way, just like you.
"Purple-Hype"?
Stop being so stupid.
It's not even possible!
If you want to create chaos inside BBS, why drag me in too?
I guess you don't even care about how others feel.
Like the time when you broke up with me, did you even tell me why?
Did you even care how I feel?
You don't know that it hurts?
You don't deserve to tell others what to do.
Selfish bastard!
Yeah...
I am selfish.
You want to know the real reason?
Sure, I will tell you now.
It's because... you are always so full of yourself.
You never listen.
And you are still out ofjobs.
Where the hell is your future?
None of your business!
I will kick your ass first and crashed the forum before I look for a job!
Yen Cheng-Yu!
You just wait...
Li Cheng-Xiang!
Fuck!
D0 you know anyone in the video?
I tried searching their accounts online and came up empty.
I think the administrators are very cautious.
These usernames only exist in BBS.
It's hard to find them with just the video.
To search them online, we have to use accounts 0r names.
But no one knows their real names.
I can't wait to kick their asses.
We have to show them the power of the Villagers.
What the hell!
It's better if you guys stop now before it gets too late.
After all, we are just talking about the virtual world.
Shut up newbie!
You don't know any BBS rules!
Whoever messes with us need some punishment!
Look!
That new post is getting so much attention.
King!
Our God of Justice.
Li Cheng-Xiang!
You are so dead...
They will soon all quit.
I'll back it up!
Hurry up, Prince Back-Up!
Back up, Mr. Back-Up.
Something is weird...
What is?
Although this is a no-name post, the signature belongs to King, which might be used to avoid the message being deleted.
Yeah, should be.
Hmm...
It's time for us to find this bitch out.
Li Cheng-Xiang.
Guilty!
Dear Villagers!
Let's start searching for this Xiang bitch!
Her home phone, cell phone, address, education, message boards, albums, blogs, Facebook, Plurk, and MSN, as well as her friends and classmates,
I want to know every bit of her.
Don't even miss a single one!
I found Plurk and Facebook!
Album, blog, and message board, get!
Are you still open?
Shut up!
Address, education, and social group, done collecting!
Hello!
You there?
Whatever, we will do it ourselves.
Weird.
Why isn't anyone finding the most important cell phone number?
What the hell!
I found it.
Her cell and home numbers are in the year book.
Wow!
I thought you are useless.
Great job!
But why do you have Li Cheng-Xiang in your yearbook?
I went to same high school with her.
Same high school?
Why do you carry yearbooks around?
You psycho...
Dumbass!
Whatever!
What a small world!
Now we got the most important number.
Villagers, you all know what to do now?
Hello?
Is this Li Cheng-Xiang?
This is she.
Who is this?
Fuck you bitch.
You think the Villagers are idiots?
You motherfucker!
You dirty whore!
You wanna see "Purple_I_lype"?
Go to hell and you will see it.
Fuck!
Hello?
Hello?
Who is this?
She answered!
You bitch!
Stop being so arrogant.
Dream Board master is no big deal.
Quit your ass!
Who the hell are you guys?
Why bothered to call?
Fuck you bitch!
You try to act innocent now?
You think BBS Villagers are dumbasses?
Aren't you the one who told us to eat shit with Beauty Board master?
Go eat shit yourself!
Fuck!
One more left.
She is nearby too.
Why did you bring the reporter here?
King took Queen's earrings.
Sorry, am I a trouble here?
N0, please stay.
Wow!
What a glamorous place.
How did you even get in?
You think that punch from me was only to get you injured?
I stole your access to Moderator's Room as well.
anyway/ this place is absolutely gorgeous.
Yen Cheng-Yu!
You have any idea what you have done?
Mr. Moderator actually knows my real name.
I guess I am popular!
I think I see another familiar face,
Beauty Board master Hui.
You earned yourself a name!
I can't believe that Xiang used to love a bastard like you.
That is quite pathetic.
Ha!
It's not up to you bunch of hypocrites to decide ifl am a bastard.
Those Villagers are very supportive of me!
Why do you have to do this?
Xiang did so much for you and you still don't get it?
I don't?
Yeah, maybe.
She tried to set me up with Queen's account.
You call that "so much"?
Yen Cheng-Yu!
Don't trash talk with no proofs!
I shall tell Moderator to delete your account.
Wow!
Can you not abuse your power?
The Xiang I know is not this kind of person.
D0 you know about her cancer?
Cancer?
She kept it from you so you won't have to worry.
She thinks her existence is going to ruin your life, so she chose to leave you.
She hopes that you won't have to miss her for the rest of your life.
You get it?
You think you know Xiang?
She has been in Central Hospital this whole time!
Stop lying to me.
How can she...
You shouldn't have posted her real name on BBS.
All those Villagers are bashing her online right now and even human-flesh-searching her.
Wait...
Her real name?
I have no idea at all.
Didn't you post this?
That bastard stole my signature.
And...
N0 matter how much I hate her,
I won't do such a disgusting thing.
Who the hell is it then?
Woodman, where is Queen's earring?
I have it.
Oh no... you kidding me?
Ladies and gentlemen!
Welcome to the National Hacker Competition.
The contestants are ready.
Here we...
GO!
We have a winner.
It's King!
Amazingly fast...
Incredible!
You guys are such amateurs.
How did you do that?
King!
King!
King!
We were in a match before.
My name is Huang Kuan-Chun,
ID Mimic.
D0 you still remember me?
So...
Xiang is not Queen.
And this letter
Xiang just sent me.
Dear Hui, sorry that I caused so much trouble.
Please apologize to Moderator for me.
I indeed don't fit to be a board master.
I can't even take care such small things.
It's time to say goodbye, whether BBS or the real world.
I am really tired.
Thank you all for taking care of me.
Goodbye.
P.S
I'm still not able to tell him about my cancer.
So please let it remain a secret.
She won't pick up her phone.
This is getting serious.
We might have to close down the forum.
Sorry reporter, would you please stay quiet about this?
Hospital?
Quite close.
Wait, where are you going?
I am going too!
Cheng-Yu, wait.
You can't.
You have more urgent things to do.
I misunderstood Xiang.
I need to go apologize to her.
You need to find you this Queen bastard and bust his ass.
BBS now needs you to figure out what's going on.
If the reporter really write about this and if this incident resulted in people dying, we will not only lose Xiang, but the entire group.
We will take care of Xiang.
Take this with you.
It's the remaining part of the video.
Let's go look for Xiang, Moderator.
Here is a task for you, Woodman.
Please announce in the lobby area that BBS will be closed for maintenance.
It's urgent.
Hui and I are heading out.
Got it.
(BBS Control Center)
May I... ask a favor from you?
What do you guys want?
Nothing...
Just want to tell everyone that the legendary and most beautiful Beauty Board master is in our school!
Done laughing?
I can't believe you are this kind of person.
I shouldn't have voted for you.
As a matter of fact, you really don't deserve to be our board master!
You think you're cool?
Tired of us?
You just hate us don't you?
So annoying.
You think being a board master means anything?
Nice work, huh?
Deleting all our posts?
Look at you...
Comparing to the other two beautiful board masters, you are shit and they are angels!
You want to get a boyfriend?
Why don't you look at the mirror first?
Step down, you ugly!
Get out of the Beauty Board!
Go home and look in the mirror!
If I ever look like you, I would commit suicide!
Exactly!
Get out!
Out!
Out...
Enough!
Is it that fun to judge how others look?
Whenever you tease about the photos of those girls in front of the computers, have you ever thought how they would feel?
Yeah.
I know I am a jerk.
I never should have said something like that.
What about those of you who sit in front the computers and talk shit all day anonymously?
Are you guys any better?
Stop lecturing us!
BBS is always anonymous.
Tell you what...
You should be our role model as the board master.
See the other two masters?
They did a great job!
Unlike you, bitch!
Why don't you tell me how they are better?
At least they get along with the users, unlike you.
Yeah!
They are pretty too!
D0 you guys have any idea... how much I have to give up... to be a responsible board master?
Could you imagine taking care of the boards for 16 hours a day?
I sacrificed my time with friends and also my study time.
I gave up all the things I like to do so that
I have time to maintain orders 0n the Beauty Board.
That way, those two... beautiful board masters, who don't do shit, won't get any of your ridicules!
I am not a robot.
I do have my emotions.
Since you guys dislike me,
That's fine!
I will do what you wish for.
I quit!
See that?
I am out!
Wow!
First floor!
So high!
Can everyone hear me ifl speak here?
My first time!
Mom, I am on TV!
How did you sneak in?
Ha...
Villagers are everywhere in this world.
Mr. Wood, be happier!
Don't touch me!
Who opened the gate when Moderator is gone?
Who intentionally hurt those by-standing Villagers?
You bunch of evil villains!
I can't believe King betrayed us!
He allied with the forum admins.
Is he here to announce something?
Who got BBS in chaos in the first place?
In here, we are the majority that says it all and no one else.
This is...
Justice of the Crowd!
You are useless now.
Ridiculous...
If... this is what you called "Justice", then I shall turn into Hellfire, and burn down this place!
Please take this.
It can empower you.
I don't need that.
You have no idea how evil humans can be.
Online comments are not something a program can handle.
I will take care of things properly.
I owed all of you too much.
I hope you can help me on this.
Give me a few minutes before the system shut down.
This chip can let me explain everything to the Villagers through you.
You really think I have to help you?
I know you can somehow think.
Use yourjudgment.
Please remember one thing, the real justice needs great power!
Here we go...
Round Two!
If one day, we are very far away from each other, will you come when I need you?
Of course!
(Voice Input)
(Initiated)
(Online Webcam)
(Off)
Welcome!
I have been expecting you.
Mimic...
Ha...
You finally remember me?
You like my present?
I never thought Xiang's online account could create such a big chaos on BBS.
That's just unbelievable.
You son of a bitch!
When did you plant the Trojan horse in Xiang's laptop?
Hold on...
Don't rush.
Watch the traps!
Asshole!
I am just lucky to bump into your ex-girlfriend.
A perfect chance that God gave me.
I have been waiting for it for a long time.
I knew I lost last time.
I won't lose again.
Not to a jobless person!
You created this chaos to retaliate against me just because of that boring competition?
You are ridiculous!
A boring competition?
Fuck.
You don't know that competition affected my life so much, that all my friends take me as a joke.
We the losers have to spend so much time to finally stand up again and find a decent job.
You haughty motherfucker should have already been punished!
I am here to cuff you with God's order.
Great.
Are you cursing me now?
Last time was killing a bug,
I guess it's killing God now!
Go to hell!
Excuse me.
Yes!
I am a bitch!
I am a whore!
Is that enough?
Sorry sir, my car broke down.
It won't turn on.
Tow is on the way.
Sorry, sorry about that.
Thank you.
Keep the change.
Moderator!
Get on!
Don't back down!
We outnumber them.
You know nothing about the human world.
Everyone can be a judge here.
When evidences are presented in front of us, the Villagers' Justice is the Absolute Justice!
What the hell?
D0 you know what will happen if you mess with all of us?
Like I care!
What a trouble!
Is that the... last defense of BBS we heard about?
The System Wizard!
My name is System Wizard, the last line of defense for BBS.
Woodman!
You...
Cut to the chase, I only have ten seconds.
Let's get it over with!
Get out of my way!
Evil can't beat the good?
Wow!
The System Wizard is still the most resilient program we got.
We won!
We won!
Look!
Woodman is still alive!
We need to stop it now!
Take this photo with you.
Why don't you show me the justice you speak so much about, Woodman?
Time out!
System Announcement.
All accesses are currently suspended.
Dad, it's broken.
What?
Hold 0n.
In the online world, our kindness can be so pure.
Yet, our evilness can also be extremely brutal.
There is no right 0r wrong between the board masters and the Villagers.
Whoever caused the problem should be responsible.
That would be justice to me.
King!
It's all on you now.
That's all you got?
Home court advantage, nothing to be proud of.
Looks like I am the winner.
A few years ago, you lost to me on this.
And you still suck so much.
I won't make the same mistake.
That last step is to bury you, along with your childish BBS culture.
You bunch of idiots,
I merely spread some rumors with Trojan horse.
I never expect such a sensational turnout.
If anybody got hurt because of BBS,
I don't think the government will let such dangerous forum to exist.
You will always be remembered as the traitor of BBS.
I've been waiting to hear that from you.
It's about time!
What's going on?
Back then at the Hacker Competition, you tried so hard to hack my computer.
All I did was...
Make the winning indicator light up.
Surely, you are better than me now.
But I have things that I want to protect,
BBS and Xiang.
I apologize for what I did before.
Now you have to pay the price for what you did!
So, smile!
Are you crazy, King?
Smile?
BBS Villagers are bunch of idiots.
Even when things got to this point, they still firmly believe that you and the forum admin cheated them.
I told you!
This bastard totally fooled us.
You are done.
It's time for BBS to shut down!
And you will be the scapegoat.
You think I'm the only one who saw your nasty face?
Who else?
Ha...
The whole BBS Villagers just saw it.
Smile!
Wholly Shit!
My dear Villagers,
I really love you guys.
I really love you guys.
BBS Villagers are the sweetest.
Last time...
Thank you guys so much... for celebrating my birthday.
I even spent my birthday on BBS.
Thank you, Villagers.
Sometimes emotions pile up when managing the boards.
But we are all very happy.
Thank you.
I want to tell all of you.
Although there are so many forums online,
I only use BBS!
We all feel the same.
G0 BBS!
I can't hold it anymore.
(BBS SYSTEM will shut down...)
Will it reboot again?
We can't lose Xiang.
We need to save her.
Damn.
Please restart resta rt.
We can't live without BBS.
Why is it not 0n yet?
Hurry...
Everyone go to the Dream Board.
Let's bring Xiang back.
To bring her back.
(Online Count)
Oh shit.
What should we do now?
We are too over this time.
She is about to jump off.
N0 one ever expect this.
Let's figure a way out to save her.
Who took the photo?
Reporter.
Why doesn't she save her if she is there?
What will you do when a stranger come up to you when you want to die?
I would just jump off.
Where are all the people I know?
The GPS position is on that photo.
Anyone know where that is?
Central Hospital.
Should we start a fan group for Xiang?
Ok!
If she saw so many people supporting her, she will change her mind.
Ag reed.
Let me create a fan group then.
What the hell are you guys doing?
If we only typed on the keyboards, we can't stop the tragedy from happening.
But I am still at work.
I think everyone else too?
Yeah.
BBS is like a family to rne.
Every Villager is a member of it.
Although we argue every clay, there are still a lot of interesting things going on.
Now we have a Villager standing on the rooftop waiting for us to save her.
Can you still sit so calmly in front of the computer?
She is one of our family!
Xiang!
You idiot!
What are you trying to do?
Moderator
Hui
Stay back!
Sorry...
I am really tired.
I can't be cured anyway.
Xiang...
Don't listen to those Villagers.
Let's solve this together.
Please don't do this!
Solved?
It can never be solved.
I am just really really tired.
Why am I still alive?
Listen to me.
This incident has nothing to do with you.
It's all a misunderstanding!
Those Villagers are right...
I wasted a lot of medical resources.
I am a bitch.
I will lose all my hair.
I Will die!
Xiang, don't be like this.
Cheng-Yu already explained everything for you.
Tell him he doesn't have to do anything for me.
He and I are over.
I am a selfish bitch.
I deserved all this.
Xiang, please don't think this way.
Cheng-Yu doesn't mean it.
It's just so stupid... to think for others...
Xiang!
Ignore BBS and all those Villagers.
Think about those who care about you.
Aren't there things you still love in this world?
You still have a lot left to do!
You didn't even tell Cheng-Yu about your cancer.
I don't think there will ever be a chance.
Xiang!
Come back here!
I already shut down BBS.
There is always a solution.
It's 0k.
Now...
Ijust have to jump off from here.
I want them to always remember... they murdered a girl with BBS!
Xiang
D0 you believe in miracles?
Miracle...
It's happening!
Oh my god!
This is...
Justice of the Crowd!
(Hype)
You see that?
It's "Purple-Hype"!
We will clear your name.
Li Cheng-Xiang!
Don't give up!
It's not over yet!
What are you doing?
This is an ASCII icon in BBS.
That is my posting signature.
So cool right?
Can you draw me one?
I'm busy.
5o stingY-
Thank you everyone!
I am fine now.
It's 0k.
She's ok.
Xiang is fine now!
(Intruder Reported)
We are the telecommunication polices.
Evidence indicated that you are hacking corporate computers.
We are here to arrest you.
Not yet.
I haven't saved Xiang.
Don't stop me!
Let's go.
Don't stop me!
You still want to run after all this?
Don't do anything stupid.
The police station is nearby.
P0Hce?
Don't run...
That is all I know.
Ok.
I have to keep these information.
Go ahead.
I am not going to write this article.
I started to feel that
I am one 0f the Villagers now.
Ms. Blue, this picture is for you.
You can leave now.
Yen Cheng-Yu, you are good to go.
Who... bailed me out?
Hmm...
The Villagers!
Hui, you want to eat lunch together?
N0 again?
Well, it's not that.
Can my friends join?
Of course!
Let's go, everyone!
Time to eat!
Eat...
Dr. Lin,
YOU wanna... try your account password?
I haven't used it for such a long time.
I don't think it will work.
Just try it.
I met a girl when
I was in college.
We met on BBS.
Back then, we were still using dial-up to go online.
We fell madly in love.
But after graduation, she moved abroad and we lost contact ever since.
I waited for her for quite a while on BBS.
Now I think back about it, it's kind of funny.
All the passwords I tried didn't work, forget it.
Don't give up!
You won't know the outcome unless you fight till the last moment.
It works now!
And I have an unread message.
I wonder who sent it.
Is it from her?
Yeah...
Isn't it great?
BBS...
King!
King!
Don't take pictures of me...
Just one.
N0...
Who called?
(The doctor said my cancer cells have spread)
(I gave myself a reason to live on everyday)
(I really miss the times we spend together)
(But you are so far away from me now)
He's an Observer.
They only show up at significant events.
That he's here must mean it's important.
Previously on Fringe... (Walter) He wants to go into the Observer's mind.
I do not have long.
I need you to do something for me.
Walter.
How can she have memories of my Olivia's life that are clearer to her than her own?
No matter how badly I want my Olivia back,
I can't make this one have memories she didn't experience.
(Walter) I think you are.
Even without meaning to.
And it's wrong, Peter.
I don't understand what's happening to me, but if you look into my eyes, you can see that I am her.
No.
I know she's out there-- my Olivia in my timeline.
I'm sorry.
I think it's better if I just stay away.
[Dialogue inaudible]
The whole world is on fire, starting with my office.
We've had to completely reevaluate all our security measures after what that woman did.
The truth is...
I wanted to give you time to collect your thoughts.
I know when there's something you want to talk about.
I'm in love with Peter.
I know it sounds absurd to you.
I hardly know him.
But it's like I've known him my entire life.
And everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.
When Walter told me what you were going through-- two sets of memories, two sets of experiences-- he said the Cortexiphan dosing might be enabling you to remember things that Peter wants you to remember.
But I can remember things that Peter couldn't have known, like details of cases that he wasn't on or names, um, places he's never been.
I mean, how can that be if--if he's controlling it?
I don't know how this is happening, but...
I'm scared.
We're gonna figure out what's happening with you, Olive.
Now, as for your feelings about Peter, all wounds heal over time.
Yeah.
I just wish the time would move a little quicker.
Well, that's a coincidence, because we just filed a patent on that last week.
It's good to be with you.
We should do this more often.
What's wrong?
We always have breakfast together on Saturday mornings.
We were here last week.
Are you saying you don't remember?
I'm worried.
You're having these experiences at what cost?
I'll talk to Walter.

(Walter) Olivia.
- Hello, Walter.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Is everything all right?
- I've run out of MMs.
But I want to show you something.
I ordered this on the interweb to keep an eye on our cleaning crew.
- A teddy bear?
- A teddy bear-witness.
It has a camera.
To my surprise, this inadvertently recorded the event between Peter and our bald man in the lab.
Come.
[Keys clack] What do you see?
I see him disappear and then the table get knocked over.
Uh-huh.
Look again.
Do you see the blip?
Okay, I saw it then.
I believe something happened here that was undetectable to the human eye.
Ah!
They're back from M.I.T.
What did I just pick up, Walter?
There were a lot of security precautions.
It's an apparatus designed to slow down video.
The playback rate is so deccelerated that you can actually see light particles.
Come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I was gonna come and talk to Walter, but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.
Astro, my waffle iron blew its fuse.
[Cell phone rings]
Uh, this is Dunham.
(Broyles) Jane Hall-- she was found by her sister.
That's severe bruising.
Those aren't bruises.
The victim's skin had a reaction to some type of chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.
So why are we here?
This is the second killing in a month where a woman has had the same marks.
Both were recently widowed.
And the husbands died under mysterious circumstances.
(Broyles) The bodies were dumped in fields, completely dehydrated.
As a matter of fact, Ms. Hall had just arrived home from her husband Mark's funeral when she was killed.
Okay, so we know that the killer is targeting couples.
There's one more thing.
In both cases, DNA of the deceased husbands was found on the victims' necks.
You're saying that both widows were killed by their dead mates?
It appears that's what the evidence is saying.
But her husband's body was only exhumed 15 minutes ago.
Oh, my.
[Cell phone vibrates] Hello?
Peter, I need you here immediately--where are you?
I'm in a cab on my way to the bus station.
Bus station?
Where are you going?
(Peter) New York.
You wanted me to stay away from her, remember?
And a bus is as good a mode of transportation as any when you're trying to get out of town.
You didn't tell me.
Anyway, you must come back to the lab at once.
Why, what's going on?
I think the Observer may have done something to your eye.
(Peter) Whatever he did, it wasn't seen by the other Observers.
All I care about is what he's done to you.
So what's in New York?
I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York--
Olivia.
I admire you, Peter.
[Grunts]
[Chuckles] And why is that, Walter?
I told you what the right thing, ethically, was to do... leaving Olivia...
But I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it myself.
Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?
It's a... particularly obtuse way to admit that you're a better man than I am.
Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy.
Is that Greek?
Yeah.
Yeah, it means be a better man than your father.
It's something I was told a long time ago.
But it is very strange to hear you say it.
Hmm.
What is it?
There's something in there.
It's got writing on it.
(Peter) It's an address.
(Walter) 228 1/2 Morrow Street.
It's amazing.
I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course, would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.
You think this would have etched itself into my brain?
(Walter) Organic ocular suggestion.
You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.
(Man) Dr. Bishop?
What?
Agent Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- Jane Hall.
I think it's a case, Walter.
Oh.
Oh, oh, right.
Well, fine.
Bring the poor dear down and put her on the slab.
[Ominous music]
(Walter) The human body is composed of 60% water.
However, Mr. Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.
He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.
Among other things that are lost with such...
[Grunts] dehydration... are pheromones.
It wasn't only Mr. hall's DNA found on his widow's neck.
Specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's pheromones, which is what's causing the burning on the victim's neck.
Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?
They control our moods, our appetites...
Who we give our hearts to.
So he's targeting couples, killing the male, extracting the pheromones.
Do you think that he's trying to win the female?
A love potion?
Possibly.
[Crunching]
Mm...
I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.
Okay.
I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations, see if I can get their files pulled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.
I made him get off the bus to New York.
But you didn't know that.
That he was on his way to New York?
No.
Where is he now?
[Doorknob creaks]
Thank you, dear.
Walter, my memories are slipping.
They're disappearing.
Your own memories?
You said to me they're in the back of your mind.
Well, I didn't tell anybody that it was happening, because if Peter was gonna be with me, then I didn't think about the consequences.
I just didn't care.
But it's getting worse, Walter, whatever it is that's happening.
And I want you to try and stop it.
I want you to see if you can reverse it.
I just--I want to go back to who I was.
Olivia...
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I'll think of something.
(Man) I can do that, if you want.
Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Oh, he's so cute.
I don't know about cute.
This is Omar.
Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you two look so in love.
Beautiful.
- Oh, it's great.
- Perfect.
You guys from around here?
Yeah, Brooklyn.
(Woman) Come on, Oliver.
[Woman chuckles]
All right.
[Woman chuckles]

(Man) Thank you.
Thanks.
(Woman) Andrew, be sure to get the lake in the background.
I could take that picture for you, if you want.
Smell this.
[Inhales deeply]
[Coughs]
Walter, what is that?
It is putrid!
Mortius bestia-- roadkill.
Specifically, an aromatic excretion from the castor sacs of the North American beaver used primarily for marking and mating.
I went beaver hunting in eastern Canada in the '70s.
Of course, in those days,
"beaver" meant something else entirely.
Walter, why would you make me wear this and smell roadkill?
Because I have been smelling things for the past hour, and I've lost my objectivity.
Now are you gonna help me or not?
Okay, take a look at these.
These are statements from friends and family.
The one thing that they said about both couples is that they had great, solid, loving marriages.
So?
So maybe he's targing couples that personify the kind of love that he wants.
What?
Nothing.
[Clears throat]
Are you okay?
I mean, with all you've been through in the past few days...
You know, if you ever... need anything...
I'm here.
I know.
[Knocks on door]
Um, Walter wants to know which of you has fearless nasal passages.
For thousands of years, perfume makers have used a single disparate, rancid note to counterbalance all of the other sweet and unctuous scents in a fragrance.
The ancient Mesopotamians used fish oil.
The Greeks used animal carcass.
The Egyptians used afterbirth.
But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.
You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?
No.
But like perfume, the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex...
Does contain a rancid note.
I found this on Jane Hall's neck, mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.
It's an ingredient called castoreum.
- Hmm?
(Astrid) Uh-uh.
Anyway, we can trace it.
It is not easy to get.
I only found five perfume manufacturers that use it.
You guys can work these, and I'll take these.
[Inhales sharply]

[Beeping continues]
[Cell phone rings]
- Hey, Astrid.

Where are you?
We're just leaving Scentax.

I told him to get a ride home from work because...
[Voice breaking] Because I was too busy.
Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.
We're in position.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
You must have loved each other very much.
We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown.
This August, it... would have been 15 years.
We were best friends in college.
He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another.
He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen...
What I was looking for.
He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them.
It's different, you know.
But people get tired... of looking and hoping.
Maybe he's taking his time.
Like he did with Jane Hall.
Or maybe he was never coming here at all.
This guy targets couples in love.
You heard her talking about her marriage.
Why would Carr pick them?
Mrs. Sutter, is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?
How did you know?
Do you know her name?

Do you know how much pain you caused?
I don't want you to think that I did it for me.
I mean, not just for me.
We're not meant to be alone.
It's every human being's right to know love.
And had I succeeded...
Had I found the right chemicals-- just the right... balance...
I could have given the world... what you have.
What do I have?
Love.
I can smell that you're in love.
(Nina) I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I was just making some tea.
How are you feeling?
I'm okay.
I talked to Walter.
What did he say?
It doesn't matter.
I met a woman today.
She'd just lost her husband, and as she was talking about him and her marriage, as much as she wanted to be, she--she wasn't in love.
As I was listening to her...
I realized what she was saying.
She had let go of the possibility of love... of finding love.
And I could see myself in her.
I didn't like who I was.
Now, all of these... memories and feelings that I'm experiencing, they're from a--a better version of me.
I've decided to let things run their course.
Oh, you had an emotional day, and you don't have to decide anything right now.
I've made my decision.
You have so much in your life, Olive.
Are you just gonna let that all disappear?
And be replaced by what?
Memories...of a life that you didn't live?
Yes.
Well, how long do we have?
I don't know.
Neither does Walter.
Hmm.
Well, my mother used to say,
"Encourage the quest for happiness in your children, even if it takes them very far away from you."
When the day comes... if I don't remember this...
I want you to try and build something with me again.
Don't give up on me.
I love you, Nina.
I love you, Olive.
Thank you.
For what?
They hid the universe from me.
They locked me out.
- You mean the other Observers.
- Yes.
What I led you to is a beacon.
I needed you to activate it so I could find my way back.
So I helped you.
Then I need you to help me now.
I have tried everything that I can think of... everything that I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked.
And nobody here can help me.
But you can.
I know you can.
Please... help me get back home.
You have been home all along.
I don't understand.
I was erased.
There is no scientific explanation.
But...
I have a theory based on a uniquely human principle.
I believe you could not be fully erased because the people who care about you would not let you go.
And you... would not let them go.
I believe you call it "love."
And Olivia?
She is your Olivia.

Walter.
How can she have memories of my Olivia's life that are clearer to her than her own?
No matter how badly I want my Olivia back,
I can't make this one have memories she didn't experience.
(Walter) I think you are.
Even without meaning to.
And it's wrong, Peter.
I don't understand what's happening to me, but if you look into my eyes, you can see that I am her.
No.
I know she's out there-- my Olivia in my timeline.
I'm sorry.
I think it's better if I just stay away.
[Dialogue inaudible]
The whole world is on fire, starting with my office.
We've had to completely reevaluate all our security measures after what that woman did.
The truth is...
I wanted to give you time to collect your thoughts.
I know when there's something you want to talk about.
I'm in love with Peter.
I know it sounds absurd to you.
I hardly know him.
But it's like I've known him my entire life.
And everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.
When Walter told me what you were going through-- two sets of memories, two sets of experiences-- he said the Cortexiphan dosing might be enabling you to remember things that Peter wants you to remember.
But I can remember things that Peter couldn't have known, like details of cases that he wasn't on or names, um, places he's never been.
I mean, how can that be if--if he's controlling it?
I don't know how this is happening, but...
I'm scared.
We're gonna figure out what's happening with you, Olive.
Now, as for your feelings about Peter, all wounds heal over time.
Yeah.
I just wish the time would move a little quicker.
Well, that's a coincidence, because we just filed a patent on that last week.
It's good to be with you.
We should do this more often.

- Hello, Walter.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Is everything all right?
- I've run out of MMs.
But I want to show you something.
I ordered this on the interweb to keep an eye on our cleaning crew.
- A teddy bear?
- A teddy bear-witness.
It has a camera.
To my surprise, this inadvertently recorded the event between Peter and our bald man in the lab.
Come.
[Keys clack] What do you see?
I see him disappear and then the table get knocked over.
Uh-huh.
Look again.
Do you see the blip?
Okay, I saw it then.
I believe something happened here that was undetectable to the human eye.
Ah!
They're back from M.I.T.
What did I just pick up, Walter?
There were a lot of security precautions.
It's an apparatus designed to slow down video.
The playback rate is so deccelerated that you can actually see light particles.
Come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I was gonna come and talk to Walter, but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.
Astro, my waffle iron blew its fuse.
[Cell phone rings]
Uh, this is Dunham.
(Broyles) Jane Hall-- she was found by her sister.
That's severe bruising.
Those aren't bruises.
The victim's skin had a reaction to some type of chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.
So why are we here?
This is the second killing in a month where a woman has had the same marks.
Both were recently widowed.
And the husbands died under mysterious circumstances.
(Broyles) The bodies were dumped in fields, completely dehydrated.
As a matter of fact, Ms. Hall had just arrived home from her husband Mark's funeral when she was killed.
Okay, so we know that the killer is targeting couples.
There's one more thing.
In both cases, DNA of the deceased husbands was found on the victims' necks.
You're saying that both widows were killed by their dead mates?
It appears that's what the evidence is saying.
But her husband's body was only exhumed 15 minutes ago.
Oh, my.
[Cell phone vibrates] Hello?
Peter, I need you here immediately--where are you?
I'm in a cab on my way to the bus station.
Bus station?
Where are you going?
(Peter) New York.
You wanted me to stay away from her, remember?
And a bus is as good a mode of transportation as any when you're trying to get out of town.
You didn't tell me.
Anyway, you must come back to the lab at once.
Why, what's going on?
I think the observer may have done something to your eye.
(Peter) Whatever he did, it wasn't seen by the other observers.
All I care about is what he's done to you.
So what's in New York?
I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York--
Olivia.
I admire you, Peter.
[Grunts]
[Chuckles] And why is that, Walter?
I told you what the right thing, ethically, was to do... leaving Olivia...
But I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it myself.
Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?
It's a... particularly obtuse way to admit that you're a better man than I am.
Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy.
Is that Greek?
Yeah.
Yeah, it means be a better man than your father.
It's something I was told a long time ago.
But it is very strange to hear you say it.
Hmm.
What is it?
There's something in there.
It's got writing on it.
(Peter) It's an address.
(Walter) 228 1/2 Morrow Street.
It's amazing.
I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course, would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.
You think this would have etched itself into my brain?
(Walter) Organic ocular suggestion.
You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.
(Man) Dr. Bishop?
What?
Agent Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- Jane Hall.
I think it's a case, Walter.
Oh.
Oh, oh, right.
Well, fine.
Bring the poor dear down and put her on the slab.
[Ominous music]
(Walter) The human body is composed of 60% water.
However, Mr. Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.
He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.
Among other things that are lost with such...
[Grunts] dehydration... are pheromones.
It wasn't only Mr. hall's DNA found on his widow's neck.
Specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's pheromones, which is what's causing the burning on the victim's neck.
Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?
They control our moods, our appetites...
Who we give our hearts to.
So he's targeting couples, killing the male, extracting the pheromones.
Do you think that he's trying to win the female?
A love potion?
Possibly.
[Crunching]
Mm...
I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.
Okay.
I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations, see if I can get their files pulled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.
I made him get off the bus to New York.
But you didn't know that.
That he was on his way to New York?
No.
Where is he now?
[Doorknob creaks]
Thank you, dear.
Walter, my memories are slipping.
They're disappearing.
Your own memories?
You said to me they're in the back of your mind.
Well, I didn't tell anybody that it was happening, because if Peter was gonna be with me, then I didn't think about the consequences.
I just didn't care.
But it's getting worse, Walter, whatever it is that's happening.
And I want you to try and stop it.
I want you to see if you can reverse it.
I just--I want to go back to who I was.

I don't want to feel like this anymore.

Well, come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I was gonna come and talk to Walter but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.
Astro, my waffle iron blew this fuse.
This is Dunham.
Jane Hall.
She was found by her sister.
- That's severe bruising.
- Those aren't bruises.
The skin had a reaction to chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.
- Why are we here?
- This is the second killing in a month where a woman's had the same marks.
Both were recently widowed.
The husbands died under mysterious circumstances.
Their bodies were dumped in fields, completely dehydrated.
Mrs. Hall had just arrived home from her husband, Mark's, funeral when she was killed.
Okay, so we know that the killer is targeting couples.
There's one more thing.
In both cases DNA of the deceased husbands was found on the victims' necks.
You're saying both widows were killed by their dead mates?
That's what the evidence is saying.
Her husband's body was only exhumed 15 minutes ago.
Oh, my.
- Hello.
- Peter.
I need you here immediately.
Where are you?
I'm in a cab on my way to the bus station.
- Bus station?
Where are you going?
- New York.
You wanted me to stay away from her, remember?
A bus is as good a mode of transportation as any when you're trying to get out of town.
You didn't tell me.
Anyway, you must come back to the lab at once.
Why?
What's going on?
I think the Observer may have done something to your eye.
Whatever he did, it wasn't seen by the other Observers.
All I care about is what he's done to you.
So, what's in New York?
I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York.
Olivia.
I admire you, Peter.
And why's that, Walter?
I told you what the right thing, ethically, was to do.
Leaving Olivia.
But I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it myself.
Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?
It's a particularly obtuse way to admit that you're a better man than I am.
Is that Greek?
Yeah.
It means, "Be a better man than your father."
Something I was told a long time ago.
But it is very strange to hear you say it.
- Hm.
- What is it?
There's something in there.
It's got writing on it.
It's an address.
2281/2 Morrow Street.
It's amazing.
I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.
You think this would've etched itself into my brain?
Organic ocular suggestion.
You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.
- Dr. Bishop?
- What?
Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- "Jane Hall."
I think it's a case, Walter.
Oh, right.
Fine.
Bring the poor dear down and put her on the slab.
The human body is composed of 60 percent water.
However, Mr. Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.
He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.
Among other things that are lost with such dehydration are pheromones.
It wasn't only Mr. Hall's DNA found on his widow's neck specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's pheromones which is what's causing the burning on the victims' necks.
Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?
They control our moods, our appetite, who we give our hearts to.
So he's targeting couples.
Killing the male, extracting the pheromones.
Do you think that he's trying to win the female?
A love potion?
Possibly.
Hm.
I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.
Okay, I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations.
See if I can get their files pulled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.
I made him get off the bus to New York.
But you didn't know that.
That he was on his way to New York?
No.
Where is he now?
Thank you, dear.
Walter, my memories are slipping.
- They're disappearing.
- Your own memories?
You said they were in the back of your mind.
I didn't tell anybody it was happening because if Peter was gonna be with me then I didn't think about the consequences.
I just didn't care.
But it's getting worse, Walter.
Whatever it is that's happening.
And I want you to try and stop it.
I want you to see if you can reverse it.
I wanna go back to who I was.
Olivia.
I don't wanna feel like this anymore.
I'll think of something.
- I can do that if you want.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
He's so cute.
Yeah, I don't know about cute.
This is Omar.
Are you ready?
Oh, you two look so in love.
Beautiful.
- That's great.
- Perfect.
You guys from around here?
- Yeah, Brookline.
- Come on, Oliver.
All right.
- Well, take care.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Andrew, be sure to get the lake in the background.
I could take that picture for you if you want.
Smell this.
Walter, what is that?
It is putrid.
Mortius bestia.
Roadkill.
Specifically, an aromatic excretion from the castor sacs of the North American beaver.
Used primarily for marking and mating.
I went beaver hunting in Eastern Canada during the '70s.
Of course, in those days, "beaver" meant something else entirely.
Walter, why would you make me wear this and smell roadkill?
Because I've been smelling things for the past hour and I've lost my objectivity.
Now, are you going to help me or not?
Okay, take a look at these.
These are statements from friends and family.
The one thing that they said about both couples is that they had great, solid, loving marriages.
- So?
- So maybe he's targeting couples that personify the kind of love that he wants.
What?
Nothing.
Ahem.
Are you okay?
I mean, with all you've been through in the past few days?
You know, if you ever need anything I'm here.
I know.
Walter wants to know which of you has fearless nasal passages.
For thousands of years, perfume makers have used a single disparate rancid note to counterbalance the other sweet and unctuous scents in a fragrance.
The ancient Mesopotamians used fish oil the Greeks used animal carcass, the Egyptians used afterbirth.
But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.
You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?
No.
But like perfume the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex, does contain a rancid note.
I found this on Jane Hall's neck mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.
- It's an ingredient called castoreum.
- Hm.
Uh-uh.
Anyway, we can trace it.
It is not easy to get, I only found five perfume manufacturers that use it.
You guys can work these and I'll take these.
- Hey, Astrid.
- Hey, where are you?
We're just leaving Scentax, on our way to KJS.
Forget about that place.
Empire World Fragrance fired one of its employees a few months ago for theft.
- Guess what he stole.
- Castoreum.
Do you have an address?
Let me out!
One on one to talk to you
Like film stars they get close to you
You've mirrored his appeal
He wants you so He wants to be beside you
Then you pass by
Giving him the other side of you
Like the mystics do
So that every time he moves He moves for you
Soul and light can always see The meeting of true love and she
This silent night and I
I guess a lonely mind might see
I've seen love on the screen
Move, move!
Watch your step.
Clear.
Upstairs, negative.
It's still warm.
He was just here.
Olivia.
He's married.
Andrew Sutter, age 36, 212 Peatmont Avenue, Milton.
I'm gonna call Broyles.
Tell him we know who the next victim's going to be.
It's okay, we're with the FBI.
My name is Dunham.
What are you doing?
Are you Dianna Sutter?
The last time I spoke to Andrew was this morning.
His car's in the shop today.
I told him to get a ride home from work, because...
Because I was too busy.
Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.
We're in position.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
You must have loved each other very much.
We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown.
This August it would have been 15 years.
We were best friends in college.
He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another.
He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen.
What I was looking for.
He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them.
It's different, you know?
But people get tired of looking and hoping.
Maybe he's taking his time, like he did with Jane Hall.
Or maybe he was never coming here at all.
This guy targets couples in love.
You heard her talking about her marriage.
Why would Carr pick them?
Is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?
How did you know?
Do you know her name?
The president returned home today from his trip overseas.
He's expected to meet with congress tomorrow to discuss, among other...
Who...?
What are you doing in my house?
- No!
- Shh.
- Get off me!
- Shh!
Shh-shh-shh.
God, please God.
No, help me!
Help me!
Shh!
Shh!
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Let her go.
Move away from her.
Do you know how much pain you caused?
I don't want you to think that I did it for me.
I mean, not just for me.
We're not meant to be alone.
It's every human being's right to know love.
And had I succeeded had I found the right chemicals, just the right balance I could have given the world what you have.
What do I have?
Love.
I can smell that you're in love.
I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I was just making some tea.
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay.
- I talked to Walter.
- What did he say?
Well, it doesn't matter.
I met a woman today.
She'd just lost her husband and as she was talking about him and her marriage as much as she wanted to be, she wasn't in love.
As I was listening to her I realized what she was saying.
She had let go of the possibility of love.
Of finding love.
And I could see myself in her.
I didn't like who I was.
All of these memories and feelings that I'm experiencing they're from a better version of me.
I've decided to let things run their course.
No, you had an emotional day.
And you don't have to decide anything right now.
I've made my decision.
You have so much in your life, Olive.
Are you just gonna let that all disappear?
And be replaced by what?
Memories of a life that you didn't live?
Yes.
Well, how long do we have?
I don't know.
Neither does Walter.
Hm.
Well, my mother used to say:
"Encourage the quest for happiness in your children.
Even if it takes them very far away from you."
When the day comes if I don't remember this I want you to try and build something with me again.
Don't give up on me.
Mm.
I love you, Nina.
I love you, Olive.
Thank you.
For what?
They hid the universe from me.
They locked me out.
- You mean the other Observers?
- Yes.
What I led you to is a beacon.
I needed you to activate it so I could find my way back.
So I helped you.
Then I need you to help me now.
I have tried everything that I can think of everything I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked.
And nobody here can help me.
But you can.
I know you can.
Please help me get back home.
You have been home all along.
I don't understand.
I was erased.
There is no scientific explanation.
But I have a theory based on an uniquely human principle.
I believe you could not be fully erased because the people who care about you would not let you go.
And you would not let them go.
I believe you call it love.
And Olivia?
She is your Olivia.
English
- US
- SDH
He's an Observer.
They only show up at significant events.
He wants to go into the Observer's mind.
I do not have long.
I need you to do something for me.
Walter.
How can she have memories of my Olivia's life clearer than her own?
No matter how badly I want my Olivia back I can't make this one have memories.
I think you are, even without meaning to.
And it's wrong, Peter.
I don't understand what's happening.
If you look into my eyes you can see I am her.
- No.
I know she's out there.
My Olivia in my timeline.
I'm sorry, I think it's better if I just stay away.
The whole world is on fire.
Starting with my office.
We've had to completely reevaluate all our security measures after what that woman did.
The truth is, I wanted to give you time to collect your thoughts.
I know when there's something you wanna talk about.
I'm in love with Peter.
I know it sounds absurd to you.
I hardly know him but it's like I've known him my entire life.
And everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.
When Walter told me what you were going through...
Two sets of memories, two sets of experiences.
- He said the Cortexiphan dosing might be enabling you to remember things Peter wants you to remember.
But I can remember things Peter couldn't have known.
Like details of cases that he wasn't on, or names.
Places that he's never been.
I mean, how can that be, if he's controlling it?
I don't know how this is happening but I'm scared.
We're gonna figure out what's happening with you, Olive.
And as for your feelings about Peter all wounds heal over time.
Yeah.
I just wish that time would move a little quicker.
That's a coincidence, because we just filed the patent on that last week.
It's good to be with you.
We should do this more often.
What's wrong?
We always have breakfast together on Saturday mornings.
We were here last week.
Are you saying you don't remember?
I'm worried.
You're having these experiences at what cost?
I'll talk to Walter.
Hey, Jane, it's Celia.
God, it was a beautiful service.
I know this is impossible to make sense of.
We love you, Janey.
We're here for you.
If you need anything, please call us.
Who are you?
What do you want?
No, please, no!
No, please, no!
No!
No!
- Olivia.
- Hello, Walter.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Is everything all right?
- I've run out of MM's but I want to show you something.
I ordered this on the Interweb to keep an eye on our cleaning crew.
- A teddy bear?
- A Ted E. Bear-Witness.
It has a camera.
To my surprise, this inadvertently recorded the event between Peter and our bald man in the lab.
Come.
What do you see?
I see him disappear and then the table get knocked over.
Look again.
Do you see the blip?
Okay, I saw it then.
I believe something happened here that was undetectable to the human eye.
- Ah.
They're back from MIT.
- What did I just pick up, Walter?
There were a lot of security precautions.
It's an apparatus designed to slow down video.
The playback rate is so decelerated, that you can actually see light particles.
Well, come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I was gonna come and talk to Walter but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.
Astro, my waffle iron blew this fuse.
This is Dunham.
Jane Hall.
She was found by her sister.
- That's severe bruising.
- Those aren't bruises.
The skin had a reaction to chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.
- Why are we here?
- This is the second killing in a month where a woman's had the same marks.
Both were recently widowed.
The husbands died under mysterious circumstances.

Something I was told a long time ago.
But it is very strange to hear you say it.
- Hm.
- What is it?
There's something in there.
It's got writing on it.
It's an address.
2281/2 Morrow Street.
It's amazing.
I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.
You think this would've etched itself into my brain?
Organic ocular suggestion.
You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.
- Dr. Bishop?
- What?
Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- "Jane Hall."

I think it's better if I just stay away.
The whole world is on fire, starting with my office.
We've had to completely reevaluate all our security measures after what that woman did.
The truth is...
I wanted to give you time to collect your thoughts.
I know when there's something you want to talk about.
I'm in love with Peter.
I know it sounds absurd to you.
I hardly know him.
But it's like I've known him my entire life.
And everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.
When Walter told me what you were going through-- two sets of memories, two sets of experiences-- he said the Cortexiphan dosing might be enabling you to remember things that Peter wants you to remember.
But I can remember things that Peter couldn't have known, like details of cases that he wasn't on or names, um, places he's never been.
I mean, how can that be if--if he's controlling it?
I don't know how this is happening, but...
I'm scared.
We're gonna figure out what's happening with you, Olive.
Now, as for your feelings about Peter, all wounds heal over time.
Yeah.
I just wish the time would move a little quicker.
Well, that's a coincidence, because we just filed a patent on that last week.
It's good to be with you.
We should do this more often.
What's wrong?
We always have breakfast together on Saturday mornings.
We were here last week.
Are you saying you don't remember?
I'm worried.
You're having these experiences at what cost?
I'll talk to Walter.

Olivia.
- Hello, Walter.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Is everything all right?
- I've run out of MMs.
But I want to show you something.
I ordered this on the interweb to keep an eye on our cleaning crew.
- A teddy bear?
- A teddy bear-witness.
It has a camera.
To my surprise, this inadvertently recorded the event between Peter and our bald man in the lab.
Come.
What do you see?
I see him disappear and then the table get knocked over.
Uh-huh.
Look again.
Do you see the blip?
Okay, I saw it then.
I believe something happened here that was undetectable to the human eye.
Ah!
They're back from M.I.T.
What did I just pick up, Walter?
There were a lot of security precautions.
It's an apparatus designed to slow down video.
The playback rate is so deccelerated that you can actually see light particles.
Come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I was gonna come and talk to Walter, but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.
Astro, my waffle iron blew its fuse.
Uh, this is Dunham.
Jane Hall-- she was found by her sister.
That's severe bruising.
Those aren't bruises.
The victim's skin had a reaction to some type of chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.
So why are we here?
This is the second killing in a month where a woman has had the same marks.
Both were recently widowed.
And the husbands died under mysterious circumstances.
The bodies were dumped in fields, completely dehydrated.
As a matter of fact, Ms. Hall had just arrived home from her husband Mark's funeral when she was killed.
Okay, so we know that the killer is targeting couples.
There's one more thing.
In both cases, DNA of the deceased husbands was found on the victims' necks.
You're saying that both widows were killed by their dead mates?
It appears that's what the evidence is saying.
But her husband's body was only exhumed 15 minutes ago.
Oh, my.
Hello?
Peter, I need you here immediately--where are you?
I'm in a cab on my way to the bus station.
Bus station?
Where are you going?
New York.
You wanted me to stay away from her, remember?
And a bus is as good a mode of transportation as any when you're trying to get out of town.
You didn't tell me.
Anyway, you must come back to the lab at once.
Why, what's going on?
I think the observer may have done something to your eye.
Whatever he did, it wasn't seen by the other observers.
All I care about is what he's done to you.
So what's in New York?
I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York--
Olivia.
I admire you, Peter.
And why is that, Walter?
I told you what the right thing, ethically, was to do... leaving Olivia...
But I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it myself.
Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?
It's a... particularly obtuse way to admit that you're a better man than I am.
Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy.
Is that Greek?
Yeah.
Yeah, it means be a better man than your father.
It's something I was told a long time ago.
But it is very strange to hear you say it.
Hmm.
What is it?
There's something in there.
It's got writing on it.
It's an address.
228 1/2 Morrow Street.
It's amazing.
I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course, would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.
You think this would have etched itself into my brain?
Organic ocular suggestion.
You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.
Dr. Bishop?
What?
Agent Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- Jane Hall.
I think it's a case, Walter.
Oh.
Oh, oh, right.
Well, fine.
Bring the poor dear down and put her on the slab.
The human body is composed of 60% water.
However, Mr. Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.
He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.
Among other things that are lost with such... dehydration... are pheromones.
It wasn't only Mr. hall's DNA found on his widow's neck.
Specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's pheromones, which is what's causing the burning on the victim's neck.
Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?
They control our moods, our appetites...
Who we give our hearts to.
So he's targeting couples, killing the male, extracting the pheromones.
Do you think that he's trying to win the female?
A love potion?
Possibly.
Mm...
I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.
Okay.
I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations, see if I can get their files pulled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.
I made him get off the bus to New York.
But you didn't know that.
That he was on his way to New York?
No.
Where is he now?
Thank you, dear.
Walter, my memories are slipping.
They're disappearing.
Your own memories?
You said to me they're in the back of your mind.
Well, I didn't tell anybody that it was happening, because if Peter was gonna be with me, then I didn't think about the consequences.
I just didn't care.
But it's getting worse, Walter, whatever it is that's happening.
And I want you to try and stop it.
I want you to see if you can reverse it.
I just--I want to go back to who I was.
Olivia...
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I'll think of something.
I can do that, if you want.
Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Oh, he's so cute.
I don't know about cute.
This is Omar.
Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you two look so in love.
Beautiful.
- Oh, it's great.
- Perfect.
You guys from around here?
Yeah, Brooklyn.
Come on, Oliver.
All right.
- Well, take care.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Andrew, be sure to get the lake in the background.
I could take that picture for you, if you want.
Smell this.
Walter, what is that?
It is putrid!
Mortius bestia-- roadkill.
Specifically, an aromatic excretion from the castor sacs of the North American beaver used primarily for marking and mating.
I went beaver hunting in eastern Canada in the '70s.
Of course, in those days,
"beaver" meant something else entirely.
Walter, why would you make me wear this and smell roadkill?
Because I have been smelling things for the past hour, and I've lost my objectivity.
Now are you gonna help me or not?
Okay, take a look at these.
These are statements from friends and family.
The one thing that they said about both couples is that they had great, solid, loving marriages.
So?
So maybe he's targing couples that personify the kind of love that he wants.
What?
Nothing.
Are you okay?
I mean, with all you've been through in the past few days...
You know, if you ever... need anything...
I'm here.
I know.
Um, Walter wants to know which of you has fearless nasal passages.
For thousands of years, perfume makers have used a single disparate, rancid note to counterbalance all of the other sweet and unctuous scents in a fragrance.
The ancient Mesopotamians used fish oil.
The Greeks used animal carcass.
The Egyptians used afterbirth.
But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.
You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?
No.
But like perfume, the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex...
Does contain a rancid note.
I found this on Jane Hall's neck, mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.
It's an ingredient called castoreum.
- Hmm?
- Uh-uh.
Anyway, we can trace it.
It is not easy to get.
I only found five perfume manufacturers that use it.
You guys can work these, and I'll take these.
- Hey, Astrid.
- Hey.
Where are you?
We're just leaving Scentax.
We're on our way to KJS next.
Forget about that place.
Empire World Fragrance fired one of its employees a few months ago for theft.
Guess what he stole.
Castoreum.
Do you have an address?
Let me out!

Clear!
It's still warm.
He was just here.
Olivia.
He's married.
"Andrew Sutter, age 36.
212 Piedmont Ave., Milton."
Okay, I'm gonna call Broyles, tell him we know who the next victim's going to be.
It's okay.
We're with the FBI.
- My name is Agent Olivia Dunham.
- What--what are you doing?
Are you Dianna Sutter?
Last time I spoke to Andrew was this morning.
His car's in the shop today.
I told him to get a ride home from work because...
Because I was too busy.
Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.
We're in position.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
You must have loved each other very much.
We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown.
This August, it... would have been 15 years.
We were best friends in college.
He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another.
He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen...
What I was looking for.
He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them.
It's different, you know.
But people get tired... of looking and hoping.
Maybe he's taking his time.
Like he did with Jane Hall.
Or maybe he was never coming here at all.
This guy targets couples in love.
You heard her talking about her marriage.
Why would Carr pick them?
Mrs. Sutter, is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?
How did you know?
Do you know her name?
W-what are you doing in my house?
Shh...
No!
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
No, please, God!
No!
Help me!
Shh.
Help me!
Shh, shh.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Aah!
Let her go!
Move away from her.
Do you know how much pain you caused?
I don't want you to think that I did it for me.
I mean, not just for me.
We're not meant to be alone.
It's every human being's right to know love.
And had I succeeded...
Had I found the right chemicals-- just the right... balance...
I could have given the world... what you have.
What do I have?
Love.
I can smell that you're in love.
I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I was just making some tea.
How are you feeling?
I'm okay.
I talked to Walter.
What did he say?
It doesn't matter.
I met a woman today.
She'd just lost her husband, and as she was talking about him and her marriage, as much as she wanted to be, she--she wasn't in love.
As I was listening to her...
I realized what she was saying.
She had let go of the possibility of love... of finding love.
And I could see myself in her.
I didn't like who I was.
Now, all of these... memories and feelings that I'm experiencing, they're from a--a better version of me.
I've decided to let things run their course.
Oh, you had an emotional day, and you don't have to decide anything right now.
I've made my decision.
You have so much in your life, Olive.
Are you just gonna let that all disappear?
And be replaced by what?
Memories...of a life that you didn't live?
Yes.
Well, how long do we have?
I don't know.
Neither does Walter.
Hmm.
Well, my mother used to say,
"Encourage the quest for happiness in your children, even if it takes them very far away from you."
When the day comes... if I don't remember this...
I want you to try and build something with me again.
Don't give up on me.
I love you, Nina.
I love you, Olive.
Thank you.
For what?
They hid the universe from me.
They locked me out.
- You mean the other observers.
- Yes.
What I led you to is a beacon.
I needed you to activate it so I could find my way back.
So I helped you.
Then I need you to help me now.
I have tried everything that I can think of... everything that I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked.
And nobody here can help me.
But you can.
I know you can.
Please... help me get back home.
You have been home all along.
I don't understand.
I was erased.
There is no scientific explanation.
But...
I have a theory based on a uniquely human principle.
I believe you could not be fully erased because the people who care about you would not let you go.
And you... would not let them go.
I believe you call it "love."
And Olivia?
She is your Olivia.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
He's an observer.
They only show up at significant events.
That he's here must mean it's important.
Previously on Fringe... (Walter) He wants to go into the observer's mind.
I do not have long.
I need you to do something for me.
Walter.
How can she have memories of my Olivia's life that are clearer to her than her own?
No matter how badly I want my Olivia back,
I can't make this one have memories she didn't experience.
(Walter) I think you are.
Even without meaning to.
And it's wrong, Peter.
I don't understand what's happening to me, but if you look into my eyes, you can see that I am her.
No.
I know she's out there...

I'm sorry.
I think it's better if I just stay away.

- No!
Help me!
- Shh.
- Help me!
- Shh, shh.
[Muffled cries]
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Aah!
(Olivia) Let her go!
Move away from her.
[Gasping]
Do you know how much pain you caused?
I don't want you to think that I did it for me.
I mean, not just for me.
We're not meant to be alone.
It's every human being's right to know love.
And had I succeeded...
Had I found the right chemicals...
just the right... balance...
I could have given the world... what you have.
What do I have?
Love.
I can smell that you're in love.
(Nina) I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I was just making some tea.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
I talked to Walter.
What did he say?
It doesn't matter.
I met a woman today.
She'd just lost her husband, and as she was talking about him and her marriage, as much as she wanted to be, she... she wasn't in love.
As I was listening to her...
I realized what she was saying.
She had let go of the possibility of love... of finding love.
And I could see myself in her.
I didn't like who I was.
Now, all of these... memories and feelings that I'm experiencing, they're from a...
A better version of me.
I've decided to let things run their course.
Oh, you had an emotional day, and you don't have to decide anything right now.
I've made my decision.
You have so much in your life, Olive.
Are you just gonna let that all disappear?
And be replaced by what?
Memories... of a life that you didn't live?
Yes.
Well, how long do we have?
I don't know.
Neither does Walter.
Hmm.
Well, my mother used to say,
"Encourage the quest for happiness in your children, even if it takes them very far away from you."
When the day comes...
If I don't remember this...
I want you to try and build something with me again.
Don't give up on me.
I love you, Nina.
I love you, Olive.
Thank you.
For what?
They hid the universe from me.
They locked me out.
- You mean the other observers.
- Yes.
What I led you to is a beacon.
I needed you to activate it so I could find my way back.
So I helped you.
Then I need you to help me now.
I have tried everything that I can think of...
Everything that I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked.
And nobody here can help me.
But you can.
I know you can.
Please...
Help me get back home.
You have been home all along.
I don't understand.
I was erased.
There is no scientific explanation.
But...
I have a theory based on a uniquely human principle.
I believe you could not be fully erased because the people who care about you would not let you go.
And you... would not let them go.
I believe you call it "love."
And Olivia?
She is your Olivia.
[Loud rumbling]
He's an Observer.
They only show up at significant events.
That he's here must mean it's important.
Previously on Fringe...
He wants to go into the Observer's mind.
I do not have long.
I need you to do something for me.
Walter.
How can she have memories of my Olivia's life that are clearer to her than her own?
No matter how badly I want my Olivia back,
I can't make this one have memories she didn't experience.
I think you are.
Even without meaning to.
And it's wrong, Peter.
I don't understand what's happening to me, but if you look into my eyes, you can see that I am her.
No.
I know she's out there-- my Olivia in my timeline.
I'm sorry.
I think it's better if I just stay away.
The whole world is on fire, starting with my office.
We've had to completely reevaluate all our security measures after what that woman did.
The truth is...
I wanted to give you time to collect your thoughts.
I know when there's something you want to talk about.
I'm in love with Peter.
I know it sounds absurd to you.
I hardly know him.
But it's like I've known him my entire life.
And everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.
When Walter told me what you were going through-- two sets of memories, two sets of experiences-- he said the Cortexiphan dosing might be enabling you to remember things that Peter wants you to remember.
But I can remember things that Peter couldn't have known, like details of cases that he wasn't on or names, um, places he's never been.
I mean, how can that be if--if he's controlling it?
I don't know how this is happening, but...
I'm scared.
We're gonna figure out what's happening with you, Olive.
Now, as for your feelings about Peter, all wounds heal over time.
Yeah.
I just wish the time would move a little quicker.
Well, that's a coincidence, because we just filed a patent on that last week.
It's good to be with you.
We should do this more often.
What's wrong?
We always have breakfast together on Saturday mornings.
We were here last week.
Are you saying you don't remember?
I'm worried.
You're having these experiences at what cost?
I'll talk to Walter.

Olivia.
- Hello, Walter.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Is everything all right?
- I've run out of MMs.
But I want to show you something.
I ordered this on the interweb to keep an eye on our cleaning crew.
- A teddy bear?
- A teddy bear-witness.
It has a camera.
To my surprise, this inadvertently recorded the event between Peter and our bald man in the lab.
Come.
What do you see?
I see him disappear and then the table get knocked over.
Uh-huh.
Look again.
Do you see the blip?
Okay, I saw it then.
I believe something happened here that was undetectable to the human eye.
Ah!
They're back from M.I.T.
What did I just pick up, Walter?
There were a lot of security precautions.
It's an apparatus designed to slow down video.
The playback rate is so deccelerated that you can actually see light particles.
Come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I was gonna come and talk to Walter, but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.
Astro, my waffle iron blew its fuse.
Uh, this is Dunham.
Jane Hall-- she was found by her sister.
That's severe bruising.
Those aren't bruises.
The victim's skin had a reaction to some type of chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.
So why are we here?
This is the second killing in a month where a woman has had the same marks.
Both were recently widowed.
And the husbands died under mysterious circumstances.
The bodies were dumped in fields, completely dehydrated.
As a matter of fact, Ms. Hall had just arrived home from her husband Mark's funeral when she was killed.
Okay, so we know that the killer is targeting couples.
There's one more thing.
In both cases, DNA of the deceased husbands was found on the victims' necks.
You're saying that both widows were killed by their dead mates?
It appears that's what the evidence is saying.
But her husband's body was only exhumed 15 minutes ago.
Oh, my.
Hello?
Peter, I need you here immediately--where are you?
I'm in a cab on my way to the bus station.
Bus station?
Where are you going?
New York.
You wanted me to stay away from her, remember?
And a bus is as good a mode of transportation as any when you're trying to get out of town.
You didn't tell me.
Anyway, you must come back to the lab at once.
Why, what's going on?
I think the Observer may have done something to your eye.
Whatever he did, it wasn't seen by the other Observers.
All I care about is what he's done to you.
So what's in New York?
I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York--
Olivia.
I admire you, Peter.
And why is that, Walter?
I told you what the right thing, ethically, was to do... leaving Olivia...
But I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it myself.
Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?
It's a... particularly obtuse way to admit that you're a better man than I am.
Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy.
Is that Greek?
Yeah.
Yeah, it means be a better man than your father.
It's something I was told a long time ago.
But it is very strange to hear you say it.
Hmm.
What is it?
There's something in there.
It's got writing on it.
It's an address.
228 1/2 Morrow Street.
It's amazing.
I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course, would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.
You think this would have etched itself into my brain?
Organic ocular suggestion.
You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.
Dr. Bishop?
What?
Agent Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- Jane Hall.
I think it's a case, Walter.
Oh.
Oh, oh, right.
Well, fine.
Bring the poor dear down and put her on the slab.
The human body is composed of 60% water.
However, Mr. Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.
He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.
Among other things that are lost with such... dehydration... are pheromones.
It wasn't only Mr. hall's DNA found on his widow's neck.
Specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's pheromones, which is what's causing the burning on the victim's neck.
Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?
They control our moods, our appetites...
Who we give our hearts to.
So he's targeting couples, killing the male, extracting the pheromones.
Do you think that he's trying to win the female?
A love potion?
Possibly.
Mm...
I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.
Okay.
I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations, see if I can get their files pulled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.
I made him get off the bus to New York.
But you didn't know that.
That he was on his way to New York?
No.
Where is he now?
Thank you, dear.
Walter, my memories are slipping.
They're disappearing.
Your own memories?
You said to me they're in the back of your mind.
Well, I didn't tell anybody that it was happening, because if Peter was gonna be with me, then I didn't think about the consequences.
I just didn't care.
But it's getting worse, Walter, whatever it is that's happening.
And I want you to try and stop it.
I want you to see if you can reverse it.
I just--I want to go back to who I was.
Olivia...
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I'll think of something.
I can do that, if you want.
Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Oh, he's so cute.
I don't know about cute.
This is Omar.
Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you two look so in love.
Beautiful.
- Oh, it's great.
- Perfect.
You guys from around here?
Yeah, Brooklyn.
Come on, Oliver.
All right.
- Well, take care.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Andrew, be sure to get the lake in the background.
I could take that picture for you, if you want.
Smell this.
Walter, what is that?
It is putrid!
Mortius bestia-- roadkill.
Specifically, an aromatic excretion from the castor sacs of the North American beaver used primarily for marking and mating.
I went beaver hunting in eastern Canada in the '70s.
Of course, in those days,
"beaver" meant something else entirely.
Walter, why would you make me wear this and smell roadkill?
Because I have been smelling things for the past hour, and I've lost my objectivity.
Now are you gonna help me or not?
Okay, take a look at these.
These are statements from friends and family.
The one thing that they said about both couples is that they had great, solid, loving marriages.
So?
So maybe he's targing couples that personify the kind of love that he wants.
What?
Nothing.
Are you okay?
I mean, with all you've been through in the past few days...
You know, if you ever... need anything...
I'm here.
I know.
Um, Walter wants to know which of you has fearless nasal passages.
For thousands of years, perfume makers have used a single disparate, rancid note to counterbalance all of the other sweet and unctuous scents in a fragrance.
The ancient Mesopotamians used fish oil.
The Greeks used animal carcass.
The Egyptians used afterbirth.
But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.
You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?
No.
But like perfume, the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex...
Does contain a rancid note.
I found this on Jane Hall's neck, mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.
It's an ingredient called castoreum.
- Hmm?
- Uh-uh.
Anyway, we can trace it.
It is not easy to get.
I only found five perfume manufacturers that use it.
You guys can work these, and I'll take these.
- Hey, Astrid.
- Hey.
Where are you?
We're just leaving Scentax.
We're on our way to KJS next.
Forget about that place.
Empire World Fragrance fired one of its employees a few months ago for theft.
Guess what he stole.
Castoreum.

He was just here.
Olivia.
He's married.
"Andrew Sutter, age 36.
212 Piedmont Ave., Milton."
Okay, I'm gonna call Broyles, tell him we know who the next victim's going to be.
It's okay.
We're with the FBI.
- My name is Agent Olivia Dunham.
- What--what are you doing?
Are you Dianna Sutter?
Last time I spoke to Andrew was this morning.
His car's in the shop today.
I told him to get a ride home from work because...
Because I was too busy.
Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.
We're in position.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
You must have loved each other very much.
We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown.
This August, it... would have been 15 years.
We were best friends in college.
He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another.
He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen...
What I was looking for.
He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them.
It's different, you know.
But people get tired... of looking and hoping.
Maybe he's taking his time.
Like he did with Jane Hall.
Or maybe he was never coming here at all.
This guy targets couples in love.
You heard her talking about her marriage.
Why would Carr pick them?
Mrs. Sutter, is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?
How did you know?
Do you know her name?

But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.
You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?
No.
But like perfume, the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex... does contain a rancid note.
I found this on Jane Hall's neck, mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.
It's an ingredient called castoreum.
- Hmm?
- Uh-uh.
Anyway, we can trace it.
It is not easy to get.
I only found five perfume manufacturers that use it.
You guys can work these, and I'll take these.
- Hey, Astrid.
- Hey.
Where are you?
We're just leaving Scentax.
We're on our way to KJS next.
Forget about that place.
Empire World Fragrance fired one of its employees a few months ago for theft.
Guess what he stole.
Castoreum.
Do you have an address?
Let me out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Clear!
It's still warm.
He was just here.
Olivia.
He's married.
"Andrew Sutter, age 36.
212 Piedmont Ave., Milton."
Okay, I'm gonna call Broyles, tell him we know who the next victim's going to be.
It's okay.
We're with the FBI.
- My name is Agent Olivia Dunham.
- What... what are you doing?
Are you Dianna Sutter?
Last time I spoke to Andrew was this morning.
His car's in the shop today.
I told him to get a ride home from work because...
Because I was too busy.
Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.
We're in position.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
You must have loved each other very much.
We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown.
This August, it...
Would have been 15 years.
We were best friends in college.
He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another.
He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen...
What I was looking for.
He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them.
It's different, you know.
But people get tired... of looking and hoping.
Maybe he's taking his time.
Like he did with Jane Hall.
Or maybe he was never coming here at all.
This guy targets couples in love.
You heard her talking about her marriage.
Why would Carr pick them?
Mrs. Sutter, is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?
How did you know?
Do you know her name?
W-what are you doing in my house?
- Shh...
- No!
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
No, please, God!
- No!
Help me!
- Shh.
- Help me!
- Shh, shh.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Aah!
Let her go!
Move away from her.
Do you know how much pain you caused?
I don't want you to think that I did it for me.
I mean, not just for me.
We're not meant to be alone.
It's every human being's right to know love.
And had I succeeded...
Had I found the right chemicals...
just the right... balance...
I could have given the world... what you have.
What do I have?
Love.
I can smell that you're in love.
I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I was just making some tea.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
I talked to Walter.
What did he say?
It doesn't matter.
I met a woman today.
She'd just lost her husband, and as she was talking about him and her marriage, as much as she wanted to be, she... she wasn't in love.
As I was listening to her...
I realized what she was saying.
She had let go of the possibility of love... of finding love.
And I could see myself in her.
I didn't like who I was.
Now, all of these... memories and feelings that I'm experiencing, they're from a...
A better version of me.
I've decided to let things run their course.
Oh, you had an emotional day, and you don't have to decide anything right now.
I've made my decision.
You have so much in your life, Olive.
Are you just gonna let that all disappear?
And be replaced by what?
Memories... of a life that you didn't live?
Yes.
Well, how long do we have?
I don't know.
Neither does Walter.
Hmm.
Well, my mother used to say,
"Encourage the quest for happiness in your children, even if it takes them very far away from you."
When the day comes...
If I don't remember this...
I want you to try and build something with me again.
Don't give up on me.
I love you, Nina.
I love you, Olive.
Thank you.
For what?
They hid the universe from me.
They locked me out.
- You mean the other observers.
- Yes.
What I led you to is a beacon.
I needed you to activate it so I could find my way back.
So I helped you.
Then I need you to help me now.
I have tried everything that I can think of...
Everything that I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked.
And nobody here can help me.
But you can.
I know you can.
Please...
Help me get back home.
You have been home all along.
I don't understand.
I was erased.
There is no scientific explanation.
But...
I have a theory based on a uniquely human principle.
I believe you could not be fully erased because the people who care about you would not let you go.
And you... would not let them go.
I believe you call it "love."
And Olivia?
She is your Olivia.
He is an observer.
They only show up at significant events.
That he's here must mean it's important.
Previously on Fringe... (Walter) He wants to go into the observer's mind.
I do not have long.
I need you to do something for me.
Walter.
How can she have memories of my Olivia's life that are clearer to her than her own?
No matter how badly I want my Olivia back,
I can't make this one have memories she didn't experience.
(Walter) I think you are.
Even without meaning to.
And it's wrong, Peter.
I don't understand what's happening to me, but if you look into my eyes, you can see that I am her.
No.
I know she's out there...
My Olivia in my timeline.
I'm sorry.
I think it's better if I just stay away.
[Dialogue inaudible]
The whole world is on fire, starting with my office.
We've had to completely reevaluate all our security measures after what that woman did.
The truth is...
I wanted to give you time to collect your thoughts.
I know when there's something you want to talk about.
I'm in love with Peter.
I know it sounds absurd to you.
I hardly know him.
But it's like I've known him my entire life.
And everybody, including him, keeps telling me that it's impossible.
When Walter told me what you were going through...
Two sets of memories, two sets of experiences...
He said the Cortexiphan dosing might be enabling you to remember things that Peter wants you to remember.
But I can remember things that Peter couldn't have known, like details of cases that he wasn't on or names, um, places he's never been.
I mean, how can that be if... if he's controlling it?
I don't know how this is happening, but...
I'm scared.
We're gonna figure out what's happening with you, Olive.
Now, as for your feelings about Peter, all wounds heal over time.
Yeah.
I just wish the time would move a little quicker.
Well, that's a coincidence, because we just filed a patent on that last week.
It's good to be with you.
We should do this more often.
What's wrong?
We always have breakfast together on Saturday mornings.
We were here last week.
Are you saying you don't remember?
I'm worried.
You're having these experiences at what cost?
I'll talk to Walter.
[Answering machine beeps]
(Celia) Hey, Jane, it's Celia.
God, it was a beautiful service...
[Ominous music]
* *
If you need anything, please call us.
[Answering machine beeps]
Who are you?
What do you want?
[Grunts]
No, please don't!
No, please don't!
[Whimpering]
[Grunts] No...
No!
No!
[Grunts]
[Gasping, grunting]
(Walter) Olivia.
- Hello, Walter.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Is everything all right?
- I've run out of MMs.
But I want to show you something.
I ordered this on the interweb to keep an eye on our cleaning crew.
- A teddy bear?
- A teddy bear-witness.
It has a camera.
To my surprise, this inadvertently recorded the event between Peter and our bald man in the lab.
Come.
[Keys clack] What do you see?
I see him disappear and then the table get knocked over.
Uh-huh.
Look again.
Do you see the blip?
Okay, I saw it then.
I believe something happened here that was undetectable to the human eye.
Ah!
They're back from MIT.
What did I just pick up, Walter?
There were a lot of security precautions.
It's an apparatus designed to slow down video.
The playback rate is so deccelerated that you can actually see light particles.
Come on, Tommy, let's see what we can find on that tape.
How are you feeling?
I'm fine.
I was gonna come and talk to Walter, but his mind is firmly somewhere else at the moment.
Astro, my waffle iron blew its fuse.
[Cell phone rings]
Uh, this is Dunham.
(Broyles) Jane Hall...
She was found by her sister.
- That's severe bruising.
- Those aren't bruises.
The victim's skin had a reaction to some type of chemical residue left by the assailant's hands.
So why are we here?
This is the second killing in a month where a woman has had the same marks.
Both were recently widowed.
And the husbands died under mysterious circumstances.
(Broyles) The bodies were dumped in fields, completely dehydrated.
As a matter of fact, Ms. Hall had just arrived home from her husband Mark's funeral when she was killed.
Okay, so we know that the killer is targeting couples.
There's one more thing.
In both cases, DNA of the deceased husbands was found on the victims' necks.
You're saying that both widows were killed by their dead mates?
It appears that's what the evidence is saying.
But her husband's body was only exhumed 15 minutes ago.
Oh, my.
[Cell phone vibrates] Hello?
Peter, I need you here immediately...
Where are you?
I'm in a cab on my way to the bus station.
Bus station?
Where are you going?
(Peter) New York.
You wanted me to stay away from her, remember?
And a bus is as good a mode of transportation as any when you're trying to get out of town.
You didn't tell me.
Anyway, you must come back to the lab at once.
Why, what's going on?
I think the observer may have done something to your eye.
(Peter) Whatever he did, it wasn't seen by the other observers.
All I care about is what he's done to you.
So what's in New York?
I told you, Walter, it's what's not in New York...
Olivia.
I admire you, Peter.
[Grunts]
[Chuckles] And why is that, Walter?
I told you what the right thing, ethically, was to do... leaving Olivia... but I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it myself.
Is that your way of thanking me for taking your advice?
It's a... particularly obtuse way to admit that you're a better man than I am.
Einai kalytero anthropo apo ton patera toy.
Is that Greek?
Yeah.
Yeah, it means be a better man than your father.
It's something I was told a long time ago.
But it is very strange to hear you say it.
Hmm.
What is it?
There's something in there.
It's got writing on it.
(Peter) It's an address.
(Walter) 228 1/2 Morrow Street.
It's amazing.
I suspect this message, if left alone to run its course, would have fully dissolved, taking its place firmly in your mind's eye.
You think this would have etched itself into my brain?
(Walter) Organic ocular suggestion.
You wouldn't be aware, but you would be irresistibly compelled to visit.
(Man) Dr. Bishop?
What?
Agent Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- Jane Hall.
I think it's a case, Walter.
Oh.
Oh, oh, right.
Well, fine.
Bring the poor dear down and put her on the slab.
[Omino* *music]
(Walter) The human body is composed of 60% water.
However, Mr. Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.
He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.
Among other things that are lost with such...
[Grunts] dehydration... are pheromones.
It wasn't only Mr. Hall's DNA found on his widow's neck.
Specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's pheromones, which is what's causing the burning on the victim's neck.
Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?
They control our moods, our appetites... who we give our hearts to.
So he's targeting couples, killing the male, extracting the pheromones.
Do you think that he's trying to win the female?
A love potion?
Possibly.
[Crunching]
Mm...
I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.
Okay.
I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations, see if I can get their files pulled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.
I made him get off the bus to New York.
But you didn't know that.
That he was on his way to New York?
No.
Where is he now?
[Doorknob creaks]
Thank you, dear.
Walter, my memories are slipping.
They're disappearing.
Your own memories?
You said to me they're in the back of your mind.
Well, I didn't tell anybody that it was happening, because if Peter was gonna be with me, then I didn't think about the consequences.
I just didn't care.
But it's getting worse, Walter, whatever it is that's happening.
And I want you to try and stop it.
I want you to see if you can reverse it.
I just...
I want to go back to who I was.
Olivia...
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I'll think of something.
(Man) I can do that, if you want.
Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Oh, he's so cute.
I don't know about cute.
This is Omar.
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, you two look so in love.
Beautiful.
- Oh, it's great.
- Perfect.
You guys from around here?
Yeah, Brooklyn.
(Woman) Come on, Oliver.
[Woman chuckles]
All right.
[Woman chuckles]
- Well, take care.
(Man)
- Thank you.
Thanks.
(Woman) Andrew, be sure to get the lake in the background.
I could take that picture for you, if you want.
Smell this.
[Inhales deeply]
[Coughs]
Walter, what is that?
It is putrid!
Mortius bestia...
Roadkill.
Specifically, an aromatic excretion from the castor sacs of the North American beaver used primarily for marking and mating.
I went beaver hunting in eastern Canada in the '70s.
Of course, in those days,
"beaver" meant something else entirely.
Walter, why would you make me wear this and smell roadkill?
Because I have been smelling things for the past hour, and I've lost my objectivity.
Now are you gonna help me or not?
Okay, take a look at these.
These are statements from friends and family.
The one thing that they said about both couples is that they had great, solid, loving marriages.
So?
So maybe he's targing couples that personify the kind of love that he wants.
What?
Nothing.
[Clears throat]
Are you okay?
I mean, with all you've been through in the past few days...
You know, if you ever... need anything...
I'm here.
I know.
[Knocks on door]
Um, Walter wants to know which of you has fearless nasal passages.
For thousands of years, perfume makers have used a single disparate, rancid note to counterbalance all of the other sweet and unctuous scents in a fragrance.
The ancient mesopotamians used fish oil.
The greeks used animal carcass.
The Egyptians used afterbirth.
But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.
You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?
No.
But like perfume, the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex... does contain a rancid note.
I found this on Jane Hall's neck, mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.

[Inhales sharply]
[Soft beeping]
[Beeping continues]
[Cell phone rings]
- Hey, Astrid.
- Hey.
Where are you?
We're just leaving Scentax.
We're on our way to KJS next.
Forget about that place.
Empire World Fragrance fired one of its employees a few months ago for theft.
Guess what he stole.
Castoreum.
Do you have an address?
Let me out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
[Machine humming]
[Dramatic pop music plays]
* *
Clear!
It's still warm.
He was just here.
Olivia.
He's married.
"Andrew Sutter, age 36.
212 Piedmont Ave., Milton."
Okay, I'm gonna call Broyles, tell him we know who the next victim's going to be.
[Device beeping]
[Beeping increases, stops]
[Rumbling]
[Gasps] It's okay.
We're with the FBI.
- My name is Agent Olivia Dunham.
- What... what are you doing?
Are you Dianna Sutter?
Last time I spoke to Andrew was this morning.
[Sniffles]
His car's in the shop today.
I told him to get a ride home from work because...
[Voice breaking] Because I was too busy.
Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.
We're in position.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
You must have loved each other very much.
We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown.
This August, it...
Would have been 15 years.
We were best friends in college.
He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another.
He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen...
What I was looking for.
He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them.
It's different, you know.
But people get tired... of looking and hoping.
Maybe he's taking his time.
Like he did with Jane Hall.
Or maybe he was never coming here at all.
This guy targets couples in love.
You heard her talking about her marriage.
Why would Carr pick them?
Mrs. Sutter, is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?
How did you know?
Do you know her name?
W-what are you doing in my house?
[Shouts]
- Shh...
- No!
[Screaming]
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[Stops screaming]
No, please, God!
- No!
Help me!
- Shh.
- Help me!
- Shh, shh.
[Muffled cries]
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Aah!
(Olivia) Let her go!
Move away from her.
[Gasping]
Do you know how much pain you caused?
I don't want you to think that I did it for me.
I mean, not just for me.
We're not meant to be alone.
It's every human being's right to know love.
And had I succeeded...
Had I found the right chemicals...
just the right... balance...
I could have given the world... what you have.
What do I have?
Love.
I can smell that you're in love.
(Nina) I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I was just making some tea.

Agent Farnsworth said to bring her in if we were here first.
- Who is she?
- Jane Hall.
I think it's a case, Walter.
Oh.
Oh, oh, right.
Well, fine.
Bring the poor dear down and put her on the slab.
The human body is composed of 60% water.
However, Mr. Hall's body was drained of almost all moisture.
He was literally killed by extreme dehydration.
Among other things that are lost with such... dehydration... are pheromones.
It wasn't only Mr. Hall's DNA found on his widow's neck.
Specifically, it was a very concentrated solution of Mark's pheromones, which is what's causing the burning on the victim's neck.
Why would somebody concentrate pheromones?
They control our moods, our appetites... who we give our hearts to.
So he's targeting couples, killing the male, extracting the pheromones.
Do you think that he's trying to win the female?
A love potion?
Possibly.
Mm...
I would like to examine the first victims he did this to.
Okay.
I will get the ball rolling on the exhumations, see if I can get their files pulled.
Oh, I'm sorry.
They're Peter's.
I made him get off the bus to New York.
But you didn't know that.
That he was on his way to New York?
No.
Where is he now?
Thank you, dear.
Walter, my memories are slipping.
They're disappearing.
Your own memories?
You said to me they're in the back of your mind.
Well, I didn't tell anybody that it was happening, because if Peter was gonna be with me, then I didn't think about the consequences.
I just didn't care.
But it's getting worse, Walter, whatever it is that's happening.
And I want you to try and stop it.
I want you to see if you can reverse it.
I just...
I want to go back to who I was.
Olivia...
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I'll think of something.
I can do that, if you want.
Really?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Oh, he's so cute.
I don't know about cute.
This is Omar.
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, you two look so in love.
Beautiful.
- Oh, it's great.
- Perfect.
You guys from around here?
Yeah, Brooklyn.
Come on, Oliver.
All right.
- Well, take care.
- Thank you.
Thanks.
Andrew, be sure to get the lake in the background.
I could take that picture for you, if you want.
Smell this.
Walter, what is that?
It is putrid!
Mortius bestia...
Roadkill.
Specifically, an aromatic excretion from the castor sacs of the North American beaver used primarily for marking and mating.
I went beaver hunting in eastern Canada in the '70s.
Of course, in those days,
"beaver" meant something else entirely.
Walter, why would you make me wear this and smell roadkill?
Because I have been smelling things for the past hour, and I've lost my objectivity.
Now are you gonna help me or not?
Okay, take a look at these.
These are statements from friends and family.
The one thing that they said about both couples is that they had great, solid, loving marriages.
So?
So maybe he's targing couples that personify the kind of love that he wants.
What?
Nothing.
Are you okay?
I mean, with all you've been through in the past few days...
You know, if you ever... need anything...
I'm here.
I know.
Um, Walter wants to know which of you has fearless nasal passages.
For thousands of years, perfume makers have used a single disparate, rancid note to counterbalance all of the other sweet and unctuous scents in a fragrance.
The ancient mesopotamians used fish oil.
The greeks used animal carcass.
The Egyptians used afterbirth.
But used in proportion so that the human nose cannot detect the unique odor.
You're saying our suspect is making a perfume?
No.
But like perfume, the chemical compound that our perpetrator is using to lure the opposite sex... does contain a rancid note.
I found this on Jane Hall's neck, mixed with the pheromones of her dead mate.
It's an ingredient called castoreum.
- Hmm?
- Uh-uh.
Anyway, we can trace it.
It is not easy to get.
I only found five perfume manufacturers that use it.
You guys can work these, and I'll take these.
- Hey, Astrid.
- Hey.
Where are you?
We're just leaving Scentax.
We're on our way to KJS next.
Forget about that place.
Empire World Fragrance fired one of its employees a few months ago for theft.
Guess what he stole.
Castoreum.
Do you have an address?
Let me out!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Clear!
It's still warm.
He was just here.
Olivia.
He's married.
"Andrew Sutter, age 36.
212 Piedmont Ave., Milton."
Okay, I'm gonna call Broyles, tell him we know who the next victim's going to be.
It's okay.
We're with the FBI.
- My name is Agent Olivia Dunham.
- What... what are you doing?
Are you Dianna Sutter?
Last time I spoke to Andrew was this morning.
His car's in the shop today.
I told him to get a ride home from work because...
Because I was too busy.
Believe me when I tell you that we are going to make sure that he doesn't hurt you or anybody else.
We're in position.
Now what?
Now we wait.
Just keep looking straight ahead.
You must have loved each other very much.
We were married the summer after our senior year at Brown.
This August, it...
Would have been 15 years.
We were best friends in college.
He was always helping me get over a broken heart from one boy or another.
He couldn't understand why I kept letting it happen...
What I was looking for.
He couldn't really understand the difference between loving someone and being in love with them.
It's different, you know.
But people get tired... of looking and hoping.
Maybe he's taking his time.
Like he did with Jane Hall.
Or maybe he was never coming here at all.
This guy targets couples in love.
You heard her talking about her marriage.
Why would Carr pick them?
Mrs. Sutter, is it possible that your husband may have been having an affair?
How did you know?
Do you know her name?
W-what are you doing in my house?
- Shh...
- No!
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
No, please, God!
- No!
Help me!
- Shh.
- Help me!
- Shh, shh.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- Aah!
Let her go!
Move away from her.
Do you know how much pain you caused?
I don't want you to think that I did it for me.
I mean, not just for me.
We're not meant to be alone.
It's every human being's right to know love.
And had I succeeded...
Had I found the right chemicals...
just the right... balance...
I could have given the world... what you have.
What do I have?
Love.
I can smell that you're in love.
I was wondering when I'd hear from you.
I was just making some tea.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
I talked to Walter.
What did he say?
It doesn't matter.
I met a woman today.
She'd just lost her husband, and as she was talking about him and her marriage, as much as she wanted to be, she... she wasn't in love.
As I was listening to her...
I realized what she was saying.
She had let go of the possibility of love... of finding love.
And I could see myself in her.
I didn't like who I was.
Now, all of these... memories and feelings that I'm experiencing, they're from a...
A better version of me.
I've decided to let things run their course.
Oh, you had an emotional day, and you don't have to decide anything right now.
I've made my decision.
You have so much in your life, Olive.
Are you just gonna let that all disappear?
And be replaced by what?
Memories... of a life that you didn't live?
Yes.
Well, how long do we have?
I don't know.
Neither does Walter.
Hmm.
Well, my mother used to say,
"Encourage the quest for happiness in your children, even if it takes them very far away from you."
When the day comes...
If I don't remember this...
I want you to try and build something with me again.
Don't give up on me.
I love you, Nina.
I love you, Olive.
Thank you.
For what?
They hid the universe from me.
They locked me out.
- You mean the other observers.
- Yes.
What I led you to is a beacon.
I needed you to activate it so I could find my way back.
So I helped you.
Then I need you to help me now.
I have tried everything that I can think of...
Everything that I know how to do to get back home, and none of it has worked.
And nobody here can help me.
But you can.
I know you can.
Please...
Help me get back home.
You have been home all along.
I don't understand.
I was erased.
There is no scientific explanation.
But...
I have a theory based on a uniquely human principle.
I believe you could not be fully erased because the people who care about you would not let you go.
And you... would not let them go.
I believe you call it "love."
And Olivia?
She is your Olivia.
My head.
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil.
How you been?
Move.
Move.
I said move.
First of all, A, I'm a cop.
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.
Doesn't it get itchy?
Sweaty?
The paper.
Even though your face is covered, I can tell, you need a hug.
- Back off.
- Come on.
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.
No love?
Really?
You coming?
- What did I do?
- How should I know?
You gonna pick that up?
Hurry, I gotta go to court.
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come on, man.
You can't look me up for walking down the street.
Guy with the persuader pointed at my head?
I don't know that guy.
- What's in the paper?
- News.
Newspaper.
Wallet.
And the gun.
Okay, easy tiger.
What's with the paper?
This is a really unsatisfying conversation.
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?
Better than you.
He took my money.
And when you tell me what I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.
Off to dance with Lady Justice.
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.
I've always been lucky.
Hey.
What the hell?
Firearm.
Thank you, sir.
You're Lena Valoise.
I was.
Tomorrow, Again is one of my favorite movies.
Me too.
- Nick.
- How do you do?
Great.
What are you doing here?
I've come to see my son, the assistant DA.
Me too.
- You must be very proud.
- I must.
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.
- You look a little lost.
- I am.
Courtroom 3?
Come.
I'll show you.
We call it the thin blue line, the police.
The fragile barrier between the bad guys and you.
We give policemen like Detective Nick Blades guns.
We pay them well.
And all we ask in return is that they do what they swear they'll do.
Protect and serve.
But what happens if they break that promise?
What happens if one day you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys?
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold care to join us in this case?
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.
Anarchy.
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.
- Mr. Gold ...
- You know what?
I still do.
I believe there is such a thing as right and wrong.
I believe in an irrepressible commitment to the truth.
An irreproachable moral and ethical code that cannot be compromised.
Detective Blades thought he could be the law, but not follow it.
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.
That's wrong.
Thank you.
We will adjourn for the day.
First time he called the police on me he was 9.
- What'd you do?
- I took away his LEG-Os.
Mr. Gold.
Your reaction to the DA's decision to retire?
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.
Do you have any comments on a frontrunner for the interim slot?
I've been dealing with police corruption.
It doesn't leave a lot of time to deal with office personnel matters.
Do you plan on attending Willie Van Beber's execution?
I did my job, ...putting Willie Van Beber right where he belongs.
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner take it from there.
Excuse me.
You people don't mind if I borrow my son, the assistant DA, do you?
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.
You sure you don't have an announcement to make?
Your father is having an affair.
Would you and the good Lord care to comment on that?
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?
Every time you say Dad's having sex with someone else.
Go to the country house.
Where's the van?
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.
I thought we'd agree we only use the Hawk in an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1:30.
Honey, this car represents the last fragile thread of dignity holding my family together.
Take my car.
Park in my spot.
Theo.
I thought on people's birthdays, other people are supposed to do what they want.
And I thought turning 40 meant not acting 7.
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch with the next DA.
Great.
And you'll still earn less than our gardener and I'll still be paying for lunch with my parents' credit card.
Jeez, Kelly, come on.
Don't do this.
Just give me today.
You're the one who wants to live in a house big enough for 12.
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.
I'm leaving.
I'm not done yet.
Leaving you.
Actually, you're the one leaving since my parents own the house.
I'll give you one week to get your things and get out.
Today you do this?
Today?
On my birthday?
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years I've wasted on someone going precisely nowhere?
Kelly, come on.
Wait a minute.
What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.
Really?
And how many hours do you spend with them on any given week?
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you three times what the DA's job pays.
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.
I believe in what I do.
Is that so wrong?
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?
Yeah?
Okay.
They want me back.
- Right away, sir.
- Good.
Because I don't.
I'm sorry.
Please remember to put the cover back on the Hawk.
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.
I've received the following note from the jurors.
"We have voted several times.
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.
Would you like to set the matter for retrial?
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
Blades?
I don't care what the jury did.
You're on leave until you deal with Internal Affairs.
Do you hear me?
Until I say so, you are not police.
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA, they're gonna rush out and get my name tattooed across their butt cheeks.
- Give me five.
- Nice going.
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?
Was in Interview 4, but Schaefer needed the room so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate?
I'm buying.
You're buying?
Or is Gil buying?
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.
He was carrying the paper the cash when I popped him.
Then some ape in a wool ski mask came at me with a piece.
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?
There's numbers and letters circled all over it.
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.
I tried to decipher it but Gold's closing was distracting.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
I'll go sit on Gil.
Blades strikes me as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.
He's dirty.
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.
Yes, exactly.
We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.
I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.
Trust cops to deal with cops?
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.
Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?
Turns out, it's mostly grays.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.
Am I supposed to see the forest or mostly grays?
Look, everything I know comes from you.
A much younger and stupider me.
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.
Good.
Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.
You're kidding?
Grant Stone?
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.
And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.
So do the judges.
Most of the defense bar.
I should start caring about defense lawyers?
Everybody in the system gets chewed up, Theo.
Including the poor bastards we send to prison.
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--
Theo.
Take some time off.
Go home.
Look in the mirror.
I need Gil Ott for an interview.
- Not here.
- Where is he?
Check again.
Detective Schaefer brought him earlier.
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want?
I just came on.
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.
What the crap?
Come on.
What's up with the sneak attack?
License, registration, proof of insurance.
I'm a DA.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
License.
My registration.
Have you had anything to drink tonight, Mr. Gould, is it?
It's Gold.
Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.
Mn Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.
If you do not calm down, I will have to place you under arrest.
Are you joking?
What is all this about?
- Please step out of the can
- No.
Mr. Gold, please step out of the vehicle now.
I am placing you under arrest.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.
- No, I'm not.
- You are derfinitely resisting arrest.
What are you talking about?
If you continue to resist arrest, I will Tase you.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.
Make the call.
Let's go 10-99.
Detective Nick Blades there's something shocking you should see, State and Chestnut.
Get the hell away from me.
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.
Just leave me alone.
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.
I've seen Tomorrow, Again like 50 times.
Please don't speak to me.
What happened?
Two policemen kidnapped and Tased me.
Friends of yours, I presume.
I've never been Tased myself.
Imagine the worst dental appointment of all time.
You got lucky, detective.
It won't happen again.
I've always been lucky.
Today's my birthday.
I hope it's the best one ever.
Kelly!
No, no.
Don't do this to me.
Kelly.
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead apparently, your precious Hawk is missing and you may remember, I'm going to my parents until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.
Just give me a little more time to explain to the kids.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys.
Daddy loves you.
See you soon.
This asshole must be having the worst day of his life.
He just called in to report that someone stole his car out of his driveway.
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?
You know what happens when you wake up in the morning and you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad?
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.
Anarchy.
And the Cubs win the World Series.
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.
We've done our share of fooling around over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.
It's time for him to hang up his sword and die with something approaching dignity.
Mom, I don't need to hear this.
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.
I thought it was the cancer, so I didn't push.
But now I know.
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.
What time are you picking us up for lunch?
Theo?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.
- So take the van.
-It's dead.
Again?
All right, you have my permission to use the Hawk, just be very careful.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What's wrong with the Hawk?
I don't believe this.
I gotta go.
If something happens to that automobile, it'll kill your father.
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.
Move out of the street.
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.
Please move out of the street or I'll have to cite you.
I'm bleeding here.
I'm bleeding here.
Move now.
My car was stolen.
I saw the guy driving it around the corner two minutes ago.
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh?
Shocking.
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.
I don't see anything.
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.
You know, I'm about to go off shift if you want a ride downtown.
Thank you.
Okay, Blades, so now you're buying two dinners.
And not the whole Foods deli again, either.
Someplace where they bring food to the table.
Let's see what you got, then we'll decide.
Well, it was code.
Forensics figures it for driver's license numbers.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep.
And it's four local Louisiana plates.
It's just that there are three extra letters.
WVB or BVW, depending on how you read it.
But one of the cars is registered to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.
If we have the list and Gil's in jail, how does the oar get stolen?
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.
Check with Schaefer and Chin.
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses on my way to Gil's.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
Blades.
Goddamn it.
If you're out there impersonating a police officer, I will pinch you myself.
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.
In the meantime, I'm having my teeth cleaned and maybe a trim.
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.
So as soon as we can unplug an officer from another matter, we'll be with you.
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor and tell him to come out here now.
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
I understand that my reputation precedes me.
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour my car was stolen, and I just want a little help.
That's all.
Despite the fact you've been trying to put one of my best cops in jail I find this conversation scintillating.
You, in fact, may describe it as electrifying.
- How you doing?
- Good.
I'm detective Nick Blades, New Orleans police.
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.
- Your parents home?
- No.
- They at work?
- No.
- I give up.
Where are they?
- Dead.
My grandma says that if she was on the jury she'd vote to send you to jail.
I guess I'm glad your grandma's not on the jury.
My grandma says you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am.
Your grandma take care of you?
- Yeah.
- Is she home?
No.
Is that your grandma's car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?
- Yeah.
- Is he home?
- No.
- Where's he?
- Jail.
Does he get out soon?
My grandma said it depends if his jury is as dumb as yours.
Tell your grandma to lock the car up tight.
All right.
- Hand over the money already.
-It's not like it's because you got nothing.
Yeah, well.
It's okay, guys.
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot?
He just said that.
Never heard of you.
Let 's see it.
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.
Enjoy.
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know.
Ask him.
What you want with Gil?
Where is the little creep?
After he robbed 400 off me, he didn't leave no forwarding address.
- You see him with this guy?
- No.
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?
All I know is, last time I saw him, he was okay.
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.
I chose Olive Garden.
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?
Thank you.
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.
I also took that off Gil.
Call 911.
Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.
I'm sure they'll find it.
But with my luck, somebody will probably have peed in it.
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.
Well, also in the meantime my wife is taking away my kids, my car was stolen and because of Blades, I'm getting no help from the cops.
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.
I should have listened.
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.
That's much better than rotting teeth.
You mentioned the Van Beber case.
Here's the murder book.
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.
And everyone was mad at me for not dealing.
The judge was mad at me for ruining his summer vacation.
The boss didn't want me tied up for three months.
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.
Plead it.
Settle it.
Compromise.
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.
Grab that, will you?
- Hello?
- Kelly you get your husband on the phone right now.
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger about our problems like it's CNN.
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly he insisted We come to your house.
When you weren't here, he got very upset and locked himself in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?
Apparently.
He must've had it in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.
You can buy guns in vending machines now.
- Call the cops.
- No.
I will not have some SWAT team blasting through the door scaring your father to death.
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I gotta go.
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.
Where'd you get those tickets?
Kinko's?
Nice pants.
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?
He's been threatening to kill himself for the last 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.
Herb, I want the truth.
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.
Along with everything else, he's cheating.
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?
Herb.
What did you do?
- Wait.
- Marty.
Holy moly.
Put down the gun.
- Oh, Lord.
Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.
He's not well, Nick.
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky.
He won't shoot Marty.
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.
You need a haircut.
I said I'd stay with him in sickness and in health.
Now he's sick and I'm staying.
But I can't abide the cheating.
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.
Just follow him.
I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?
I heard about your son's car being stolen, thought I could help.
What car?
- Oh, my God.
The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.
Detective Blades happened to stop by and everything's under control.
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.
He's agreed to help find the car.
And the other matter?
Forget the other matter for the moment.
You and Theo find the Hawk.
I'll do everything I can to keep this from your father.
I'll expect regular reports.
- She wants reports.
- I heard.
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.
This is a very comfortable mattress.
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.
Kelly bought it.
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?
Same reason everybody buys one.
It's a crazy world out there, son.
And I got like 30 percent off.
Don't you tell your mother.
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.
Am I dreaming this or is your Uncle Marty here?
Uncle Marty?
Of course, he had to leave.
Took my gun.
I think that's probably for the best.
Theo, your mother has to try this mattress.
I mean, it is incredible.
You should try it.
Come on.
Try it.
Come on.
Yeah.
So?
It is. it's a great mattress.
It is sublime is what it is.
Yeah.
It's nice.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck.
Monday, on a ship.
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.
Trust me, you're not getting any play from the department.
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.
You get your way, I'm gonna need all the money I can scrape together.
I'm not dropping the charges, even if you do find the car.
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.
- You know him?
- How would I know him?
Gil was carrying a newspaper with plates numbers written in code on it.
Your plate number was on the list.
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye on the Hawk. it's a very nice car.
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.
I wasted every weekend of my childhood working on that damn car.
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.
I get it.
So, what do we do?
We go see Ott, you slap him around a little he tells us where my car is?
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court, so I had to park him.
While you were blasting me in front of the jury, he slipped.
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.
But I'll assume that he delivered a copy of the list once he got out.
So how do we find my oar?
How should I know?
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.
Although, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.
Don't do that.
What--?
What--?
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?
I'm a lawyer.
My mind is my weapon.
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me long before I find your car.
Come on.
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.
Why are we here?
Come on, let's go.
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.
Gentlemen, we honor the master and the practice by bowing when we enter the dojo.
We're police.
You Edward Mackie?
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.
Are you insane?
Ever see that scene in Indiana Jones where he watches some guy with a big sword do his thing and then shoots him?
In this situation, I'm Indy.
Move.
Now.
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--
Move.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Theodore, put thing down before you kill someone.
Hey.
Hey, give me a break.
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?
It's already in the book.
Thanks for everything.
That's why those people are so widely despised.
There's no give and take.
No compromise.
What does any of this have to do with my car?
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.
In prison, he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect, looking for Gil at his father's place.
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names before I do more good deeds.
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning.
He's in jail.
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?
The boy's running so he must have burned somebody.
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.
I seem to recall something about my mother paying you to find my car?
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?
Possibly.
There seems to be a connection between gangs and the list.
Before I was chief assistant, I did head up the gang prosecution unit.
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?
- Really.
-Isn't he about to be executed?
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on, move, move.
- You, too.
- Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.
No, thanks.
You're like a walking cliché.
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.
Brother Blades.
So nice to see you.
Happy, this is my partner, Roberto Clemente.
The sainted ballplayer. it's my honor.
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott and he ends up locked up.
You know anything about that?
I heard some old guys kicked the shit out him.
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.
Give me six maple, two glazed, and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.
And I'll need the paper back when you're done reading it.
It's like warm maple syrup being poured over your tongue.
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.
Why do they never see that coming?
What a waste of 50 grand.
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.
That one on the list?
Yep.
It's mine.
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.
Yeah.
I'll make sure to use my Club.
That was my guy yesterday, outside the bar.
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.
Why a wool mask in July?
I was hoping to grab Gil before he delivered the paper.
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.
No, the paper wasn't for me.
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily bad reputation, Blades.
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor convicts on the four yard at Angola.
I was one of them.
It was a social club.
I understand you've since diversified considerably.
And like all other complex organizations, we have our internal differences.
The newspaper was a delivery from Willie Van Beber to a pro hitter, identity unknown.
You know who Van Beber is?
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.
He's running out of time.
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?
I believe I do.
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.
I need Gil because he's the one that can ID the person out on the street taking orders from Van Beber.
- Still with me?
- Yeah.
If you hadn't popped Gil, I'd have his contact and it would be over.
I'm genuinely sorry.
I had no idea my nose was in your business.
- Yeah.
These things happen.
- So where's Ed?
Ed's dead.
Or will be shortly.
And you better keep your eye on your little pal Roberto the DA because if he's not on the list, he will be.
You know he's the one that put Willie down.
He's on the list.
Like I said, find Gil.
Get his contact, take him off the street, or feed him to me.
Then, hopefully, Van Beber will go to his great reward and I'll get back to my goddamn doughnuts.
- Blades.
-It's not cars. it's bodies.
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
I mind.
You're putting my life at risk and those of everyone around you.
Idiot!
Hey, I'm back.
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?
How many non-Whole Foods dinners am I up to?
I'm going to prison soon.
Two of out of the three have federal jackets.
Happy Conners is a Snitch?
That's hard to believe.
Negative. it's Ed Mackie and Dean Nickerson are the informants.
- Which agency?
- FBI.
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy named Willie Van Beber.
Know him?
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.
Very soon.
This is his last hurrah.
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber the names of the informants.
Who has access to the FBI informant database?
Anyone senior in this department or in any other in the region, state or federal.
Why is Gold on the list though?
I'm sure there's more than a few who wanna smoke Gold.
I expect it's because he put Van Beber on death row.
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?
No, we put this out there, our leaky cop evaporates.
True.
Glass finds out I'm working this, he'll have a coronary.
I don't need that.
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?
- Come on!
What are you doing?
- No.
Come on!
Dude!
You coming?
Five-0 in the house.
Was that really necessary?
I keep my love of food and my professional life separate.
- Fatty.
- Blades.
Give me a slab to go with the sauce on the side.
I heard you paid off that jury.
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.
Along with my order, I'll need an address on Gil Ott.
I don't know no Gil.
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.
And I do know me a Bill.
Theodore, assume for a moment most of the people in this place are on parole, probation or otherwise in the system.
How long would it take for me to find out one of them is in possession of a gun resulting in their immediate and protracted incarceration?
You ain't even no police.
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Feel free to call me any time within the next five minutes.
Yeah.
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.
Most importantly, what does any of it have to do with finding my car?
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.
Talk to me.
Thanks, Fatty.
I owe you.
Hey.
You can't just go and do whatever you want in life, Blades.
There are systems and rules.
These systems and rules exist for a reason.
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.
And not once have you just cut a corner, just bent a little.
You know what the United States Supreme Court says?
United States Supreme Court says a prosecutor is a representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy.
No, sir.
As a prosecutor, I am the representative of our sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective my solemn obligation is not to win cases, but to do justice.
I make one wrong move, I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.
It's very tiring to be around you.
You just bought a slab of ribs.
You kidding me?
The last time I ate at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.
This place rocks.
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?
I'm feeling really lost.
Can you try and explain to me what's happening?
Your car look anything like that?
That's it.
I don't believe this.
That's it.
That's my car.
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.
Give me the keys.
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear on how important that oar is to my father.
To me.
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
-It's not.
I need to find that car, Blades.
My family is gone, my career is shit, my mother's insane and my father's dying.
The one thing I got half a chance of doing is finding that car.
And if you can't or won't help me, then goddamn it, I will do it myself.
Get off.
Get off.
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.
Hello?
I'm kidnapped.
Here, here.
This is why this country's going in the toilet.
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.
I just saw him.
Called from the trunk of his car after you told me about the list.
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk?
What happened?
A pro, for sure.
You were right about Mackie, he was working for us.
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.
Mackie would have put him down forever.
I was actually figuring Happy for the body.
I don't think so.
Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.
- You know Willie Van Beber?
-4-4 number-one shot caller?
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.
Van Beber's settling up before he gets executed.
They wanna kill each other, it's fine with me.
Start smoking my informants, I get annoyed.
I mean, Mackie means we lose two ongoing investigations.
He made the list for putting Van Beber on the row.
- How nice.
Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.
After you get your delivery boy, plug the damn leak.
We're not even looking for my oar.
I doubt we ever were.
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?
These things take time.
Have faith.
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.
I don't understand.
Why are we waiting?
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we just go in and get Gil Ott now?
Fools rush in, my friend.
I hate golf.
Other than working on the Hawk, this was the one thing my father and I did together.
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs around people's necks.
You just have to relax.
H ow?
Before you swing, breathe.
Okay, time's up.
I'll go get him.
If Gil Ott's in there, you think my car is nearby?
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
Until about two seconds ago, pretty good.
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?
- Out where?
- Jail.
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead.
Okay?
Paper had the name of 4-4's, two of which were federal snitches.
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
It also had the name of a DA named Theo Gold, who also happens to be a friend.
You get the needle for whacking a DA.
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.
You're the only one who can ID the source which is why I assume you're whacked out in this caddy shack shit hole.
That's just rude.
I live here.
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.
Everybody wants you, Gil.
Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
Sit down.
I need your contact.
One name.
Give me that name and maybe I'll let you live so you can remodel.
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.
Back inside.
Now!
You want me to go after them or get those off you?
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.
Did you ask about the car?
I forgot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Nothing nine Band-Aids and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.
I did predict you'd shoot me.
I remember.
I decided I wanted to live more than I want my car.
My father will understand that.
I'll take you home.
Just drop me off at my parents'.
I'll break the news.
I can already see his face.
God, I'd do anything to avoid that slightly disappointed but not altogether surprised look.
You know the look?
Please.
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old daughter I see one weekend a month.
I know the look.
Theo, go get him before one of the neighbors calls the police.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- What are you doing?
Call you in a bit.
I can't tell whether I'm being guarded or surveilled.
Your little redheaded co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really?
Why?
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on.
That's ridiculous.
She can go to any private firm in this city and make five times what she's making.
She doesn't need to sell informant data for money, okay?
- You want me to call her?
Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore.
Maybe later.
My mother wants you to come in for my belated birthday dinner.
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?
Can you do the entire Valoise family a favor and just stay off the subject?
Please?
Did you know that Robert Evans was our neighbor for a while in California?
Of course, that was before he became huge.
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.
Apparently not so incredible that he cast me in anything.
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.
Sonny and Cher.
Bobby Redford.
Bobby had a terrible overbite.
Tell me again.
Who are you?
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.
That is very interesting.
Your son's a great lawyer.
We would have preferred if he had gone into dentistry but you give them wings, they fly away.
You know how it is, Marty.
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.
That was before anyone told me about his, you know, style.
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it?
Thank you.
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.
I used to think I had one.
Now I realize I burned it down without even knowing.
Homes get rebuilt.
All I wanted was to spend whatever time my dad has left driving around with him in the Hawk.
- Pulling plugs.
You know?
- And sending me to prison.
I figured this is the time to be a good son.
After, I'd try to be a better husband and father.
Tell me about your daughter.
She lives with her mom.
All the money I skimmed from the detective busts went toward her school.
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.
I feel horrible about it.
You expect me to drop the case because you have the same problems that everybody else does.
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.
People get divorced and pay for braces all the time without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.
They lack opportunity.
Maybe.
I mean, my wife's family has money.
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.
You still can't tell me what we've been doing for the past day?
For the moment, no.
And the car is safely on its way to Argentina.
Bon voyage, old friend.
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.
Tomorrow, Again, again and again and again.
-It's a great movie.
- Yeah.
She's not your mother.
What's that about your mother?
Theo was just telling me that Lena's not my mother.
You didn't know that?
I told you, detective, my father dropped me off at the hotel.
I was alone.
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.
- I can't help it.
- Try.
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.
He was there with you.
He used three capital letters to sign for the drink.
WMP.
William McPherson.
Why do you hate me?
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.
That scene kills me every time.
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.
- WVB?
- Yeah.
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.
Makes sense, but we figured it came from him.
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl and she says Gil snitched for her in a possession case last yean
So she felt like she owed him a favor.
Gil gave her some story about the hold being trumped up.
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.
Check and see if Van Beber has any kids.
Nick, what the heck are you doing in there?
- I gotta go.
Just check.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?
You say you'll bring it back and I nod like a robot?
I'll take him.
Just let me get this.
Yo.
Detective Blades?
it's Rosalyn Wohl.
- Yes?
- Who is that?
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?
He says he'll give you the guy who's killing the people on the list.
All right.
Where?
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.
Just do what he says.
- What does Gil want?
- The list.
-Why?
- If he gets the list back his employer refrains from putting a bullet in his ear.
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.
You don't have the list.
Happy took it.
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?
You know all those bad people you sent to prison?
They ever call to say thanks?
No.
Sometimes I send people to prison for doing bad things.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people.
I appreciate that.
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?
Apparently his last wish is for you to precede him to the promised land.
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo.
Too dangerous.
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car.
Don't give me a gun.
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.
- You trust me?
- I trust you.
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.
- Yeah.
- Happy.
Blades.
If you're not too busy making doughnuts I could use some backup.
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?
Well, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?
- Gold, yes.
Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.
Let's go.
Now.
Come on.
You're staying with me.
Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
- Wonderful.
Hands on your head.
Hands.
Come on.
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?
I don't know.
Am I supposed to know?
Oh, shit.
Call 911 and stay with the car.
-911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.
I ran into your father, Gil.
- He's worried about you.
- My father?
That's funny.
That's really-- That's hilarious.
- where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.
Bullshit.
Give me the goddamn paper.
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.
And you don't really need it anyway.
Hands up on your head.
I'm really sorry about the way this ends, detective.
I had such a good time watching you in trial.
You were the happiest defendant I've ever seen.
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.
You know you were right.
About the list?
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.
You're not the first to say so, although you may be the last.
Thought that kidnapping thing sounded fishy.
I knew you'd respond to a lady in distress.
That's no way to treat an employee.
Independent contractor.
I thought I was doing you a favor though, killing Gold.
He wants to put you away.
Once you know him, his intentions are good.
That's very magnanimous.
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.
So, yeah, sad story all around.
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.
Police!
A few of my dad's friends.
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.
Oh, shit.
Blades.
You could have put my father away for life.
Instead you had to kill him?
- I'm sorry.
I was just doing my job.
- No compromises.
No deals.
Right?
Well, guess what.
No deal for you either.
Don't move.
Yeah, well, Wohl was her mother's maiden name.
Van Beber never married her.
I hate to admit it, Blades, but you're not a half-bad detective.
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath the next 85 years.
Are we still on for Whole Foods?
You bet.
Want a ride to work in the morning?
Sure.
How very gallant of you.
Thanks.
-It's tomorrow.
- Again.
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.
That is good.
- That's bad.
- That is bad.
Still going after my dad for adultery?
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.
It's a fantasy.
He never cheated on her.
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God.
More fantasy.
Does my mother have any actual evidence of this affair?
Her theory is that he takes his girl or girls to this hotel.
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I found the car.
If the Hawk was supposed to be on its way to Argentina why did it keep popping up over town?
Excellent question.
You wouldn't expect a thief to steal it then tool around.
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.
Except when driving the Hawk.
He would never take a mistress to a swank hotel.
He would park the car in a hotel garage if it meant keeping it off the street.
Yes!
What do you say?
I get a turn at the wheel of this beauty?
All right, you've earned it.
You just go very easy, okay?
She likes to be rewed a lot before she downshifts.
- Taser boy?
- Yes?
Relax.
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.
You have to convince 12 jurors, including at least a few females.
Yes.
Yes.
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?
Letting you drive!
Apologize to your father for me.
Dad, I am really, really sorry.
Is he dead?
He never stood a chance against the Hawk.
Who is he?
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.
I guess killing his daughter didn't endear us to him.
We got lucky.
I've never been lucky.
Thanks.
For what?
Keeping me alive.
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.
So speaking of you sending me to prison ...
We were?
Admittedly, I've had some lapses of judgment.
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses here and there.
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.
Thanks for showing me the forest and the grays.
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?
What am I gonna tell my dad?
Tell him how much you love him.
The rest is pretty much paint by numbers.
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.
Son.
Hey.
Dad.
What time is it?
I have some bad news.
What?
Where's mom?
Oh, no, no, no. it's okay.
Mom is fine.
She's fine.
Now, look, Theo.
I don't want you to overreact or anything but it appears as if the Hawk has been stolen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.
Me?
That oar meant everything in the world to you.
Everything?
No, no, no.
It's a fine automobile but you know what I always say:
it's just a car.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.
We interviewed a few jurors after the mistrial they seemed pretty unimpressed, so we walked away.
But the fact that you decided to dismiss the case doesn't mean Detective Blades is innocent.
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.
I understand you spent time with Detective Blades looking for your car, which you reported stolen?
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.
Looks like you and Detective Blades had quite an adventure.
Detective Blades was instrumental in uncovering a damaging leak that was in our office.
A leak which had already resulted in the death of an FBI informant.
That's very impressive.
Look you knew at the time that Detective Blades was on administrative leave and he had specific orders not to do any police work.
My mother hired him as a PI to look for the car.
Which your father had.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
I bet Detective Blades went out of his way not to mislead anyone about his status.
He never flipped his badge, right?
Never brandished his gun?
Never once in your presence identified himself as a police officer?
Technically, no.
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
My head.
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil.
How you been?
Move.
Move.
I said move.
First of all, A, I'm a cop.
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.
Doesn't it get itchy?
Sweaty?
The paper.
Even though your face is covered, I can tell, you need a hug.
- Back off.
- Come on.
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.
No love?
Really?
You coming?
- What did I do?
- How should I know?
You gonna pick that up?
Hurry, I gotta go to court.
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come on, man.
You can't lock me up for walking down the street.
Guy with the persuader pointed at my head?
I don't know that guy.
- What's in the paper?
- News.
Newspaper.
Wallet.
And the gun.
Okay, easy tiger.
What's with the paper?
This is a really unsatisfying conversation.
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?
Better than you.
He took my money.
And when you tell me what I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.
Off to dance with Lady Justice.
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.
I've always been lucky.
Hey.
What the hell?
Firearm.
Thank you, sir.
You're Lena Valoise.
I was.
Tomorrow, Again is one of my favorite movies.
Me too.
- Nick.
- How do you do?
Great.
What are you doing here?
I've come to see my son, the assistant DA.
Me too.
- You must be very proud.
- I must.
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.
- You look a little lost.
- I am.
Courtroom 3?
Come.
I'll show you.
We call it the thin blue line, the police.
The fragile barrier between the bad guys and you.
We give policemen like Detective Nick Blades guns.
We pay them well.
And all we ask in return is that they do what they swear they'll do.
Protect and serve.
But what happens if they break that promise?
What happens if one day you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys?
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold care to join us in this case?
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.
Anarchy.
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.
- Mr. Gold....
- You know what?
I still do.
I believe there is such a thing as right and wrong.
I believe in an irrepressible commitment to the truth.
An irreproachable moral and ethical code that cannot be compromised.
Detective Blades thought he could be the law, but not follow it.
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.
That's wrong.
Thank you.
We will adjourn for the day.
First time he called the police on me he was 9.
- What'd you do?
- I took away his legos.
Mr. Gold.
Your reaction to the DA's decision to retire?
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.
Do you have any comments on a frontrunner for the interim slot?
I've been dealing with police corruption.
It doesn't leave a lot of time to deal with office personnel matters.
Do you plan on attending Willie Van Beber's execution?
I did my job putting Willie Van Beber right where he belongs.
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner take it from there.
Excuse me.
You people don't mind if I borrow my son, the assistant DA, do you?
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.
You sure you don't have an announcement to make?
Your father is having an affair.
Would you and the good Lord care to comment on that?
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?
Every time you say Dad's having sex with someone else.
Go to the country house.
Where's the van?
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.
I thought we'd agree we only use the Hawk in an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1 :30.
Honey, this car represents the last fragile thread of dignity holding my family together.
Take my car.
Park in my spot.
Theo.
I thought on people's birthdays, other people are supposed to do what they want.
And I thought turning 40 meant not acting 7.
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch with the next DA.
Great.
And you'll still earn less than our gardener and I'll still be paying for lunch with my parents' credit card.
Jeez, Kelly, come on.
Don't do this.
Just give me today.
You're the one who wants to live in a house big enough for 12.
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.
I'm leaving.
I'm not done yet.
Leaving you.
Actually, you're the one leaving since my parents own the house.
I'll give you one week to get your things and get out.
Today you do this?
Today?
On my birthday?
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years I've wasted on someone going precisely nowhere?
Kelly, come on.
Wait a minute.
What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.
Really?
And how many hours do you spend with them on any given week?
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you three times what the DA's job pays.
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.
I believe in what I do.
Is that so wrong?
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?
Yeah?
Okay.
They want me back.
- Right away, sir.
- Good.
Because I don't.
I'm sorry.
Please remember to put the cover back on the Hawk.
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.
I've received the following note from the jurors.
"We have voted several times.
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.
Would you like to set the matter for retrial?
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
Blades?
I don't care what the jury did.
You're on leave until you deal with Internal Affairs.
Do you hear me?
Until I say so, you are not police.
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA, they're gonna rush out and get my name tattooed across their butt cheeks.
- Give me five.
- Nice going.
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?
Was in Interview 4, but Schaefer needed the room so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate?
I'm buying.
You're buying?
Or is Gil buying?
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.
He was carrying the paper the cash when I popped him.
Then some ape in a wool ski mask came at me with a piece.
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?
There's numbers and letters circled all over it.
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.
I tried to decipher it but Gold's closing was distracting.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
I'll go sit on Gil.
Blades strikes me as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.
He's dirty.
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.
Yes, exactly.
We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.
I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.
Trust cops to deal with cops?
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.
Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?
Turns out, it's mostly grays.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.
Am I supposed to see the forest or mostly grays?
Look, everything I know comes from you.
A much younger and stupider me.
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.
Good.
Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.
You're kidding?
Grant Stone?
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.
And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.
So do the judges.
Most of the defense bar.
I should start caring about defense lawyers?
Everybody in the system gets chewed up, Theo.
Including the poor bastards we send to prison.
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--
Theo.
Take some time off.
Go home.
Look in the mirror.
I need Gil Ott for an interview.
- Not here.
- Where is he?
Check again.
Detective Schaefer brought him earlier.
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want?
I just came on.
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.
What the crap?
Come on.
What's up with the sneak attack?
License, registration, proof of insurance.
I'm a DA.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
License.
My registration.
Have you had anything to drink tonight, Mr. Gould, is it?
It's Gold.
Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.
Mr. Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.
If you do not calm down, I will have to place you under arrest.
Are you joking?
What is all this about?
- Please step out of the car.
- No.
Mr. Gold, please step out of the vehicle now.
I am placing you under arrest.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.
- No, I'm not.
- You are definitely resisting arrest.
What are you talking about?
If you continue to resist arrest, I will Tase you.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.
Make the call.
Let's go 10-99.
Detective Nick Blades there's something shocking you should see, State and Chestnut.
Get the hell away from me.
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.
Just leave me alone.
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.
I've seen Tomorrow, Again like 50 times.
Please don't speak to me.
What happened?
Two policemen kidnapped and Tased me.
Friends of yours, I presume.
I've never been Tased myself.
Imagine the worst dental appointment of all time.
You got lucky, detective.
It won't happen again.
I've always been lucky.
Today's my birthday.
I hope it's the best one ever.
Kelly!
No, no.
Don't do this to me.
Kelly.
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead apparently, your precious Hawk is missing and you may remember, I'm going to my parents until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.
Just give me a little more time to explain to the kids.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys.
Daddy loves you.
See you soon.
This asshole must be having the worst day of his life.
He just called in to report that someone stole his car out of his driveway.
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?
You know what happens when you wake up in the morning and you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad?
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.
Anarchy.
And the Cubs win the World Series.
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.
We've done our share of fooling around over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.
It's time for him to hang up his sword and die with something approaching dignity.
Mom, I don't need to hear this.
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.
I thought it was the cancer, so I didn't push.
But now I know.
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.
What time are you picking us up for lunch?
Theo?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.
- So take the van.
- It's dead.
Again?
All right, you have my permission to use the Hawk, just be very careful.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What's wrong with the Hawk?
I don't believe this.
I gotta go.
If something happens to that automobile, it'll kill your father.
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.
Move out of the street.
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.
Please move out of the street or I'll have to cite you.
I'm bleeding here.
I'm bleeding here.
Move now.
My car was stolen.
I saw the guy driving it around the corner two minutes ago.
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh?
Shocking.
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.
I don't see anything.
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.
You know, I'm about to go off shift if you want a ride downtown.
Thank you.
Okay, Blades, so now you're buying two dinners.
And not the Whole Foods deli again, either.
Someplace where they bring food to the table.
Let's see what you got, then we'll decide.
Well, it was code.
Forensics figures it for driver's license numbers.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep.
And it's four local Louisiana plates.
It's just that there are three extra letters.
WVB or BVW, depending on how you read it.
But one of the cars is registered to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.
If we have the list and Gil's in jail, how does the car get stolen?
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.
Check with Schaefer and Chin.
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses on my way to Gil's.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
Blades.
Goddamn it.
If you're out there impersonating a police officer, I will pinch you myself.
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.
In the meantime, I'm having my teeth cleaned and maybe a trim.
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.
So as soon as we can unplug an officer from another matter, we'll be with you.
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor and tell him to come out here now.
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
I understand that my reputation precedes me.
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour my car was stolen, and I just want a little help.
That's all.
Despite the fact you've been trying to put one of my best cops in jail I find this conversation scintillating.
You, in fact, may describe it as electrifying.
- How you doing?
- Good.
I'm detective Nick Blades, New Orleans police.
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.
- Your parents home?
- No.
- They at work?
- No.
- I give up.
Where are they?
- Dead.
My grandma says that if she was on the jury she'd vote to send you to jail.
I guess I'm glad your grandma's not on the jury.
My grandma says you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am.
Your grandma take care of you?
- Yeah.
- Is she home?
No.
Is that your grandma's car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?
- Yeah.
- Is he home?
- No.
- Where's he?
- Jail.
Does he get out soon?
My grandma said it depends if his jury is as dumb as yours.
Tell your grandma to lock the car up tight.
All right.
- Hand over the money already.
- It's not like it's because you got nothing.
Yeah, well.
It's okay, guys.
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot?
He just said that.
Never heard of you.
Let's see it.
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.
Enjoy.
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know.
Ask him.
What you want with Gil?
Where is the little creep?
After he robbed 400 off me, he didn't leave no forwarding address.
- You see him with this guy?
- No.
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?
All I know is, last time I saw him, he was okay.
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.
I chose Olive Garden.
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?
Thank you.
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.
I also took that off Gil.
Call 911.
Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.
I'm sure they'll find it.
But with my luck, somebody will probably have peed in it.
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.
Well, also in the meantime my wife is taking away my kids, my car was stolen and because of Blades, I'm getting no help from the cops.
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.
I should have listened.
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.
That's much better than rotting teeth.
You mentioned the Van Beber case.
Here's the murder book.
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.
And everyone was mad at me for not dealing.
The judge was mad at me for ruining his summer vacation.
The boss didn't want me tied up for three months.
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.
Plead it.
Settle it.
Compromise.
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.
Grab that, will you?
- Hello?
- Kelly you get your husband on the phone right now.
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger about our problems like it's CNN.
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly he insisted we come to your house.
When you weren't here, he got very upset and locked himself...
- ...in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?
Apparently.
He must've had it in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears...
- ...
like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.
You can buy guns in vending machines now.
- Call the cops.
- No.
I will not have some SWAT team blasting through the door scaring your father to death.
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I gotta go.
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.
Where'd you get those tickets?
Kinko's?
Nice pants.
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?
He's been threatening to kill himself for the last 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.
Herb, I want the truth.
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.
Along with everything else, he's cheating.
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?
Herb.
What did you do?
- Wait.
- Marty.
Holy moly.
Put down the gun.
- Oh, Lord.
Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.
He's not well, Nick.
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky.
He won't shoot Marty.
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.
You need a haircut.
I said I'd stay with him in sickness and in health.
Now he's sick and I'm staying.
But I can't abide the cheating.
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.
Just follow him.
I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?
I heard about your son's car being stolen, thought I could help.
What car?
- Oh, my God.
The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.
Detective Blades happened to stop by and everything's under control.
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.
He's agreed to help find the car.
And the other matter?
Forget the other matter for the moment.
You and Theo find the Hawk.
I'll do everything I can to keep this from your father.
I'll expect regular reports.
- She wants reports.
- I heard.
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.
This is a very comfortable mattress.
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.
Kelly bought it.
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?
Same reason everybody buys one.
It's a crazy world out there, son.
And I got like 30 percent off.
Don't you tell your mother.
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.
Am I dreaming this or is your Uncle Marty here?
Uncle Marty?
Of course, he had to leave.
Took my gun.
I think that's probably for the best.
Theo, your mother has to try this mattress.
I mean, it is incredible.
You should try it.
Come on.
Try it.
Come on.
Yeah.
So?
It is.
It's a great mattress.
It is sublime is what it is.
Yeah.
It's nice.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck.
Monday, on a ship.
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.
Trust me, you're not getting any play from the department.
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.
You get your way, I'm gonna need all the money I can scrape together.
I'm not dropping the charges, even if you do find the car.
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.
- You know him?
- How would I know him?
Gil was carrying a newspaper with plates numbers written in code on it.
Your plate number was on the list.
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye on the Hawk.
It's a very nice car.
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.
I wasted every weekend of my childhood working on that damn car.
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.
I get it.
So, what do we do?
We go see Ott, you slap him around a little he tells us where my car is?
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court, so I had to park him.
While you were blasting me in front of the jury, he slipped.
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.
But I'll assume that he delivered a copy of the list once he got out.
So how do we find my car?
How should I know?
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.
Although, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.
Don't do that.
What--?
What--?
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?
I'm a lawyer.
My mind is my weapon.
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me long before I find your car.
Come on.
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.
Why are we here?
Come on, let's go.
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.
Gentlemen, we honor the master and the practice by bowing when we enter the dojo.
We're police.
You Edward Mackie?
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.
Are you insane?
Ever see that scene in Indiana jones where he watches some guy with a big sword do his thing and then shoots him?
In this situation, I'm Indy.
Move.
Now.
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--
Move.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Theodore, put thing down before you kill someone.
Hey.
Hey, give me a break.
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?
It's already in the book.
Thanks for everything.
That's why those people are so widely despised.
There's no give and take.
No compromise.
What does any of this have to do with my car?
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.
In prison, he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect, looking for Gil at his father's place.
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names before I do more good deeds.
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning.
He's in jail.
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?
The boy's running so he must have burned somebody.
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.
I seem to recall something about my mother paying you to find my car?
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?
Possibly.
There seems to be a connection between gangs and the list.
Before I was chief assistant, I did head up the gang prosecution unit.
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?
- Really.
- Isn't he about to be executed?
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on, move, move.
- You, too.
- Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.
No, thanks.
You're like a walking cliché.
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.
Brother Blades.
So nice to see you.
Happy, this is my partner, Roberto Clemente.
The sainted ballplayer.
It's my honor.
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott and he ends up locked up.
You know anything about that?
I heard some old guys kicked the shit out him.
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.
Give me six maple, two glazed, and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.
And I'll need the paper back when you're done reading it.
It's like warm maple syrup being poured over your tongue.
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.
Why do they never see that coming?
What a waste of 50 grand.
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.
That one on the list?
Yep.
It's mine.
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.
Yeah.
I'll make sure to use my Club.
That was my guy yesterday, outside the bar.
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.
Why a wool mask in July?
I was hoping to grab Gil before he delivered the paper.
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.
No, the paper wasn't for me.
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily bad reputation, Blades.
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor convicts on the four yard at Angola.
I was one of them.
It was a social club.
I understand you've since diversified considerably.
And like all other complex organizations, we have our internal differences.
The newspaper was a delivery from Willie Van Beber to a pro hitter, identity unknown.
You know who Van Beber is?
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.
He's running out of time.
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?
I believe I do.
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.
I need Gil because he's the one that can ID the person out on the street taking orders from Van Beber.
- Still with me?
- Yeah.
If you hadn't popped Gil, I'd have his contact and it would be over.
I'm genuinely sorry.
I had no idea my nose was in your business.
- Yeah.
These things happen.
- So where's Ed?
Ed's dead.
Or will be shortly.
And you better keep your eye on your little pal Roberto the DA because if he's not on the list, he will be.
You know he's the one that put Willie down.
He's on the list.
Like I said, find Gil.
Get his contact, take him off the street, or feed him to me.
Then, hopefully, Van Beber will go to his great reward and I'll get back to my goddamn doughnuts.
- Blades.
- It's not cars.
It's bodies.
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
I mind.
You're putting my life at risk and those of everyone around you.
Idiot!
Hey, I'm back.
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?
How many non-Whole Foods dinners am I up to?
I'm going to prison soon.
Two of out of the three have federal jackets.
Happy Conners is a snitch?
That's hard to believe.
Negative.
It's Ed Mackie and Dean Nickerson are the informants.
- Which agency?
- FBI.
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy named Willie Van Beber.
Know him?
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.
Very soon.
This is his last hurrah.
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber the names of the informants.
Who has access to the FBI informant database?
Anyone senior in this department or in any other in the region, state or federal.
Why is Gold on the list though?
I'm sure there's more than a few who wanna smoke Gold.
I expect it's because he put Van Beber on death row.
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?
No, we put this out there, our leaky cop evaporates.
True.
Glass finds out I'm working this, he'll have a coronary.
I don't need that.
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?
- Come on!
What are you doing?
- No.
Come on!
Dude!
You coming?
Five-0 in the house.
Was that really necessary?
I keep my love of food and my professional life separate.
- Fatty.
- Blades.
Give me a slab to go with the sauce on the side.
I heard you paid off that jury.
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.
Along with my order, I'll need an address on Gil Ott.
I don't know no Gil.
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.
And I do know me a Bill.
Theodore, assume for a moment most of the people in this place are on parole, probation or otherwise in the system.
How long would it take for me to find out one of them is in possession of a gun resulting in their immediate and protracted incarceration?
You ain't even no police.
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Feel free to call me any time within the next five minutes.
Yeah.
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.
Most importantly, what does any of it have to do with finding my car?
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.
Talk to me.
Thanks, Fatty.
I owe you.
Hey.
You can't just go and do whatever you want in life, Blades.
There are systems and rules.
These systems and rules exist for a reason.
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.
And not once have you just cut a corner, just bent a little.
You know what the United States Supreme Court says?
United States Supreme Court says a prosecutor is a representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy.
No, sir.
As a prosecutor, I am the representative of our sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective my solemn obligation is not to win cases, but to do justice.
I make one wrong move, I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.
It's very tiring to be around you.
You just bought a slab of ribs.
You kidding me?
The last time I ate at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.
This place rocks.
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?
I'm feeling really lost.
Can you try and explain to me what's happening?
Your car look anything like that?
That's it.
I don't believe this.
That's it.
That's my car.
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.
Give me the keys.
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear on how important that car is to my father.
To me.
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
- It's not.
I need to find that car, Blades.
My family is gone, my career is shit, my mother's insane and my father's dying.
The one thing I got half a chance of doing is finding that car.
And if you can't or won't help me, then goddamn it, I will do it myself.
Get off.
Get off.
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.
Hello?
I'm kidnapped.
Here, here.
This is why this country's going in the toilet.
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.
I just saw him.
Called from the trunk of his car after you told me about the list.
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk?
What happened?
A pro, for sure.
You were right about Mackie, he was working for us.
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.
Mackie would have put him down forever.
I was actually figuring Happy for the body.
I don't think so.
Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.
- You know Willie Van Beber?
- 4-4 number-one shot caller?
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.
Van Beber's settling up before he gets executed.
They wanna kill each other, it's fine with me.
Start smoking my informants, I get annoyed.
I mean, Mackie means we lose two ongoing investigations.
He made the list for putting Van Beber on the row.
- How nice.
Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.
After you get your delivery boy, plug the damn leak.
We're not even looking for my car.
I doubt we ever were.
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?
These things take time.
Have faith.
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.
I don't understand.
Why are we waiting?
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we just go in and get Gil Ott now?
Fools rush in, my friend.
I hate golf.
Other than working on the Hawk, this was the one thing my father and I did together.
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs around people's necks.
You just have to relax.
How?
Before you swing, breathe.
Okay, time's up.
I'll go get him.
If Gil Ott's in there, you think my car is nearby?
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
Until about two seconds ago, pretty good.
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?
- Out where?
- Jail.
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead.
Okay?
Paper had the name of 4-4's, two of which were federal snitches.
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
It also had the name of a DA named Theo Gold, who also happens to be a friend.
You get the needle for whacking a DA.
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.
You're the only one who can ID the source which is why I assume you're whacked out in this caddy shack shit hole.
That's just rude.
I live here.
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.
Everybody wants you, Gil.
Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
Sit down.
I need your contact.
One name.
Give me that name and maybe I'll let you live so you can remodel.
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.
Back inside.
Now!
You want me to go after them or get those off you?
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.
Did you ask about the car?
I forgot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Nothing nine Band-Aids and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.
I did predict you'd shoot me.
I remember.
I decided I wanted to live more than I want my car.
My father will understand that.
I'll take you home.
Just drop me off at my parents'.
I'll break the news.
I can already see his face.
God, I'd do anything to avoid that slightly disappointed but not altogether surprised look.
You know the look?
Please.
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old daughter I see one weekend a month.
I know the look.
Theo, go get him before one of the neighbors calls the police.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- What are you doing?
Call you in a bit.
I can't tell whether I'm being guarded or surveilled.
Your little redheaded co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really?
Why?
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on.
That's ridiculous.
She can go to any private firm in this city and make five times what she's making.
She doesn't need to sell informant data for money, okay?
- You want me to call her?
Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore.
Maybe later.
My mother wants you to come in for my belated birthday dinner.
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?
Can you do the entire Valoise family a favor and just stay off the subject?
Please?
Did you know that Robert Evans was our neighbor for a while in California?
Of course, that was before he became huge.
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.
Apparently not so incredible that he cast me in anything.
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.
Sonny and Cher.
Bobby Redford.
Bobby had a terrible overbite.
Tell me again.
Who are you?
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.
That is very interesting.
Your son's a great lawyer.
We would have preferred if he had gone into dentistry but you give them wings, they fly away.
You know how it is, Marty.
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.
That was before anyone told me about his, you know, style.
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it?
Thank you.
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.
I used to think I had one.
Now I realize I burned it down without even knowing.
Homes get rebuilt.
All I wanted was to spend whatever time my dad has left driving around with him in the Hawk.
- Pulling plugs.
You know?
- And sending me to prison.
I figured this is the time to be a good son.
After, I'd try to be a better husband and father.
Tell me about your daughter.
She lives with her mom.
All the money I skimmed from the detective busts went toward her school.
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.
I feel horrible about it.
You expect me to drop the case because you have the same problems that everybody else does.
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.
People get divorced and pay for braces all the time...
- ...without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.
They lack opportunity.
Maybe.
I mean, my wife's family has money.
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.
You still can't tell me what we've been doing for the past day?
For the moment, no.
And the car is safely on its way to Argentina.
Bon voyage, old friend.
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.
Tomorrow, Again, again and again and again.
- It's a great movie.
- Yeah.
She's not your mother.
What's that about your mother?
Theo was just telling me that Lena's not my mother.
You didn't know that?
I told you, detective, my father dropped me off at the hotel.
I was alone.
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.
- I can't help it.
- Try.
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.
He was there with you.
He used three capital letters to sign for the drink.
WMP.
William McPherson.
Why do you hate me?
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.
That scene kills me every time.
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.
- WVB?
- Yeah.
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.
Makes sense, but we figured it came from him.
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl and she says Gil snitched for her in a possession case last year.
So she felt like she owed him a favor.
Gil gave her some story about the hold being trumped up.
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.
Check and see if Van Beber has any kids.
Nick, what the heck are you doing in there?
- I gotta go.
Just check.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?
You say you'll bring it back and I nod like a robot?
I'll take him.
Just let me get this.
Yo.
Detective Blades?
It's Rosalyn Wohl.
- Yes?
- Who is that?
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?
He says he'll give you the guy who's killing the people on the list.
All right.
Where?
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.
Just do what he says.
- What does Gil want?
- The list.
- Why?
- If he gets the list back his employer refrains from putting a bullet in his ear.
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.
You don't have the list.
Happy took it.
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?
You know all those bad people you sent to prison?
They ever call to say thanks?
No.
Sometimes I send people to prison for doing bad things.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people.
I appreciate that.
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?
Apparently his last wish is for you to precede him to the promised land.
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo.
Too dangerous.
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car.
Don't give me a gun.
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.
- You trust me?
- I trust you.
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.
- Yeah.
- Happy.
Blades.
If you're not too busy making doughnuts I could use some backup.
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?
Well, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?
- Gold, yes.
Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.
Let's go.
Now.
Come on.
You're staying with me.
Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
- Wonderful.
Hands on your head.
Hands.
Come on.
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?
I don't know.
Am I supposed to know?
Oh, shit.
Call 911 and stay with the car.
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.
I ran into your father, Gil.
- He's worried about you.
- My father?
That's funny.
That's really-- That's hilarious.
- Where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.
Bullshit.
Give me the goddamn paper.
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.
And you don't really need it anyway.
Hands up on your head.
I'm really sorry about the way this ends, detective.
I had such a good time watching you in trial.
You were the happiest defendant I've ever seen.
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.
You know you were right.
About the list?
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.
You're not the first to say so, although you may be the last.
Thought that kidnapping thing sounded fishy.
I knew you'd respond to a lady in distress.
That's no way to treat an employee.
Independent contractor.
I thought I was doing you a favor though, killing Gold.
He wants to put you away.
Once you know him, his intentions are good.
That's very magnanimous.
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.
So, yeah, sad story all around.
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.
Police!
A few of my dad's friends.
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.
Oh, shit.
Blades.
You could have put my father away for life.
Instead you had to kill him?
- I'm sorry.
I was just doing my job.
- No compromises.
No deals.
Right?
Well, guess what.
No deal for you either.
Don't move.
Yeah, well, Wohl was her mother's maiden name.
Van Beber never married her.
I hate to admit it, Blades, but you're not a half-bad detective.
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath the next 85 years.
Are we still on for Whole Foods?
You bet.
Want a ride to work in the morning?
Sure.
How very gallant of you.
Thanks.
- It's tomorrow.
- Again.
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.
That is good.
- That's bad.
- That is bad.
Still going after my dad for adultery?
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.
It's a fantasy.
He never cheated on her.
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God.
More fantasy.
Does my mother have any actual evidence of this affair?
Her theory is that he takes his girl or girls to this hotel.
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I found the car.
If the Hawk was supposed to be on its way to Argentina why did it keep popping up over town?
Excellent question.
You wouldn't expect a thief to steal it then tool around.
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.
Except when driving the Hawk.
He would never take a mistress to a swank hotel.
He would park the car in a hotel garage if it meant keeping it off the street.
Yes!
What do you say?
I get a turn at the wheel of this beauty?
All right, you've earned it.
You just go very easy, okay?
She likes to be rewed a lot before she downshifts.
- Taser boy?
- Yes?
Relax.
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.
You have to convince 12 jurors, including at least a few females.
Yes.
Yes.
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?
Letting you drive!
Apologize to your father for me.
Dad, I am really, really sorry.
Is he dead?
He never stood a chance against the Hawk.
Who is he?
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.
I guess killing his daughter didn't endear us to him.
We got lucky.
I've never been lucky.
Thanks.
For what?
Keeping me alive.
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.
So speaking of you sending me to prison....
We were?
Admittedly, I've had some lapses of judgment.
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses here and there.
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.
Thanks for showing me the forest and the grays.
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?
What am I gonna tell my dad?
Tell him how much you love him.
The rest is pretty much paint by numbers.
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.
Son.
Hey.
Dad.
What time is it?
I have some bad news.
What?
Where's mom?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay.
Mom is fine.
She's fine.
Now, look, Theo.
I don't want you to overreact or anything but it appears as if the Hawk has been stolen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.
Me?
That car meant everything in the world to you.
Everything?
No, no, no.
It's a fine automobile but you know what I always say:
It's just a car.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.
We interviewed a few jurors after the mistrial they seemed pretty unimpressed, so we walked away.
But the fact that you decided to dismiss the case doesn't mean Detective Blades is innocent.
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.
I understand you spent time with Detective Blades looking for your car, which you reported stolen?
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.
Looks like you and Detective Blades had quite an adventure.
Detective Blades was instrumental in uncovering a damaging leak that was in our office.
A leak which had already resulted in the death of an FBI informant.
That's very impressive.
Look you knew at the time that Detective Blades was on administrative leave and he had specific orders not to do any police work.
My mother hired him as a Pl to look for the car.
Which your father had.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
I bet Detective Blades went out of his way not to mislead anyone about his status.
He never flipped his badge, right?
Never brandished his gun?
Never once in your presence identified himself as a police officer?
Technically, no.
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
My head.
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil.
How you been?
Move.
Move.
I said move.
First of all, A, I'm a cop.
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.
Doesn't it get itchy?
Sweaty?
The paper.
Even though your face is covered, I can tell, you need a hug.
- Back off.
- Come on.
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.
No love?
Really?
You coming?
- What did I do?
- How should I know?
You gonna pick that up?
Hurry, I gotta go to court.
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come on, man.
You can't lock me up for walking down the street.
Guy with the persuader pointed at my head?
I don't know that guy.
- What's in the paper?
- News.
Newspaper.
Wallet.
And the gun.
Okay, easy tiger.
What's with the paper?
This is a really unsatisfying conversation.
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?
Better than you.
He took my money.
And when you tell me what I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.
Off to dance with Lady Justice.
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.
I've always been lucky.
Hey.
What the hell?
Firearm.
Thank you, sir.
You're Lena Valoise.
I was.
Tomorrow, Again is one of my favorite movies.
Me too.
- Nick.
- How do you do?
Great.
What are you doing here?
I've come to see my son, the assistant DA.
Me too.
- You must be very proud.
- I must.
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.
- You look a little lost.
- I am.
Courtroom 3?
Come.
I'll show you.
We call it the thin blue line, the police.
The fragile barrier between the bad guys and you.
We give policemen like Detective Nick Blades guns.
We pay them well.
And all we ask in return is that they do what they swear they'll do.
Protect and serve.
But what happens if they break that promise?
What happens if one day you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys?
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold care to join us in this case?
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.
Anarchy.
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.
- Mr. Gold....
- You know what?
I still do.
I believe there is such a thing as right and wrong.
I believe in an irrepressible commitment to the truth.
An irreproachable moral and ethical code that cannot be compromised.
Detective Blades thought he could be the law, but not follow it.
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.
That's wrong.
Thank you.
We will adjourn for the day.
First time he called the police on me he was 9.
- What'd you do?
- I took away his legos.
Mr. Gold.
Your reaction to the DA's decision to retire?
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.
Do you have any comments on a frontrunner for the interim slot?
I've been dealing with police corruption.
It doesn't leave a lot of time to deal with office personnel matters.
Do you plan on attending Willie Van Beber's execution?
I did my job putting Willie Van Beber right where he belongs.
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner take it from there.
Excuse me.
You people don't mind if I borrow my son, the assistant DA, do you?
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.
You sure you don't have an announcement to make?
Your father is having an affair.
Would you and the good Lord care to comment on that?
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?
Every time you say Dad's having sex with someone else.
Go to the country house.
Where's the van?
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.
I thought we'd agree we only use the Hawk in an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1 :30.
Honey, this car represents the last fragile thread of dignity holding my family together.
Take my car.
Park in my spot.
Theo.
I thought on people's birthdays, other people are supposed to do what they want.
And I thought turning 40 meant not acting 7.
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch with the next DA.
Great.
And you'll still earn less than our gardener and I'll still be paying for lunch with my parents' credit card.
Jeez, Kelly, come on.
Don't do this.
Just give me today.
You're the one who wants to live in a house big enough for 12.
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.
I'm leaving.
I'm not done yet.
Leaving you.
Actually, you're the one leaving since my parents own the house.
I'll give you one week to get your things and get out.
Today you do this?
Today?
On my birthday?
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years I've wasted on someone going precisely nowhere?
Kelly, come on.
Wait a minute.
What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.
Really?
And how many hours do you spend with them on any given week?
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you three times what the DA's job pays.
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.
I believe in what I do.
Is that so wrong?
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?
Yeah?
Okay.
They want me back.
- Right away, sir.
- Good.
Because I don't.
I'm sorry.
Please remember to put the cover back on the Hawk.
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.
I've received the following note from the jurors.
"We have voted several times.
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.
Would you like to set the matter for retrial?
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
Blades?
I don't care what the jury did.
You're on leave until you deal with Internal Affairs.
Do you hear me?
Until I say so, you are not police.
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA, they're gonna rush out and get my name tattooed across their butt cheeks.
- Give me five.
- Nice going.
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?
Was in Interview 4, but Schaefer needed the room so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate?
I'm buying.
You're buying?
Or is Gil buying?
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.
He was carrying the paper the cash when I popped him.
Then some ape in a wool ski mask came at me with a piece.
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?
There's numbers and letters circled all over it.
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.
I tried to decipher it but Gold's closing was distracting.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
I'll go sit on Gil.
Blades strikes me as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.
He's dirty.
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.
Yes, exactly.
We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.
I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.
Trust cops to deal with cops?
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.
Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?
Turns out, it's mostly grays.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.
Am I supposed to see the forest or mostly grays?
Look, everything I know comes from you.
A much younger and stupider me.
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.
Good.
Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.
You're kidding?
Grant Stone?
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.
And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.
So do the judges.
Most of the defense bar.
I should start caring about defense lawyers?
Everybody in the system gets chewed up, Theo.
Including the poor bastards we send to prison.
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--
Theo.
Take some time off.
Go home.
Look in the mirror.
I need Gil Ott for an interview.
- Not here.
- Where is he?
Check again.
Detective Schaefer brought him earlier.
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want?
I just came on.
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.
What the crap?
Come on.
What's up with the sneak attack?
License, registration, proof of insurance.
I'm a DA.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
License.
My registration.
Have you had anything to drink tonight, Mr. Gould, is it?
It's Gold.
Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.
Mr. Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.
If you do not calm down, I will have to place you under arrest.
Are you joking?
What is all this about?
- Please step out of the car.
- No.
Mr. Gold, please step out of the vehicle now.
I am placing you under arrest.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.
- No, I'm not.
- You are definitely resisting arrest.
What are you talking about?
If you continue to resist arrest, I will Tase you.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.
Make the call.
Let's go 10-99.
Detective Nick Blades there's something shocking you should see, State and Chestnut.
Get the hell away from me.
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.
Just leave me alone.
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.
I've seen Tomorrow, Again like 50 times.
Please don't speak to me.
What happened?
Two policemen kidnapped and Tased me.
Friends of yours, I presume.
I've never been Tased myself.
Imagine the worst dental appointment of all time.
You got lucky, detective.
It won't happen again.
I've always been lucky.
Today's my birthday.
I hope it's the best one ever.
Kelly!
No, no.
Don't do this to me.
Kelly.
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead apparently, your precious Hawk is missing and you may remember, I'm going to my parents until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.
Just give me a little more time to explain to the kids.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys.
Daddy loves you.
See you soon.
This asshole must be having the worst day of his life.
He just called in to report that someone stole his car out of his driveway.
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?
You know what happens when you wake up in the morning and you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad?
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.
Anarchy.
And the Cubs win the World Series.
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.
We've done our share of fooling around over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.
It's time for him to hang up his sword and die with something approaching dignity.
Mom, I don't need to hear this.
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.
I thought it was the cancer, so I didn't push.
But now I know.
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.
What time are you picking us up for lunch?
Theo?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.
- So take the van.
- It's dead.
Again?
All right, you have my permission to use the Hawk, just be very careful.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What's wrong with the Hawk?
I don't believe this.
I gotta go.
If something happens to that automobile, it'll kill your father.
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.
Move out of the street.
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.
Please move out of the street or I'll have to cite you.
I'm bleeding here.
I'm bleeding here.
Move now.
My car was stolen.
I saw the guy driving it around the corner two minutes ago.
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh?
Shocking.
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.
I don't see anything.
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.
You know, I'm about to go off shift if you want a ride downtown.
Thank you.
Okay, Blades, so now you're buying two dinners.
And not the Whole Foods deli again, either.
Someplace where they bring food to the table.
Let's see what you got, then we'll decide.
Well, it was code.
Forensics figures it for driver's license numbers.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep.
And it's four local Louisiana plates.
It's just that there are three extra letters.
WVB or BVW, depending on how you read it.
But one of the cars is registered to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.
If we have the list and Gil's in jail, how does the car get stolen?
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.
Check with Schaefer and Chin.
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses on my way to Gil's.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
Blades.
Goddamn it.
If you're out there impersonating a police officer, I will pinch you myself.
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.
In the meantime, I'm having my teeth cleaned and maybe a trim.
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.
So as soon as we can unplug an officer from another matter, we'll be with you.
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor and tell him to come out here now.
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
I understand that my reputation precedes me.
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour my car was stolen, and I just want a little help.
That's all.
Despite the fact you've been trying to put one of my best cops in jail I find this conversation scintillating.
You, in fact, may describe it as electrifying.
- How you doing?
- Good.
I'm detective Nick Blades, New Orleans police.
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.
- Your parents home?
- No.
- They at work?
- No.
- I give up.
Where are they?
- Dead.
My grandma says that if she was on the jury she'd vote to send you to jail.
I guess I'm glad your grandma's not on the jury.
My grandma says you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am.
Your grandma take care of you?
- Yeah.
- Is she home?
No.
Is that your grandma's car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?
- Yeah.
- Is he home?
- No.
- Where's he?
- Jail.
Does he get out soon?
My grandma said it depends if his jury is as dumb as yours.
Tell your grandma to lock the car up tight.
All right.
- Hand over the money already.
- It's not like it's because you got nothing.
Yeah, well.
It's okay, guys.
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot?
He just said that.
Never heard of you.
Let's see it.
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.
Enjoy.
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know.
Ask him.
What you want with Gil?
Where is the little creep?
After he robbed 400 off me, he didn't leave no forwarding address.
- You see him with this guy?
- No.
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?
All I know is, last time I saw him, he was okay.
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.
I chose Olive Garden.
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?
Thank you.
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.
I also took that off Gil.
Call 911.
Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.
I'm sure they'll find it.
But with my luck, somebody will probably have peed in it.
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.
Well, also in the meantime my wife is taking away my kids, my car was stolen and because of Blades, I'm getting no help from the cops.
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.
I should have listened.
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.
That's much better than rotting teeth.
You mentioned the Van Beber case.
Here's the murder book.
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.
And everyone was mad at me for not dealing.
The judge was mad at me for ruining his summer vacation.
The boss didn't want me tied up for three months.
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.
Plead it.
Settle it.
Compromise.
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.
Grab that, will you?
- Hello?
- Kelly you get your husband on the phone right now.
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger about our problems like it's CNN.
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly he insisted we come to your house.
When you weren't here, he got very upset and locked himself...
- ...in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?
Apparently.
He must've had it in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears...
- ...
like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.
You can buy guns in vending machines now.
- Call the cops.
- No.
I will not have some SWAT team blasting through the door scaring your father to death.
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I gotta go.
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.
Where'd you get those tickets?
Kinko's?
Nice pants.
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?
He's been threatening to kill himself for the last 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.
Herb, I want the truth.
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.
Along with everything else, he's cheating.
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?
Herb.
What did you do?
- Wait.
- Marty.
Holy moly.
Put down the gun.
- Oh, Lord.
Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.
He's not well, Nick.
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky.
He won't shoot Marty.
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.
You need a haircut.
I said I'd stay with him in sickness and in health.
Now he's sick and I'm staying.
But I can't abide the cheating.
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.
Just follow him.
I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?
I heard about your son's car being stolen, thought I could help.
What car?
- Oh, my God.
The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.
Detective Blades happened to stop by and everything's under control.
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.
He's agreed to help find the car.
And the other matter?
Forget the other matter for the moment.
You and Theo find the Hawk.
I'll do everything I can to keep this from your father.
I'll expect regular reports.
- She wants reports.
- I heard.
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.
This is a very comfortable mattress.
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.
Kelly bought it.
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?
Same reason everybody buys one.
It's a crazy world out there, son.
And I got like 30 percent off.
Don't you tell your mother.
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.
Am I dreaming this or is your Uncle Marty here?
Uncle Marty?
Of course, he had to leave.
Took my gun.
I think that's probably for the best.
Theo, your mother has to try this mattress.
I mean, it is incredible.
You should try it.
Come on.
Try it.
Come on.
Yeah.
So?
It is.
It's a great mattress.
It is sublime is what it is.
Yeah.
It's nice.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck.
Monday, on a ship.
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.
Trust me, you're not getting any play from the department.
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.
You get your way, I'm gonna need all the money I can scrape together.
I'm not dropping the charges, even if you do find the car.
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.
- You know him?
- How would I know him?
Gil was carrying a newspaper with plates numbers written in code on it.
Your plate number was on the list.
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye on the Hawk.
It's a very nice car.
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.
I wasted every weekend of my childhood working on that damn car.
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.
I get it.
So, what do we do?
We go see Ott, you slap him around a little he tells us where my car is?
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court, so I had to park him.
While you were blasting me in front of the jury, he slipped.
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.
But I'll assume that he delivered a copy of the list once he got out.
So how do we find my car?
How should I know?
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.
Although, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.
Don't do that.
What--?
What--?
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?
I'm a lawyer.
My mind is my weapon.
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me long before I find your car.
Come on.
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.
Why are we here?
Come on, let's go.
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.
Gentlemen, we honor the master and the practice by bowing when we enter the dojo.
We're police.
You Edward Mackie?
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.
Are you insane?
Ever see that scene in Indiana jones where he watches some guy with a big sword do his thing and then shoots him?
In this situation, I'm Indy.
Move.
Now.
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--
Move.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Theodore, put thing down before you kill someone.
Hey.
Hey, give me a break.
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?
It's already in the book.
Thanks for everything.
That's why those people are so widely despised.
There's no give and take.
No compromise.
What does any of this have to do with my car?
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.
In prison, he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect, looking for Gil at his father's place.
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names before I do more good deeds.
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning.
He's in jail.
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?
The boy's running so he must have burned somebody.
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.
I seem to recall something about my mother paying you to find my car?
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?
Possibly.
There seems to be a connection between gangs and the list.
Before I was chief assistant, I did head up the gang prosecution unit.
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?
- Really.
- Isn't he about to be executed?
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on, move, move.
- You, too.
- Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.
No, thanks.
You're like a walking cliché.
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.
Brother Blades.
So nice to see you.
Happy, this is my partner, Roberto Clemente.
The sainted ballplayer.
It's my honor.
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott and he ends up locked up.
You know anything about that?
I heard some old guys kicked the shit out him.
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.
Give me six maple, two glazed, and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.
And I'll need the paper back when you're done reading it.
It's like warm maple syrup being poured over your tongue.
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.
Why do they never see that coming?
What a waste of 50 grand.
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.
That one on the list?
Yep.
It's mine.
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.
Yeah.
I'll make sure to use my Club.
That was my guy yesterday, outside the bar.
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.
Why a wool mask in July?
I was hoping to grab Gil before he delivered the paper.
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.
No, the paper wasn't for me.
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily bad reputation, Blades.
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor convicts on the four yard at Angola.
I was one of them.
It was a social club.
I understand you've since diversified considerably.
And like all other complex organizations, we have our internal differences.
The newspaper was a delivery from Willie Van Beber to a pro hitter, identity unknown.
You know who Van Beber is?
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.
He's running out of time.
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?
I believe I do.
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.
I need Gil because he's the one that can ID the person out on the street taking orders from Van Beber.
- Still with me?
- Yeah.
If you hadn't popped Gil, I'd have his contact and it would be over.
I'm genuinely sorry.
I had no idea my nose was in your business.
- Yeah.
These things happen.
- So where's Ed?
Ed's dead.
Or will be shortly.
And you better keep your eye on your little pal Roberto the DA because if he's not on the list, he will be.
You know he's the one that put Willie down.
He's on the list.
Like I said, find Gil.
Get his contact, take him off the street, or feed him to me.
Then, hopefully, Van Beber will go to his great reward and I'll get back to my goddamn doughnuts.
- Blades.
- It's not cars.
It's bodies.
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
I mind.
You're putting my life at risk and those of everyone around you.
Idiot!
Hey, I'm back.
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?
How many non-Whole Foods dinners am I up to?
I'm going to prison soon.
Two of out of the three have federal jackets.
Happy Conners is a snitch?
That's hard to believe.
Negative.
It's Ed Mackie and Dean Nickerson are the informants.
- Which agency?
- FBI.
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy named Willie Van Beber.
Know him?
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.
Very soon.
This is his last hurrah.
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber the names of the informants.
Who has access to the FBI informant database?
Anyone senior in this department or in any other in the region, state or federal.
Why is Gold on the list though?
I'm sure there's more than a few who wanna smoke Gold.
I expect it's because he put Van Beber on death row.
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?
No, we put this out there, our leaky cop evaporates.
True.
Glass finds out I'm working this, he'll have a coronary.
I don't need that.
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?
- Come on!
What are you doing?
- No.
Come on!
Dude!
You coming?
Five-0 in the house.
Was that really necessary?
I keep my love of food and my professional life separate.
- Fatty.
- Blades.
Give me a slab to go with the sauce on the side.
I heard you paid off that jury.
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.
Along with my order, I'll need an address on Gil Ott.
I don't know no Gil.
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.
And I do know me a Bill.
Theodore, assume for a moment most of the people in this place are on parole, probation or otherwise in the system.
How long would it take for me to find out one of them is in possession of a gun resulting in their immediate and protracted incarceration?
You ain't even no police.
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Feel free to call me any time within the next five minutes.
Yeah.
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.
Most importantly, what does any of it have to do with finding my car?
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.
Talk to me.
Thanks, Fatty.
I owe you.
Hey.
You can't just go and do whatever you want in life, Blades.
There are systems and rules.
These systems and rules exist for a reason.
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.
And not once have you just cut a corner, just bent a little.
You know what the United States Supreme Court says?
United States Supreme Court says a prosecutor is a representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy.
No, sir.
As a prosecutor, I am the representative of our sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective my solemn obligation is not to win cases, but to do justice.
I make one wrong move, I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.
It's very tiring to be around you.
You just bought a slab of ribs.
You kidding me?
The last time I ate at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.
This place rocks.
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?
I'm feeling really lost.
Can you try and explain to me what's happening?
Your car look anything like that?
That's it.
I don't believe this.
That's it.
That's my car.
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.
Give me the keys.
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear on how important that car is to my father.
To me.
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
- It's not.
I need to find that car, Blades.
My family is gone, my career is shit, my mother's insane and my father's dying.
The one thing I got half a chance of doing is finding that car.
And if you can't or won't help me, then goddamn it, I will do it myself.
Get off.
Get off.
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.
Hello?
I'm kidnapped.
Here, here.
This is why this country's going in the toilet.
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.
I just saw him.
Called from the trunk of his car after you told me about the list.
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk?
What happened?
A pro, for sure.
You were right about Mackie, he was working for us.
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.
Mackie would have put him down forever.
I was actually figuring Happy for the body.
I don't think so.
Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.
- You know Willie Van Beber?
- 4-4 number-one shot caller?
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.
Van Beber's settling up before he gets executed.
They wanna kill each other, it's fine with me.
Start smoking my informants, I get annoyed.
I mean, Mackie means we lose two ongoing investigations.
He made the list for putting Van Beber on the row.
- How nice.
Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.
After you get your delivery boy, plug the damn leak.
We're not even looking for my car.
I doubt we ever were.
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?
These things take time.
Have faith.
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.
I don't understand.
Why are we waiting?
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we just go in and get Gil Ott now?
Fools rush in, my friend.
I hate golf.
Other than working on the Hawk, this was the one thing my father and I did together.
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs around people's necks.
You just have to relax.
How?
Before you swing, breathe.
Okay, time's up.
I'll go get him.
If Gil Ott's in there, you think my car is nearby?
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
Until about two seconds ago, pretty good.
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?
- Out where?
- Jail.
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead.
Okay?
Paper had the name of 4-4's, two of which were federal snitches.
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
It also had the name of a DA named Theo Gold, who also happens to be a friend.
You get the needle for whacking a DA.
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.
You're the only one who can ID the source which is why I assume you're whacked out in this caddy shack shit hole.
That's just rude.
I live here.
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.
Everybody wants you, Gil.
Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
Sit down.
I need your contact.
One name.
Give me that name and maybe I'll let you live so you can remodel.
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.
Back inside.
Now!
You want me to go after them or get those off you?
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.
Did you ask about the car?
I forgot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Nothing nine Band-Aids and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.
I did predict you'd shoot me.
I remember.
I decided I wanted to live more than I want my car.
My father will understand that.
I'll take you home.
Just drop me off at my parents'.
I'll break the news.
I can already see his face.
God, I'd do anything to avoid that slightly disappointed but not altogether surprised look.
You know the look?
Please.
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old daughter I see one weekend a month.
I know the look.
Theo, go get him before one of the neighbors calls the police.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- What are you doing?
Call you in a bit.
I can't tell whether I'm being guarded or surveilled.
Your little redheaded co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really?
Why?
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on.
That's ridiculous.
She can go to any private firm in this city and make five times what she's making.
She doesn't need to sell informant data for money, okay?
- You want me to call her?
Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore.
Maybe later.
My mother wants you to come in for my belated birthday dinner.
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?
Can you do the entire Valoise family a favor and just stay off the subject?
Please?
Did you know that Robert Evans was our neighbor for a while in California?
Of course, that was before he became huge.
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.
Apparently not so incredible that he cast me in anything.
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.
Sonny and Cher.
Bobby Redford.
Bobby had a terrible overbite.
Tell me again.
Who are you?
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.
That is very interesting.
Your son's a great lawyer.
We would have preferred if he had gone into dentistry but you give them wings, they fly away.
You know how it is, Marty.
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.
That was before anyone told me about his, you know, style.
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it?
Thank you.
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.
I used to think I had one.
Now I realize I burned it down without even knowing.
Homes get rebuilt.
All I wanted was to spend whatever time my dad has left driving around with him in the Hawk.
- Pulling plugs.
You know?
- And sending me to prison.
I figured this is the time to be a good son.
After, I'd try to be a better husband and father.
Tell me about your daughter.
She lives with her mom.
All the money I skimmed from the detective busts went toward her school.
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.
I feel horrible about it.
You expect me to drop the case because you have the same problems that everybody else does.
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.
People get divorced and pay for braces all the time...
- ...without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.
They lack opportunity.
Maybe.
I mean, my wife's family has money.
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.
You still can't tell me what we've been doing for the past day?
For the moment, no.
And the car is safely on its way to Argentina.
Bon voyage, old friend.
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.
Tomorrow, Again, again and again and again.
- It's a great movie.
- Yeah.
She's not your mother.
What's that about your mother?
Theo was just telling me that Lena's not my mother.
You didn't know that?
I told you, detective, my father dropped me off at the hotel.
I was alone.
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.
- I can't help it.
- Try.
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.
He was there with you.
He used three capital letters to sign for the drink.
WMP.
William McPherson.
Why do you hate me?
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.
That scene kills me every time.
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.
- WVB?
- Yeah.
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.
Makes sense, but we figured it came from him.
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl and she says Gil snitched for her in a possession case last year.
So she felt like she owed him a favor.
Gil gave her some story about the hold being trumped up.
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.
Check and see if Van Beber has any kids.
Nick, what the heck are you doing in there?
- I gotta go.
Just check.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?
You say you'll bring it back and I nod like a robot?
I'll take him.
Just let me get this.
Yo.
Detective Blades?
It's Rosalyn Wohl.
- Yes?
- Who is that?
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?
He says he'll give you the guy who's killing the people on the list.
All right.
Where?
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.
Just do what he says.
- What does Gil want?
- The list.
- Why?
- If he gets the list back his employer refrains from putting a bullet in his ear.
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.
You don't have the list.
Happy took it.
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?
You know all those bad people you sent to prison?
They ever call to say thanks?
No.
Sometimes I send people to prison for doing bad things.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people.
I appreciate that.
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?
Apparently his last wish is for you to precede him to the promised land.
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo.
Too dangerous.
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car.
Don't give me a gun.
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.
- You trust me?
- I trust you.
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.
- Yeah.
- Happy.
Blades.
If you're not too busy making doughnuts I could use some backup.
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?
Well, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?
- Gold, yes.
Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.
Let's go.
Now.
Come on.
You're staying with me.
Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
- Wonderful.
Hands on your head.
Hands.
Come on.
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?
I don't know.
Am I supposed to know?
Oh, shit.
Call 911 and stay with the car.
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.
I ran into your father, Gil.
- He's worried about you.
- My father?
That's funny.
That's really-- That's hilarious.
- Where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.
Bullshit.
Give me the goddamn paper.
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.
And you don't really need it anyway.
Hands up on your head.
I'm really sorry about the way this ends, detective.
I had such a good time watching you in trial.
You were the happiest defendant I've ever seen.
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.
You know you were right.
About the list?
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.
You're not the first to say so, although you may be the last.
Thought that kidnapping thing sounded fishy.
I knew you'd respond to a lady in distress.
That's no way to treat an employee.
Independent contractor.
I thought I was doing you a favor though, killing Gold.
He wants to put you away.
Once you know him, his intentions are good.
That's very magnanimous.
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.
So, yeah, sad story all around.
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.
Police!
A few of my dad's friends.
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.
Oh, shit.
Blades.
You could have put my father away for life.
Instead you had to kill him?
- I'm sorry.
I was just doing my job.
- No compromises.
No deals.
Right?
Well, guess what.
No deal for you either.
Don't move.
Yeah, well, Wohl was her mother's maiden name.
Van Beber never married her.
I hate to admit it, Blades, but you're not a half-bad detective.
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath the next 85 years.
Are we still on for Whole Foods?
You bet.
Want a ride to work in the morning?
Sure.
How very gallant of you.
Thanks.
- It's tomorrow.
- Again.
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.
That is good.
- That's bad.
- That is bad.
Still going after my dad for adultery?
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.
It's a fantasy.
He never cheated on her.
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God.
More fantasy.
Does my mother have any actual evidence of this affair?
Her theory is that he takes his girl or girls to this hotel.
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I found the car.
If the Hawk was supposed to be on its way to Argentina why did it keep popping up over town?
Excellent question.
You wouldn't expect a thief to steal it then tool around.
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.
Except when driving the Hawk.
He would never take a mistress to a swank hotel.
He would park the car in a hotel garage if it meant keeping it off the street.
Yes!
What do you say?
I get a turn at the wheel of this beauty?
All right, you've earned it.
You just go very easy, okay?
She likes to be rewed a lot before she downshifts.
- Taser boy?
- Yes?
Relax.
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.
You have to convince 12 jurors, including at least a few females.
Yes.
Yes.
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?
Letting you drive!
Apologize to your father for me.
Dad, I am really, really sorry.
Is he dead?
He never stood a chance against the Hawk.
Who is he?
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.
I guess killing his daughter didn't endear us to him.
We got lucky.
I've never been lucky.
Thanks.
For what?
Keeping me alive.
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.
So speaking of you sending me to prison....
We were?
Admittedly, I've had some lapses of judgment.
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses here and there.
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.
Thanks for showing me the forest and the grays.
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?
What am I gonna tell my dad?
Tell him how much you love him.
The rest is pretty much paint by numbers.
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.
Son.
Hey.
Dad.
What time is it?
I have some bad news.
What?
Where's mom?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay.
Mom is fine.
She's fine.
Now, look, Theo.
I don't want you to overreact or anything but it appears as if the Hawk has been stolen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.
Me?
That car meant everything in the world to you.
Everything?
No, no, no.
It's a fine automobile but you know what I always say:
It's just a car.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.
We interviewed a few jurors after the mistrial they seemed pretty unimpressed, so we walked away.
But the fact that you decided to dismiss the case doesn't mean Detective Blades is innocent.
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.
I understand you spent time with Detective Blades looking for your car, which you reported stolen?
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.
Looks like you and Detective Blades had quite an adventure.
Detective Blades was instrumental in uncovering a damaging leak that was in our office.
A leak which had already resulted in the death of an FBI informant.
That's very impressive.
Look you knew at the time that Detective Blades was on administrative leave and he had specific orders not to do any police work.
My mother hired him as a Pl to look for the car.
Which your father had.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
I bet Detective Blades went out of his way not to mislead anyone about his status.
He never flipped his badge, right?
Never brandished his gun?
Never once in your presence identified himself as a police officer?
Technically, no.
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
Subtitle By Transporter
My head.
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil.
How you been?
Move.
Move.
I said move.
First of all, A, I'm a cop.
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.
Doesn't it get itchy?
Sweaty?
The paper.
Even though your face is covered, I can tell, you need a hug.
- Back off.
- Come on.
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.
No love?
Really?
You coming?
- What did I do?
- How should I know?
You gonna pick that up?
Hurry, I gotta go to court.
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come on, man.
You can't lock me up for walking down the street.
Guy with the persuader pointed at my head?
I don't know that guy.
- What's in the paper?
- News.
Newspaper.
Wallet.
And the gun.
Okay, easy tiger.
What's with the paper?
This is a really unsatisfying conversation.
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?
Better than you.
He took my money.
And when you tell me what I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.
Off to dance with Lady Justice.
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.
I've always been lucky.
Hey.
What the hell?
Firearm.
Thank you, sir.
You're Lena Valoise.
I was.
Tomorrow, Again is one of my favorite movies.
Me too.
- Nick.
- How do you do?
Great.
What are you doing here?
I've come to see my son, the assistant DA.
Me too.
- You must be very proud.
- I must.
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.
- You look a little lost.
- I am.
Courtroom 3?
Come.
I'll show you.
We call it the thin blue line, the police.
The fragile barrier between the bad guys and you.
We give policemen like Detective Nick Blades guns.
We pay them well.
And all we ask in return is that they do what they swear they'll do.
Protect and serve.
But what happens if they break that promise?
What happens if one day you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys?
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold care to join us in this case?
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.
Anarchy.
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.
- Mr. Gold....
- You know what?
I still do.
I believe there is such a thing as right and wrong.
I believe in an irrepressible commitment to the truth.
An irreproachable moral and ethical code that cannot be compromised.
Detective Blades thought he could be the law, but not follow it.
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.
That's wrong.
Thank you.
We will adjourn for the day.
First time he called the police on me he was 9.
- What'd you do?
- I took away his legos.
Mr. Gold.
Your reaction to the DA's decision to retire?
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.
Do you have any comments on a frontrunner for the interim slot?
I've been dealing with police corruption.
It doesn't leave a lot of time to deal with office personnel matters.
Do you plan on attending Willie Van Beber's execution?
I did my job putting Willie Van Beber right where he belongs.
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner take it from there.
Excuse me.
You people don't mind if I borrow my son, the assistant DA, do you?
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.
You sure you don't have an announcement to make?
Your father is having an affair.
Would you and the good Lord care to comment on that?
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?
Every time you say Dad's having sex with someone else.
Go to the country house.
Where's the van?
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.
I thought we'd agree we only use the Hawk in an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1 :30.
Honey, this car represents the last fragile thread of dignity holding my family together.
Take my car.
Park in my spot.
Theo.
I thought on people's birthdays, other people are supposed to do what they want.
And I thought turning 40 meant not acting 7.
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch with the next DA.
Great.
And you'll still earn less than our gardener and I'll still be paying for lunch with my parents' credit card.
Jeez, Kelly, come on.
Don't do this.
Just give me today.
You're the one who wants to live in a house big enough for 12.
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.
I'm leaving.
I'm not done yet.
Leaving you.
Actually, you're the one leaving since my parents own the house.
I'll give you one week to get your things and get out.
Today you do this?
Today?
On my birthday?
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years I've wasted on someone going precisely nowhere?
Kelly, come on.
Wait a minute.
What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.
Really?
And how many hours do you spend with them on any given week?
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you three times what the DA's job pays.
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.
I believe in what I do.
Is that so wrong?
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?
Yeah?
Okay.
They want me back.
- Right away, sir.
- Good.
Because I don't.
I'm sorry.
Please remember to put the cover back on the Hawk.
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.
I've received the following note from the jurors.
"We have voted several times.
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.
Would you like to set the matter for retrial?
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
Blades?
I don't care what the jury did.
You're on leave until you deal with Internal Affairs.
Do you hear me?
Until I say so, you are not police.
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA, they're gonna rush out and get my name tattooed across their butt cheeks.
- Give me five.
- Nice going.
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?
Was in Interview 4, but Schaefer needed the room so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate?
I'm buying.
You're buying?
Or is Gil buying?
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.
He was carrying the paper the cash when I popped him.
Then some ape in a wool ski mask came at me with a piece.
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?
There's numbers and letters circled all over it.
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.
I tried to decipher it but Gold's closing was distracting.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
I'll go sit on Gil.
Blades strikes me as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.
He's dirty.
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.
Yes, exactly.
We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.
I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.
Trust cops to deal with cops?
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.
Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?
Turns out, it's mostly grays.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.
Am I supposed to see the forest or mostly grays?
Look, everything I know comes from you.
A much younger and stupider me.
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.
Good.
Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.
You're kidding?
Grant Stone?
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.
And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.
So do the judges.
Most of the defense bar.
I should start caring about defense lawyers?
Everybody in the system gets chewed up, Theo.
Including the poor bastards we send to prison.
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--
Theo.
Take some time off.
Go home.
Look in the mirror.
I need Gil Ott for an interview.
- Not here.
- Where is he?
Check again.
Detective Schaefer brought him earlier.
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want?
I just came on.
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.
What the crap?
Come on.
What's up with the sneak attack?
License, registration, proof of insurance.
I'm a DA.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
License.
My registration.
Have you had anything to drink tonight, Mr. Gould, is it?
It's Gold.
Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.
Mr. Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.
If you do not calm down, I will have to place you under arrest.
Are you joking?
What is all this about?
- Please step out of the car.
- No.
Mr. Gold, please step out of the vehicle now.
I am placing you under arrest.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.
- No, I'm not.
- You are definitely resisting arrest.
What are you talking about?
If you continue to resist arrest, I will Tase you.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.
Make the call.
Let's go 10-99.
Detective Nick Blades there's something shocking you should see, State and Chestnut.
Get the hell away from me.
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.
Just leave me alone.
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.
I've seen Tomorrow, Again like 50 times.
Please don't speak to me.
What happened?
Two policemen kidnapped and Tased me.
Friends of yours, I presume.
I've never been Tased myself.
Imagine the worst dental appointment of all time.
You got lucky, detective.
It won't happen again.
I've always been lucky.
Today's my birthday.
I hope it's the best one ever.
Kelly!
No, no.
Don't do this to me.
Kelly.
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead apparently, your precious Hawk is missing and you may remember, I'm going to my parents until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.
Just give me a little more time to explain to the kids.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys.
Daddy loves you.
See you soon.
This asshole must be having the worst day of his life.
He just called in to report that someone stole his car out of his driveway.
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?
You know what happens when you wake up in the morning and you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad?
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.
Anarchy.
And the Cubs win the World Series.
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.
We've done our share of fooling around over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.
It's time for him to hang up his sword and die with something approaching dignity.
Mom, I don't need to hear this.
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.
I thought it was the cancer, so I didn't push.
But now I know.
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.
What time are you picking us up for lunch?
Theo?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.
- So take the van.
- It's dead.
Again?
All right, you have my permission to use the Hawk, just be very careful.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What's wrong with the Hawk?
I don't believe this.
I gotta go.
If something happens to that automobile, it'll kill your father.
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.
Move out of the street.
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.
Please move out of the street or I'll have to cite you.
I'm bleeding here.
I'm bleeding here.
Move now.
My car was stolen.
I saw the guy driving it around the corner two minutes ago.
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh?
Shocking.
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.
I don't see anything.
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.
You know, I'm about to go off shift if you want a ride downtown.
Thank you.
Okay, Blades, so now you're buying two dinners.
And not the Whole Foods deli again, either.
Someplace where they bring food to the table.
Let's see what you got, then we'll decide.
Well, it was code.
Forensics figures it for driver's license numbers.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep.
And it's four local Louisiana plates.
It's just that there are three extra letters.
WVB or BVW, depending on how you read it.
But one of the cars is registered to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.
If we have the list and Gil's in jail, how does the car get stolen?
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.
Check with Schaefer and Chin.
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses on my way to Gil's.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
Blades.
Goddamn it.
If you're out there impersonating a police officer, I will pinch you myself.
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.
In the meantime, I'm having my teeth cleaned and maybe a trim.
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.
So as soon as we can unplug an officer from another matter, we'll be with you.
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor and tell him to come out here now.
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
I understand that my reputation precedes me.
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour my car was stolen, and I just want a little help.
That's all.
Despite the fact you've been trying to put one of my best cops in jail I find this conversation scintillating.
You, in fact, may describe it as electrifying.
- How you doing?
- Good.
I'm detective Nick Blades, New Orleans police.
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.
- Your parents home?
- No.
- They at work?
- No.
- I give up.
Where are they?
- Dead.
My grandma says that if she was on the jury she'd vote to send you to jail.
I guess I'm glad your grandma's not on the jury.
My grandma says you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am.
Your grandma take care of you?
- Yeah.
- Is she home?
No.
Is that your grandma's car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?
- Yeah.
- Is he home?
- No.
- Where's he?
- Jail.
Does he get out soon?
My grandma said it depends if his jury is as dumb as yours.
Tell your grandma to lock the car up tight.
All right.
- Hand over the money already.
- It's not like it's because you got nothing.
Yeah, well.
It's okay, guys.
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot?
He just said that.
Never heard of you.
Let's see it.
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.
Enjoy.
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know.
Ask him.
What you want with Gil?
Where is the little creep?
After he robbed 400 off me, he didn't leave no forwarding address.
- You see him with this guy?
- No.
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?
All I know is, last time I saw him, he was okay.
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.
I chose Olive Garden.
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?
Thank you.
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.
I also took that off Gil.
Call 911.
Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.
I'm sure they'll find it.
But with my luck, somebody will probably have peed in it.
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.
Well, also in the meantime my wife is taking away my kids, my car was stolen and because of Blades, I'm getting no help from the cops.
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.
I should have listened.
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.
That's much better than rotting teeth.
You mentioned the Van Beber case.
Here's the murder book.
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.
And everyone was mad at me for not dealing.
The judge was mad at me for ruining his summer vacation.
The boss didn't want me tied up for three months.
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.
Plead it.
Settle it.
Compromise.
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.
Grab that, will you?
- Hello?
- Kelly you get your husband on the phone right now.
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger about our problems like it's CNN.
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly he insisted we come to your house.
When you weren't here, he got very upset and locked himself...
- ...in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?
Apparently.
He must've had it in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears...
- ...
like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.
You can buy guns in vending machines now.
- Call the cops.
- No.
I will not have some SWAT team blasting through the door scaring your father to death.
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I gotta go.
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.
Where'd you get those tickets?
Kinko's?
Nice pants.
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?
He's been threatening to kill himself for the last 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.
Herb, I want the truth.
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.
Along with everything else, he's cheating.
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?
Herb.
What did you do?
- Wait.
- Marty.
Holy moly.
Put down the gun.
- Oh, Lord.
Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.
He's not well, Nick.
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky.
He won't shoot Marty.
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.
You need a haircut.
I said I'd stay with him in sickness and in health.
Now he's sick and I'm staying.
But I can't abide the cheating.
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.
Just follow him.
I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?
I heard about your son's car being stolen, thought I could help.
What car?
- Oh, my God.
The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.
Detective Blades happened to stop by and everything's under control.
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.
He's agreed to help find the car.
And the other matter?
Forget the other matter for the moment.
You and Theo find the Hawk.
I'll do everything I can to keep this from your father.
I'll expect regular reports.
- She wants reports.
- I heard.
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.
This is a very comfortable mattress.
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.
Kelly bought it.
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?
Same reason everybody buys one.
It's a crazy world out there, son.
And I got like 30 percent off.
Don't you tell your mother.
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.
Am I dreaming this or is your Uncle Marty here?
Uncle Marty?
Of course, he had to leave.
Took my gun.
I think that's probably for the best.
Theo, your mother has to try this mattress.
I mean, it is incredible.
You should try it.
Come on.
Try it.
Come on.
Yeah.
So?
It is.
It's a great mattress.
It is sublime is what it is.
Yeah.
It's nice.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck.
Monday, on a ship.
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.
Trust me, you're not getting any play from the department.
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.
You get your way, I'm gonna need all the money I can scrape together.
I'm not dropping the charges, even if you do find the car.
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.
- You know him?
- How would I know him?
Gil was carrying a newspaper with plates numbers written in code on it.
Your plate number was on the list.
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye on the Hawk.
It's a very nice car.
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.
I wasted every weekend of my childhood working on that damn car.
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.
I get it.
So, what do we do?
We go see Ott, you slap him around a little he tells us where my car is?
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court, so I had to park him.
While you were blasting me in front of the jury, he slipped.
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.
But I'll assume that he delivered a copy of the list once he got out.
So how do we find my car?
How should I know?
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.
Although, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.
Don't do that.
What--?
What--?
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?
I'm a lawyer.
My mind is my weapon.
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me long before I find your car.
Come on.
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.
Why are we here?
Come on, let's go.
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.
Gentlemen, we honor the master and the practice by bowing when we enter the dojo.
We're police.
You Edward Mackie?
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.
Are you insane?
Ever see that scene in Indiana jones where he watches some guy with a big sword do his thing and then shoots him?
In this situation, I'm Indy.
Move.
Now.
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--
Move.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Theodore, put thing down before you kill someone.
Hey.
Hey, give me a break.
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?
It's already in the book.
Thanks for everything.
That's why those people are so widely despised.
There's no give and take.
No compromise.
What does any of this have to do with my car?
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.
In prison, he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect, looking for Gil at his father's place.
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names before I do more good deeds.
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning.
He's in jail.
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?
The boy's running so he must have burned somebody.
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.
I seem to recall something about my mother paying you to find my car?
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?
Possibly.
There seems to be a connection between gangs and the list.
Before I was chief assistant, I did head up the gang prosecution unit.
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?
- Really.
- Isn't he about to be executed?
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on, move, move.
- You, too.
- Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.
No, thanks.
You're like a walking cliché.
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.
Brother Blades.
So nice to see you.
Happy, this is my partner, Roberto Clemente.
The sainted ballplayer.
It's my honor.
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott and he ends up locked up.
You know anything about that?
I heard some old guys kicked the shit out him.
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.
Give me six maple, two glazed, and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.
And I'll need the paper back when you're done reading it.
It's like warm maple syrup being poured over your tongue.
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.
Why do they never see that coming?
What a waste of 50 grand.
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.
That one on the list?
Yep.
It's mine.
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.
Yeah.
I'll make sure to use my Club.
That was my guy yesterday, outside the bar.
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.
Why a wool mask in July?
I was hoping to grab Gil before he delivered the paper.
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.
No, the paper wasn't for me.
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily bad reputation, Blades.
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor convicts on the four yard at Angola.
I was one of them.
It was a social club.
I understand you've since diversified considerably.
And like all other complex organizations, we have our internal differences.
The newspaper was a delivery from Willie Van Beber to a pro hitter, identity unknown.
You know who Van Beber is?
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.
He's running out of time.
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?
I believe I do.
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.
I need Gil because he's the one that can ID the person out on the street taking orders from Van Beber.
- Still with me?
- Yeah.
If you hadn't popped Gil, I'd have his contact and it would be over.
I'm genuinely sorry.
I had no idea my nose was in your business.
- Yeah.
These things happen.
- So where's Ed?
Ed's dead.
Or will be shortly.
And you better keep your eye on your little pal Roberto the DA because if he's not on the list, he will be.
You know he's the one that put Willie down.
He's on the list.
Like I said, find Gil.
Get his contact, take him off the street, or feed him to me.
Then, hopefully, Van Beber will go to his great reward and I'll get back to my goddamn doughnuts.
- Blades.
- It's not cars.
It's bodies.
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
I mind.
You're putting my life at risk and those of everyone around you.
Idiot!
Hey, I'm back.
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?
How many non-Whole Foods dinners am I up to?
I'm going to prison soon.
Two of out of the three have federal jackets.
Happy Conners is a snitch?
That's hard to believe.
Negative.
It's Ed Mackie and Dean Nickerson are the informants.
- Which agency?
- FBI.
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy named Willie Van Beber.
Know him?
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.
Very soon.
This is his last hurrah.
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber the names of the informants.
Who has access to the FBI informant database?
Anyone senior in this department or in any other in the region, state or federal.
Why is Gold on the list though?
I'm sure there's more than a few who wanna smoke Gold.
I expect it's because he put Van Beber on death row.
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?
No, we put this out there, our leaky cop evaporates.
True.
Glass finds out I'm working this, he'll have a coronary.
I don't need that.
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?
- Come on!
What are you doing?
- No.
Come on!
Dude!
You coming?
Five-0 in the house.
Was that really necessary?
I keep my love of food and my professional life separate.
- Fatty.
- Blades.
Give me a slab to go with the sauce on the side.
I heard you paid off that jury.
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.
Along with my order, I'll need an address on Gil Ott.
I don't know no Gil.
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.
And I do know me a Bill.
Theodore, assume for a moment most of the people in this place are on parole, probation or otherwise in the system.
How long would it take for me to find out one of them is in possession of a gun resulting in their immediate and protracted incarceration?
You ain't even no police.
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Feel free to call me any time within the next five minutes.
Yeah.
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.
Most importantly, what does any of it have to do with finding my car?
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.
Talk to me.
Thanks, Fatty.
I owe you.
Hey.
You can't just go and do whatever you want in life, Blades.
There are systems and rules.
These systems and rules exist for a reason.
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.
And not once have you just cut a corner, just bent a little.
You know what the United States Supreme Court says?
United States Supreme Court says a prosecutor is a representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy.
No, sir.
As a prosecutor, I am the representative of our sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective my solemn obligation is not to win cases, but to do justice.
I make one wrong move, I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.
It's very tiring to be around you.
You just bought a slab of ribs.
You kidding me?
The last time I ate at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.
This place rocks.
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?
I'm feeling really lost.
Can you try and explain to me what's happening?
Your car look anything like that?
That's it.
I don't believe this.
That's it.
That's my car.
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.
Give me the keys.
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear on how important that car is to my father.
To me.
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
- It's not.
I need to find that car, Blades.
My family is gone, my career is shit, my mother's insane and my father's dying.
The one thing I got half a chance of doing is finding that car.
And if you can't or won't help me, then goddamn it, I will do it myself.
Get off.
Get off.
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.
Hello?
I'm kidnapped.
Here, here.
This is why this country's going in the toilet.
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.
I just saw him.
Called from the trunk of his car after you told me about the list.
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk?
What happened?
A pro, for sure.
You were right about Mackie, he was working for us.
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.
Mackie would have put him down forever.
I was actually figuring Happy for the body.
I don't think so.
Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.
- You know Willie Van Beber?
- 4-4 number-one shot caller?
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.
Van Beber's settling up before he gets executed.
They wanna kill each other, it's fine with me.
Start smoking my informants, I get annoyed.
I mean, Mackie means we lose two ongoing investigations.
He made the list for putting Van Beber on the row.
- How nice.
Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.
After you get your delivery boy, plug the damn leak.
We're not even looking for my car.
I doubt we ever were.
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?
These things take time.
Have faith.
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.
I don't understand.
Why are we waiting?
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we just go in and get Gil Ott now?
Fools rush in, my friend.
I hate golf.
Other than working on the Hawk, this was the one thing my father and I did together.
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs around people's necks.
You just have to relax.
How?
Before you swing, breathe.
Okay, time's up.
I'll go get him.
If Gil Ott's in there, you think my car is nearby?
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
Until about two seconds ago, pretty good.
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?
- Out where?
- Jail.
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead.
Okay?
Paper had the name of 4-4's, two of which were federal snitches.
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
It also had the name of a DA named Theo Gold, who also happens to be a friend.
You get the needle for whacking a DA.
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.
You're the only one who can ID the source which is why I assume you're whacked out in this caddy shack shit hole.
That's just rude.
I live here.
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.
Everybody wants you, Gil.
Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
Sit down.
I need your contact.
One name.
Give me that name and maybe I'll let you live so you can remodel.
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.
Back inside.
Now!
You want me to go after them or get those off you?
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.
Did you ask about the car?
I forgot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Nothing nine Band-Aids and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.
I did predict you'd shoot me.
I remember.
I decided I wanted to live more than I want my car.
My father will understand that.
I'll take you home.
Just drop me off at my parents'.
I'll break the news.
I can already see his face.
God, I'd do anything to avoid that slightly disappointed but not altogether surprised look.
You know the look?
Please.
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old daughter I see one weekend a month.
I know the look.
Theo, go get him before one of the neighbors calls the police.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- What are you doing?
Call you in a bit.
I can't tell whether I'm being guarded or surveilled.
Your little redheaded co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really?
Why?
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on.
That's ridiculous.
She can go to any private firm in this city and make five times what she's making.
She doesn't need to sell informant data for money, okay?
- You want me to call her?
Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore.
Maybe later.
My mother wants you to come in for my belated birthday dinner.
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?
Can you do the entire Valoise family a favor and just stay off the subject?
Please?
Did you know that Robert Evans was our neighbor for a while in California?
Of course, that was before he became huge.
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.
Apparently not so incredible that he cast me in anything.
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.
Sonny and Cher.
Bobby Redford.
Bobby had a terrible overbite.
Tell me again.
Who are you?
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.
That is very interesting.
Your son's a great lawyer.
We would have preferred if he had gone into dentistry but you give them wings, they fly away.
You know how it is, Marty.
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.
That was before anyone told me about his, you know, style.
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it?
Thank you.
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.
I used to think I had one.
Now I realize I burned it down without even knowing.
Homes get rebuilt.
All I wanted was to spend whatever time my dad has left driving around with him in the Hawk.
- Pulling plugs.
You know?
- And sending me to prison.
I figured this is the time to be a good son.
After, I'd try to be a better husband and father.
Tell me about your daughter.
She lives with her mom.
All the money I skimmed from the detective busts went toward her school.
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.
I feel horrible about it.
You expect me to drop the case because you have the same problems that everybody else does.
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.
People get divorced and pay for braces all the time...
- ...without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.
They lack opportunity.
Maybe.
I mean, my wife's family has money.
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.
You still can't tell me what we've been doing for the past day?
For the moment, no.
And the car is safely on its way to Argentina.
Bon voyage, old friend.
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.
Tomorrow, Again, again and again and again.
- It's a great movie.
- Yeah.
She's not your mother.
What's that about your mother?
Theo was just telling me that Lena's not my mother.
You didn't know that?
I told you, detective, my father dropped me off at the hotel.
I was alone.
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.
- I can't help it.
- Try.
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.
He was there with you.
He used three capital letters to sign for the drink.
WMP.
William McPherson.
Why do you hate me?
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.
That scene kills me every time.
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.
- WVB?
- Yeah.
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.
Makes sense, but we figured it came from him.
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl and she says Gil snitched for her in a possession case last year.
So she felt like she owed him a favor.
Gil gave her some story about the hold being trumped up.
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.
Check and see if Van Beber has any kids.
Nick, what the heck are you doing in there?
- I gotta go.
Just check.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?
You say you'll bring it back and I nod like a robot?
I'll take him.
Just let me get this.
Yo.
Detective Blades?
It's Rosalyn Wohl.
- Yes?
- Who is that?
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?
He says he'll give you the guy who's killing the people on the list.
All right.
Where?
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.
Just do what he says.
- What does Gil want?
- The list.
- Why?
- If he gets the list back his employer refrains from putting a bullet in his ear.
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.
You don't have the list.
Happy took it.
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?
You know all those bad people you sent to prison?
They ever call to say thanks?
No.
Sometimes I send people to prison for doing bad things.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people.
I appreciate that.
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?
Apparently his last wish is for you to precede him to the promised land.
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo.
Too dangerous.
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car.
Don't give me a gun.
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.
- You trust me?
- I trust you.
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.
- Yeah.
- Happy.
Blades.
If you're not too busy making doughnuts I could use some backup.
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?
Well, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?
- Gold, yes.
Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.
Let's go.
Now.
Come on.
You're staying with me.
Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
- Wonderful.
Hands on your head.
Hands.
Come on.
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?
I don't know.
Am I supposed to know?
Oh, shit.
Call 911 and stay with the car.
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.
I ran into your father, Gil.
- He's worried about you.
- My father?
That's funny.
That's really-- That's hilarious.
- Where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.
Bullshit.
Give me the goddamn paper.
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.
And you don't really need it anyway.
Hands up on your head.
I'm really sorry about the way this ends, detective.
I had such a good time watching you in trial.
You were the happiest defendant I've ever seen.
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.
You know you were right.
About the list?
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.
You're not the first to say so, although you may be the last.
Thought that kidnapping thing sounded fishy.
I knew you'd respond to a lady in distress.
That's no way to treat an employee.
Independent contractor.
I thought I was doing you a favor though, killing Gold.
He wants to put you away.
Once you know him, his intentions are good.
That's very magnanimous.
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.
So, yeah, sad story all around.
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.
Police!
A few of my dad's friends.
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.
Oh, shit.
Blades.
You could have put my father away for life.
Instead you had to kill him?
- I'm sorry.
I was just doing my job.
- No compromises.
No deals.
Right?
Well, guess what.
No deal for you either.
Don't move.
Yeah, well, Wohl was her mother's maiden name.
Van Beber never married her.
I hate to admit it, Blades, but you're not a half-bad detective.
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath the next 85 years.
Are we still on for Whole Foods?
You bet.
Want a ride to work in the morning?
Sure.
How very gallant of you.
Thanks.
- It's tomorrow.
- Again.
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.
That is good.
- That's bad.
- That is bad.
Still going after my dad for adultery?
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.
It's a fantasy.
He never cheated on her.
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God.
More fantasy.
Does my mother have any actual evidence of this affair?
Her theory is that he takes his girl or girls to this hotel.
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I found the car.
If the Hawk was supposed to be on its way to Argentina why did it keep popping up over town?
Excellent question.
You wouldn't expect a thief to steal it then tool around.
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.
Except when driving the Hawk.
He would never take a mistress to a swank hotel.
He would park the car in a hotel garage if it meant keeping it off the street.
Yes!
What do you say?
I get a turn at the wheel of this beauty?
All right, you've earned it.
You just go very easy, okay?
She likes to be rewed a lot before she downshifts.
- Taser boy?
- Yes?
Relax.
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.
You have to convince 12 jurors, including at least a few females.
Yes.
Yes.
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?
Letting you drive!
Apologize to your father for me.
Dad, I am really, really sorry.
Is he dead?
He never stood a chance against the Hawk.
Who is he?
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.
I guess killing his daughter didn't endear us to him.
We got lucky.
I've never been lucky.
Thanks.
For what?
Keeping me alive.
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.
So speaking of you sending me to prison....
We were?
Admittedly, I've had some lapses of judgment.
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses here and there.
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.
Thanks for showing me the forest and the grays.
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?
What am I gonna tell my dad?
Tell him how much you love him.
The rest is pretty much paint by numbers.
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.
Son.
Hey.
Dad.
What time is it?
I have some bad news.
What?
Where's mom?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay.
Mom is fine.
She's fine.
Now, look, Theo.
I don't want you to overreact or anything but it appears as if the Hawk has been stolen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.
Me?
That car meant everything in the world to you.
Everything?
No, no, no.
It's a fine automobile but you know what I always say:
It's just a car.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.
We interviewed a few jurors after the mistrial they seemed pretty unimpressed, so we walked away.
But the fact that you decided to dismiss the case doesn't mean Detective Blades is innocent.
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.
I understand you spent time with Detective Blades looking for your car, which you reported stolen?
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.
Looks like you and Detective Blades had quite an adventure.
Detective Blades was instrumental in uncovering a damaging leak that was in our office.
A leak which had already resulted in the death of an FBI informant.
That's very impressive.
Look you knew at the time that Detective Blades was on administrative leave and he had specific orders not to do any police work.
My mother hired him as a Pl to look for the car.
Which your father had.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
I bet Detective Blades went out of his way not to mislead anyone about his status.
He never flipped his badge, right?
Never brandished his gun?
Never once in your presence identified himself as a police officer?
Technically, no.
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
My head.
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil.
How you been?
Move.
Move.
I said move.
First of all, A, I'm a cop.
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.
Doesn't it get itchy?
Sweaty?
The paper.
Even though your face is covered, I can tell, you need a hug.
- Back off.
- Come on.
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.
No love?
Really?
You coming?
- What did I do?
- How should I know?
You gonna pick that up?
Hurry, I gotta go to court.
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come on, man.
You can't look me up for walking down the street.
Guy with the persuader pointed at my head?
I don't know that guy.
- What's in the paper?
- News.
Newspaper.
Wallet.
And the gun.
Okay, easy tiger.
What's with the paper?
This is a really unsatisfying conversation.
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?
Better than you.
He took my money.
And when you tell me what I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.
Off to dance with Lady Justice.
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.
I've always been lucky.
Hey.
What the hell?
Firearm.
Thank you, sir.
You're Lena Valoise.
I was.
Tomorrow, Again is one of my favorite movies.
Me too.
- Nick.
- How do you do?
Great.
What are you doing here?
I've come to see my son, the assistant DA.
Me too.
- You must be very proud.
- I must.
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.
- You look a little lost.
- I am.
Courtroom 3?
Come.
I'll show you.
We call it the thin blue line, the police.
The fragile barrier between the bad guys and you.
We give policemen like Detective Nick Blades guns.
We pay them well.
And all we ask in return is that they do what they swear they'll do.
Protect and serve.
But what happens if they break that promise?
What happens if one day you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys?
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold care to join us in this case?
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.
Anarchy.
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.
- Mr. Gold ...
- You know what?
I still do.
I believe there is such a thing as right and wrong.
I believe in an irrepressible commitment to the truth.
An irreproachable moral and ethical code that cannot be compromised.
Detective Blades thought he could be the law, but not follow it.
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.
That's wrong.
Thank you.
We will adjourn for the day.
First time he called the police on me he was 9.
- What'd you do?
- I took away his LEG-Os.
Mr. Gold.
Your reaction to the DA's decision to retire?
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.
Do you have any comments on a frontrunner for the interim slot?
I've been dealing with police corruption.
It doesn't leave a lot of time to deal with office personnel matters.
Do you plan on attending Willie Van Beber's execution?
I did my job, ...putting Willie Van Beber right where he belongs.
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner take it from there.
Excuse me.
You people don't mind if I borrow my son, the assistant DA, do you?
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.
You sure you don't have an announcement to make?
Your father is having an affair.
Would you and the good Lord care to comment on that?
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?
Every time you say Dad's having sex with someone else.
Go to the country house.
Where's the van?
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.
I thought we'd agree we only use the Hawk in an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1:30.
Honey, this car represents the last fragile thread of dignity holding my family together.
Take my car.
Park in my spot.
Theo.
I thought on people's birthdays, other people are supposed to do what they want.
And I thought turning 40 meant not acting 7.
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch with the next DA.
Great.
And you'll still earn less than our gardener and I'll still be paying for lunch with my parents' credit card.
Jeez, Kelly, come on.
Don't do this.
Just give me today.
You're the one who wants to live in a house big enough for 12.
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.
I'm leaving.
I'm not done yet.
Leaving you.
Actually, you're the one leaving since my parents own the house.
I'll give you one week to get your things and get out.
Today you do this?
Today?
On my birthday?
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years I've wasted on someone going precisely nowhere?
Kelly, come on.
Wait a minute.
What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.
Really?
And how many hours do you spend with them on any given week?
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you three times what the DA's job pays.
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.
I believe in what I do.
Is that so wrong?
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?
Yeah?
Okay.
They want me back.
- Right away, sir.
- Good.
Because I don't.
I'm sorry.
Please remember to put the cover back on the Hawk.
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.
I've received the following note from the jurors.
"We have voted several times.
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.
Would you like to set the matter for retrial?
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
Blades?
I don't care what the jury did.
You're on leave until you deal with Internal Affairs.
Do you hear me?
Until I say so, you are not police.
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA, they're gonna rush out and get my name tattooed across their butt cheeks.
- Give me five.
- Nice going.
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?
Was in Interview 4, but Schaefer needed the room so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate?
I'm buying.
You're buying?
Or is Gil buying?
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.
He was carrying the paper the cash when I popped him.
Then some ape in a wool ski mask came at me with a piece.
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?
There's numbers and letters circled all over it.
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.
I tried to decipher it but Gold's closing was distracting.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
I'll go sit on Gil.
Blades strikes me as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.
He's dirty.
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.
Yes, exactly.
We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.
I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.
Trust cops to deal with cops?
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.
Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?
Turns out, it's mostly grays.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.
Am I supposed to see the forest or mostly grays?
Look, everything I know comes from you.
A much younger and stupider me.
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.
Good.
Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.
You're kidding?
Grant Stone?
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.
And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.
So do the judges.
Most of the defense bar.
I should start caring about defense lawyers?
Everybody in the system gets chewed up, Theo.
Including the poor bastards we send to prison.
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--
Theo.
Take some time off.
Go home.
Look in the mirror.
I need Gil Ott for an interview.
- Not here.
- Where is he?
Check again.
Detective Schaefer brought him earlier.
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want?
I just came on.
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.
What the crap?
Come on.
What's up with the sneak attack?
License, registration, proof of insurance.
I'm a DA.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
License.
My registration.
Have you had anything to drink tonight, Mr. Gould, is it?
It's Gold.
Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.
Mn Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.
If you do not calm down, I will have to place you under arrest.
Are you joking?
What is all this about?
- Please step out of the can
- No.
Mr. Gold, please step out of the vehicle now.
I am placing you under arrest.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.
- No, I'm not.
- You are derfinitely resisting arrest.
What are you talking about?
If you continue to resist arrest, I will Tase you.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.
Make the call.
Let's go 10-99.
Detective Nick Blades there's something shocking you should see, State and Chestnut.
Get the hell away from me.
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.
Just leave me alone.
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.
I've seen Tomorrow, Again like 50 times.
Please don't speak to me.
What happened?
Two policemen kidnapped and Tased me.
Friends of yours, I presume.
I've never been Tased myself.
Imagine the worst dental appointment of all time.
You got lucky, detective.
It won't happen again.
I've always been lucky.
Today's my birthday.
I hope it's the best one ever.
Kelly!
No, no.
Don't do this to me.
Kelly.
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead apparently, your precious Hawk is missing and you may remember, I'm going to my parents until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.
Just give me a little more time to explain to the kids.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys.
Daddy loves you.
See you soon.
This asshole must be having the worst day of his life.
He just called in to report that someone stole his car out of his driveway.
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?
You know what happens when you wake up in the morning and you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad?
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.
Anarchy.
And the Cubs win the World Series.
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.
We've done our share of fooling around over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.
It's time for him to hang up his sword and die with something approaching dignity.
Mom, I don't need to hear this.
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.
I thought it was the cancer, so I didn't push.
But now I know.
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.
What time are you picking us up for lunch?
Theo?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.
- So take the van.
-It's dead.
Again?
All right, you have my permission to use the Hawk, just be very careful.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What's wrong with the Hawk?
I don't believe this.
I gotta go.
If something happens to that automobile, it'll kill your father.
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.
Move out of the street.
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.
Please move out of the street or I'll have to cite you.
I'm bleeding here.
I'm bleeding here.
Move now.
My car was stolen.
I saw the guy driving it around the corner two minutes ago.
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh?
Shocking.
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.
I don't see anything.
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.
You know, I'm about to go off shift if you want a ride downtown.
Thank you.
Okay, Blades, so now you're buying two dinners.
And not the whole Foods deli again, either.
Someplace where they bring food to the table.
Let's see what you got, then we'll decide.
Well, it was code.
Forensics figures it for driver's license numbers.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep.
And it's four local Louisiana plates.
It's just that there are three extra letters.
WVB or BVW, depending on how you read it.
But one of the cars is registered to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.
If we have the list and Gil's in jail, how does the oar get stolen?
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.
Check with Schaefer and Chin.
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses on my way to Gil's.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
Blades.
Goddamn it.
If you're out there impersonating a police officer, I will pinch you myself.
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.
In the meantime, I'm having my teeth cleaned and maybe a trim.
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.
So as soon as we can unplug an officer from another matter, we'll be with you.
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor and tell him to come out here now.
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
I understand that my reputation precedes me.
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour my car was stolen, and I just want a little help.
That's all.
Despite the fact you've been trying to put one of my best cops in jail I find this conversation scintillating.
You, in fact, may describe it as electrifying.
- How you doing?
- Good.
I'm detective Nick Blades, New Orleans police.
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.
- Your parents home?
- No.
- They at work?
- No.
- I give up.
Where are they?
- Dead.
My grandma says that if she was on the jury she'd vote to send you to jail.
I guess I'm glad your grandma's not on the jury.
My grandma says you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am.
Your grandma take care of you?
- Yeah.
- Is she home?
No.
Is that your grandma's car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?
- Yeah.
- Is he home?
- No.
- Where's he?
- Jail.
Does he get out soon?
My grandma said it depends if his jury is as dumb as yours.
Tell your grandma to lock the car up tight.
All right.
- Hand over the money already.
-It's not like it's because you got nothing.
Yeah, well.
It's okay, guys.
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot?
He just said that.
Never heard of you.
Let 's see it.
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.
Enjoy.
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know.
Ask him.
What you want with Gil?
Where is the little creep?
After he robbed 400 off me, he didn't leave no forwarding address.
- You see him with this guy?
- No.
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?
All I know is, last time I saw him, he was okay.
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.
I chose Olive Garden.
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?
Thank you.
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.
I also took that off Gil.
Call 911.
Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.
I'm sure they'll find it.
But with my luck, somebody will probably have peed in it.
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.
Well, also in the meantime my wife is taking away my kids, my car was stolen and because of Blades, I'm getting no help from the cops.
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.
I should have listened.
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.
That's much better than rotting teeth.
You mentioned the Van Beber case.
Here's the murder book.
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.
And everyone was mad at me for not dealing.
The judge was mad at me for ruining his summer vacation.
The boss didn't want me tied up for three months.
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.
Plead it.
Settle it.
Compromise.
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.
Grab that, will you?
- Hello?
- Kelly you get your husband on the phone right now.
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger about our problems like it's CNN.
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly he insisted We come to your house.
When you weren't here, he got very upset and locked himself in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?
Apparently.
He must've had it in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.
You can buy guns in vending machines now.
- Call the cops.
- No.
I will not have some SWAT team blasting through the door scaring your father to death.
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I gotta go.
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.
Where'd you get those tickets?
Kinko's?
Nice pants.
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?
He's been threatening to kill himself for the last 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.
Herb, I want the truth.
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.
Along with everything else, he's cheating.
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?
Herb.
What did you do?
- Wait.
- Marty.
Holy moly.
Put down the gun.
- Oh, Lord.
Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.
He's not well, Nick.
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky.
He won't shoot Marty.
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.
You need a haircut.
I said I'd stay with him in sickness and in health.
Now he's sick and I'm staying.
But I can't abide the cheating.
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.
Just follow him.
I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?
I heard about your son's car being stolen, thought I could help.
What car?
- Oh, my God.
The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.
Detective Blades happened to stop by and everything's under control.
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.
He's agreed to help find the car.
And the other matter?
Forget the other matter for the moment.
You and Theo find the Hawk.
I'll do everything I can to keep this from your father.
I'll expect regular reports.
- She wants reports.
- I heard.
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.
This is a very comfortable mattress.
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.
Kelly bought it.
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?
Same reason everybody buys one.
It's a crazy world out there, son.
And I got like 30 percent off.
Don't you tell your mother.
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.
Am I dreaming this or is your Uncle Marty here?
Uncle Marty?
Of course, he had to leave.
Took my gun.
I think that's probably for the best.
Theo, your mother has to try this mattress.
I mean, it is incredible.
You should try it.
Come on.
Try it.
Come on.
Yeah.
So?
It is. it's a great mattress.
It is sublime is what it is.
Yeah.
It's nice.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck.
Monday, on a ship.
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.
Trust me, you're not getting any play from the department.
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.
You get your way, I'm gonna need all the money I can scrape together.
I'm not dropping the charges, even if you do find the car.
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.
- You know him?
- How would I know him?
Gil was carrying a newspaper with plates numbers written in code on it.
Your plate number was on the list.
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye on the Hawk. it's a very nice car.
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.
I wasted every weekend of my childhood working on that damn car.
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.
I get it.
So, what do we do?
We go see Ott, you slap him around a little he tells us where my car is?
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court, so I had to park him.
While you were blasting me in front of the jury, he slipped.
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.
But I'll assume that he delivered a copy of the list once he got out.
So how do we find my oar?
How should I know?
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.
Although, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.
Don't do that.
What--?
What--?
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?
I'm a lawyer.
My mind is my weapon.
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me long before I find your car.
Come on.
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.
Why are we here?
Come on, let's go.
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.
Gentlemen, we honor the master and the practice by bowing when we enter the dojo.
We're police.
You Edward Mackie?
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.
Are you insane?
Ever see that scene in Indiana Jones where he watches some guy with a big sword do his thing and then shoots him?
In this situation, I'm Indy.
Move.
Now.
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--
Move.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Theodore, put thing down before you kill someone.
Hey.
Hey, give me a break.
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?
It's already in the book.
Thanks for everything.
That's why those people are so widely despised.
There's no give and take.
No compromise.
What does any of this have to do with my car?
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.
In prison, he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect, looking for Gil at his father's place.
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names before I do more good deeds.
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning.
He's in jail.
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?
The boy's running so he must have burned somebody.
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.
I seem to recall something about my mother paying you to find my car?
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?
Possibly.
There seems to be a connection between gangs and the list.
Before I was chief assistant, I did head up the gang prosecution unit.
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?
- Really.
-Isn't he about to be executed?
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on, move, move.
- You, too.
- Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.
No, thanks.
You're like a walking cliché.
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.
Brother Blades.
So nice to see you.
Happy, this is my partner, Roberto Clemente.
The sainted ballplayer. it's my honor.
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott and he ends up locked up.
You know anything about that?
I heard some old guys kicked the shit out him.
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.
Give me six maple, two glazed, and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.
And I'll need the paper back when you're done reading it.
It's like warm maple syrup being poured over your tongue.
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.
Why do they never see that coming?
What a waste of 50 grand.
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.
That one on the list?
Yep.
It's mine.
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.
Yeah.
I'll make sure to use my Club.
That was my guy yesterday, outside the bar.
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.
Why a wool mask in July?
I was hoping to grab Gil before he delivered the paper.
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.
No, the paper wasn't for me.
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily bad reputation, Blades.
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor convicts on the four yard at Angola.
I was one of them.
It was a social club.
I understand you've since diversified considerably.
And like all other complex organizations, we have our internal differences.
The newspaper was a delivery from Willie Van Beber to a pro hitter, identity unknown.
You know who Van Beber is?
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.
He's running out of time.
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?
I believe I do.
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.
I need Gil because he's the one that can ID the person out on the street taking orders from Van Beber.
- Still with me?
- Yeah.
If you hadn't popped Gil, I'd have his contact and it would be over.
I'm genuinely sorry.
I had no idea my nose was in your business.
- Yeah.
These things happen.
- So where's Ed?
Ed's dead.
Or will be shortly.
And you better keep your eye on your little pal Roberto the DA because if he's not on the list, he will be.
You know he's the one that put Willie down.
He's on the list.
Like I said, find Gil.
Get his contact, take him off the street, or feed him to me.
Then, hopefully, Van Beber will go to his great reward and I'll get back to my goddamn doughnuts.
- Blades.
-It's not cars. it's bodies.
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
I mind.
You're putting my life at risk and those of everyone around you.
Idiot!
Hey, I'm back.
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?
How many non-Whole Foods dinners am I up to?
I'm going to prison soon.
Two of out of the three have federal jackets.
Happy Conners is a Snitch?
That's hard to believe.
Negative. it's Ed Mackie and Dean Nickerson are the informants.
- Which agency?
- FBI.
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy named Willie Van Beber.
Know him?
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.
Very soon.
This is his last hurrah.
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber the names of the informants.
Who has access to the FBI informant database?
Anyone senior in this department or in any other in the region, state or federal.
Why is Gold on the list though?
I'm sure there's more than a few who wanna smoke Gold.
I expect it's because he put Van Beber on death row.
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?
No, we put this out there, our leaky cop evaporates.
True.
Glass finds out I'm working this, he'll have a coronary.
I don't need that.
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?
- Come on!
What are you doing?
- No.
Come on!
Dude!
You coming?
Five-0 in the house.
Was that really necessary?
I keep my love of food and my professional life separate.
- Fatty.
- Blades.
Give me a slab to go with the sauce on the side.
I heard you paid off that jury.
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.
Along with my order, I'll need an address on Gil Ott.
I don't know no Gil.
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.
And I do know me a Bill.
Theodore, assume for a moment most of the people in this place are on parole, probation or otherwise in the system.
How long would it take for me to find out one of them is in possession of a gun resulting in their immediate and protracted incarceration?
You ain't even no police.
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Feel free to call me any time within the next five minutes.
Yeah.
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.
Most importantly, what does any of it have to do with finding my car?
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.
Talk to me.
Thanks, Fatty.
I owe you.
Hey.
You can't just go and do whatever you want in life, Blades.
There are systems and rules.
These systems and rules exist for a reason.
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.
And not once have you just cut a corner, just bent a little.
You know what the United States Supreme Court says?
United States Supreme Court says a prosecutor is a representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy.
No, sir.
As a prosecutor, I am the representative of our sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective my solemn obligation is not to win cases, but to do justice.
I make one wrong move, I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.
It's very tiring to be around you.
You just bought a slab of ribs.
You kidding me?
The last time I ate at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.
This place rocks.
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?
I'm feeling really lost.
Can you try and explain to me what's happening?
Your car look anything like that?
That's it.
I don't believe this.
That's it.
That's my car.
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.
Give me the keys.
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear on how important that oar is to my father.
To me.
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
-It's not.
I need to find that car, Blades.
My family is gone, my career is shit, my mother's insane and my father's dying.
The one thing I got half a chance of doing is finding that car.
And if you can't or won't help me, then goddamn it, I will do it myself.
Get off.
Get off.
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.
Hello?
I'm kidnapped.
Here, here.
This is why this country's going in the toilet.
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.
I just saw him.
Called from the trunk of his car after you told me about the list.
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk?
What happened?
A pro, for sure.
You were right about Mackie, he was working for us.
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.
Mackie would have put him down forever.
I was actually figuring Happy for the body.
I don't think so.
Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.
- You know Willie Van Beber?
-4-4 number-one shot caller?
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.
Van Beber's settling up before he gets executed.
They wanna kill each other, it's fine with me.
Start smoking my informants, I get annoyed.
I mean, Mackie means we lose two ongoing investigations.
He made the list for putting Van Beber on the row.
- How nice.
Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.
After you get your delivery boy, plug the damn leak.
We're not even looking for my oar.
I doubt we ever were.
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?
These things take time.
Have faith.
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.
I don't understand.
Why are we waiting?
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we just go in and get Gil Ott now?
Fools rush in, my friend.
I hate golf.
Other than working on the Hawk, this was the one thing my father and I did together.
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs around people's necks.
You just have to relax.
H ow?
Before you swing, breathe.
Okay, time's up.
I'll go get him.
If Gil Ott's in there, you think my car is nearby?
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
Until about two seconds ago, pretty good.
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?
- Out where?
- Jail.
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead.
Okay?
Paper had the name of 4-4's, two of which were federal snitches.
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
It also had the name of a DA named Theo Gold, who also happens to be a friend.
You get the needle for whacking a DA.
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.
You're the only one who can ID the source which is why I assume you're whacked out in this caddy shack shit hole.
That's just rude.
I live here.
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.
Everybody wants you, Gil.
Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
Sit down.
I need your contact.
One name.
Give me that name and maybe I'll let you live so you can remodel.
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.
Back inside.
Now!
You want me to go after them or get those off you?
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.
Did you ask about the car?
I forgot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Nothing nine Band-Aids and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.
I did predict you'd shoot me.
I remember.
I decided I wanted to live more than I want my car.
My father will understand that.
I'll take you home.
Just drop me off at my parents'.
I'll break the news.
I can already see his face.
God, I'd do anything to avoid that slightly disappointed but not altogether surprised look.
You know the look?
Please.
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old daughter I see one weekend a month.
I know the look.
Theo, go get him before one of the neighbors calls the police.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- What are you doing?
Call you in a bit.
I can't tell whether I'm being guarded or surveilled.
Your little redheaded co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really?
Why?
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on.
That's ridiculous.
She can go to any private firm in this city and make five times what she's making.
She doesn't need to sell informant data for money, okay?
- You want me to call her?
Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore.
Maybe later.
My mother wants you to come in for my belated birthday dinner.
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?
Can you do the entire Valoise family a favor and just stay off the subject?
Please?
Did you know that Robert Evans was our neighbor for a while in California?
Of course, that was before he became huge.
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.
Apparently not so incredible that he cast me in anything.
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.
Sonny and Cher.
Bobby Redford.
Bobby had a terrible overbite.
Tell me again.
Who are you?
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.
That is very interesting.
Your son's a great lawyer.
We would have preferred if he had gone into dentistry but you give them wings, they fly away.
You know how it is, Marty.
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.
That was before anyone told me about his, you know, style.
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it?
Thank you.
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.
I used to think I had one.
Now I realize I burned it down without even knowing.
Homes get rebuilt.
All I wanted was to spend whatever time my dad has left driving around with him in the Hawk.
- Pulling plugs.
You know?
- And sending me to prison.
I figured this is the time to be a good son.
After, I'd try to be a better husband and father.
Tell me about your daughter.
She lives with her mom.
All the money I skimmed from the detective busts went toward her school.
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.
I feel horrible about it.
You expect me to drop the case because you have the same problems that everybody else does.
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.
People get divorced and pay for braces all the time without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.
They lack opportunity.
Maybe.
I mean, my wife's family has money.
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.
You still can't tell me what we've been doing for the past day?
For the moment, no.
And the car is safely on its way to Argentina.
Bon voyage, old friend.
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.
Tomorrow, Again, again and again and again.
-It's a great movie.
- Yeah.
She's not your mother.
What's that about your mother?
Theo was just telling me that Lena's not my mother.
You didn't know that?
I told you, detective, my father dropped me off at the hotel.
I was alone.
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.
- I can't help it.
- Try.
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.
He was there with you.
He used three capital letters to sign for the drink.
WMP.
William McPherson.
Why do you hate me?
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.
That scene kills me every time.
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.
- WVB?
- Yeah.
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.
Makes sense, but we figured it came from him.
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl and she says Gil snitched for her in a possession case last yean
So she felt like she owed him a favor.
Gil gave her some story about the hold being trumped up.
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.
Check and see if Van Beber has any kids.
Nick, what the heck are you doing in there?
- I gotta go.
Just check.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?
You say you'll bring it back and I nod like a robot?
I'll take him.
Just let me get this.
Yo.
Detective Blades?
it's Rosalyn Wohl.
- Yes?
- Who is that?
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?
He says he'll give you the guy who's killing the people on the list.
All right.
Where?
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.
Just do what he says.
- What does Gil want?
- The list.
-Why?
- If he gets the list back his employer refrains from putting a bullet in his ear.
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.
You don't have the list.
Happy took it.
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?
You know all those bad people you sent to prison?
They ever call to say thanks?
No.
Sometimes I send people to prison for doing bad things.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people.
I appreciate that.
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?
Apparently his last wish is for you to precede him to the promised land.
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo.
Too dangerous.
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car.
Don't give me a gun.
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.
- You trust me?
- I trust you.
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.
- Yeah.
- Happy.
Blades.
If you're not too busy making doughnuts I could use some backup.
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?
Well, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?
- Gold, yes.
Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.
Let's go.
Now.
Come on.
You're staying with me.
Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
- Wonderful.
Hands on your head.
Hands.
Come on.
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?
I don't know.
Am I supposed to know?
Oh, shit.
Call 911 and stay with the car.
-911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.
I ran into your father, Gil.
- He's worried about you.
- My father?
That's funny.
That's really-- That's hilarious.
- where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.
Bullshit.
Give me the goddamn paper.
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.
And you don't really need it anyway.
Hands up on your head.
I'm really sorry about the way this ends, detective.
I had such a good time watching you in trial.
You were the happiest defendant I've ever seen.
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.
You know you were right.
About the list?
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.
You're not the first to say so, although you may be the last.
Thought that kidnapping thing sounded fishy.
I knew you'd respond to a lady in distress.
That's no way to treat an employee.
Independent contractor.
I thought I was doing you a favor though, killing Gold.
He wants to put you away.
Once you know him, his intentions are good.
That's very magnanimous.
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.
So, yeah, sad story all around.
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.
Police!
A few of my dad's friends.
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.
Oh, shit.
Blades.
You could have put my father away for life.
Instead you had to kill him?
- I'm sorry.
I was just doing my job.
- No compromises.
No deals.
Right?
Well, guess what.
No deal for you either.
Don't move.
Yeah, well, Wohl was her mother's maiden name.
Van Beber never married her.
I hate to admit it, Blades, but you're not a half-bad detective.
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath the next 85 years.
Are we still on for Whole Foods?
You bet.
Want a ride to work in the morning?
Sure.
How very gallant of you.
Thanks.
-It's tomorrow.
- Again.
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.
That is good.
- That's bad.
- That is bad.
Still going after my dad for adultery?
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.
It's a fantasy.
He never cheated on her.
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God.
More fantasy.
Does my mother have any actual evidence of this affair?
Her theory is that he takes his girl or girls to this hotel.
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I found the car.
If the Hawk was supposed to be on its way to Argentina why did it keep popping up over town?
Excellent question.
You wouldn't expect a thief to steal it then tool around.
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.
Except when driving the Hawk.
He would never take a mistress to a swank hotel.
He would park the car in a hotel garage if it meant keeping it off the street.
Yes!
What do you say?
I get a turn at the wheel of this beauty?
All right, you've earned it.
You just go very easy, okay?
She likes to be rewed a lot before she downshifts.
- Taser boy?
- Yes?
Relax.
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.
You have to convince 12 jurors, including at least a few females.
Yes.
Yes.
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?
Letting you drive!
Apologize to your father for me.
Dad, I am really, really sorry.
Is he dead?
He never stood a chance against the Hawk.
Who is he?
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.
I guess killing his daughter didn't endear us to him.
We got lucky.
I've never been lucky.
Thanks.
For what?
Keeping me alive.
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.
So speaking of you sending me to prison ...
We were?
Admittedly, I've had some lapses of judgment.
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses here and there.
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.
Thanks for showing me the forest and the grays.
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?
What am I gonna tell my dad?
Tell him how much you love him.
The rest is pretty much paint by numbers.
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.
Son.
Hey.
Dad.
What time is it?
I have some bad news.
What?
Where's mom?
Oh, no, no, no. it's okay.
Mom is fine.
She's fine.
Now, look, Theo.
I don't want you to overreact or anything but it appears as if the Hawk has been stolen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.
Me?
That oar meant everything in the world to you.
Everything?
No, no, no.
It's a fine automobile but you know what I always say:
it's just a car.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.
We interviewed a few jurors after the mistrial they seemed pretty unimpressed, so we walked away.
But the fact that you decided to dismiss the case doesn't mean Detective Blades is innocent.
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.
I understand you spent time with Detective Blades looking for your car, which you reported stolen?
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.
Looks like you and Detective Blades had quite an adventure.
Detective Blades was instrumental in uncovering a damaging leak that was in our office.
A leak which had already resulted in the death of an FBI informant.
That's very impressive.
Look you knew at the time that Detective Blades was on administrative leave and he had specific orders not to do any police work.
My mother hired him as a PI to look for the car.
Which your father had.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
I bet Detective Blades went out of his way not to mislead anyone about his status.
He never flipped his badge, right?
Never brandished his gun?
Never once in your presence identified himself as a police officer?
Technically, no.
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil.
How you been?
Move.
Move.
I said move.
First of all, A, I'm a cop.
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.
Doesn't it get itchy?
Sweaty?
The paper.
Even though your face is covered, I can tell, you need a hug.
- Back off.
- Come on.
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.
No love?
Really?
You coming?
- What did I do?
- How should I know?
You gonna pick that up?
Hurry, I gotta go to court.
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come on, man.
You can't lock me up for walking down the street.
Guy with the persuader pointed at my head?
I don't know that guy.
- What's in the paper?
- News.
Newspaper.
Wallet.
And the gun.
Okay, easy tiger.
What's with the paper?
This is a really unsatisfying conversation.
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?
Better than you.
He took my money.
And when you tell me what I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.
Off to dance with Lady Justice.
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.
I've always been lucky.
Hey.
What the hell?
Firearm.
Thank you, sir.
You're Lena Valoise.
I was.
Tomorrow, Again is one of my favorite movies.
Me too.
- Nick.
- How do you do?
Great.
What are you doing here?
I've come to see my son, the assistant DA.
Me too.
- You must be very proud.
- I must.
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.
- You look a little lost.
- I am.
Courtroom 3?
Come.
I'll show you.
We call it the thin blue line, the police.
The fragile barrier between the bad guys and you.
We give policemen like Detective Nick Blades guns.
We pay them well.
And all we ask in return is that they do what they swear they'll do.
Protect and serve.
But what happens if they break that promise?
What happens if one day you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys?
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold care to join us in this case?
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.
Anarchy.
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.
- Mr. Gold....
- You know what?
I still do.
I believe there is such a thing as right and wrong.
I believe in an irrepressible commitment to the truth.
An irreproachable moral and ethical code that cannot be compromised.
Detective Blades thought he could be the law, but not follow it.
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.
That's wrong.
Thank you.
We will adjourn for the day.
First time he called the police on me he was 9.
- What'd you do?
- I took away his legos.
Mr. Gold.
Your reaction to the DA's decision to retire?
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.
Do you have any comments on a frontrunner for the interim slot?
I've been dealing with police corruption.
It doesn't leave a lot of time to deal with office personnel matters.
Do you plan on attending Willie Van Beber's execution?
I did my job putting Willie Van Beber right where he belongs.
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner take it from there.
Excuse me.
You people don't mind if I borrow my son, the assistant DA, do you?
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.
You sure you don't have an announcement to make?
Your father is having an affair.
Would you and the good Lord care to comment on that?
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?
Every time you say Dad's having sex with someone else.
Go to the country house.
Where's the van?
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.
I thought we'd agree we only use the Hawk in an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1 :30.
Honey, this car represents the last fragile thread of dignity holding my family together.
Take my car.
Park in my spot.
Theo.
I thought on people's birthdays, other people are supposed to do what they want.
And I thought turning 40 meant not acting 7.
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch with the next DA.
Great.
And you'll still earn less than our gardener and I'll still be paying for lunch with my parents' credit card.
Jeez, Kelly, come on.
Don't do this.
Just give me today.
You're the one who wants to live in a house big enough for 12.
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.
I'm leaving.
I'm not done yet.
Leaving you.
Actually, you're the one leaving since my parents own the house.
I'll give you one week to get your things and get out.
Today you do this?
Today?
On my birthday?
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years I've wasted on someone going precisely nowhere?
Kelly, come on.
Wait a minute.
What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.
Really?
And how many hours do you spend with them on any given week?
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you three times what the DA's job pays.
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.
I believe in what I do.
Is that so wrong?
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?
Yeah?
Okay.
They want me back.
- Right away, sir.
- Good.
Because I don't.
I'm sorry.
Please remember to put the cover back on the Hawk.
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.
I've received the following note from the jurors.
"We have voted several times.
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.
Would you like to set the matter for retrial?
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
Blades?
I don't care what the jury did.
You're on leave until you deal with Internal Affairs.
Do you hear me?
Until I say so, you are not police.
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA, they're gonna rush out and get my name tattooed across their butt cheeks.
- Give me five.
- Nice going.
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?
Was in Interview 4, but Schaefer needed the room so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate?
I'm buying.
You're buying?
Or is Gil buying?
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.
He was carrying the paper the cash when I popped him.
Then some ape in a wool ski mask came at me with a piece.
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?
There's numbers and letters circled all over it.
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.
I tried to decipher it but Gold's closing was distracting.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
I'll go sit on Gil.
Blades strikes me as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.
He's dirty.
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.
Yes, exactly.
We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.
I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.
Trust cops to deal with cops?
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.
Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?
Turns out, it's mostly grays.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.
Am I supposed to see the forest or mostly grays?
Look, everything I know comes from you.
A much younger and stupider me.
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.
Good.
Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.
You're kidding?
Grant Stone?
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.
And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.
So do the judges.
Most of the defense bar.
I should start caring about defense lawyers?
Everybody in the system gets chewed up, Theo.
Including the poor bastards we send to prison.
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--
Theo.
Take some time off.
Go home.
Look in the mirror.
I need Gil Ott for an interview.
- Not here.
- Where is he?
Check again.
Detective Schaefer brought him earlier.
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want?
I just came on.
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.
What the crap?
Come on.
What's up with the sneak attack?
License, registration, proof of insurance.
I'm a DA.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
License.
My registration.
Have you had anything to drink tonight, Mr. Gould, is it?
It's Gold.
Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.
Mr. Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.
If you do not calm down, I will have to place you under arrest.
Are you joking?
What is all this about?
- Please step out of the car.
- No.
Mr. Gold, please step out of the vehicle now.
I am placing you under arrest.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.
- No, I'm not.
- You are definitely resisting arrest.
What are you talking about?
If you continue to resist arrest, I will Tase you.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.
Make the call.
Let's go 10-99.
Detective Nick Blades there's something shocking you should see, State and Chestnut.
Get the hell away from me.
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.
Just leave me alone.
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.
I've seen Tomorrow, Again like 50 times.
Please don't speak to me.
What happened?
Two policemen kidnapped and Tased me.
Friends of yours, I presume.
I've never been Tased myself.
Imagine the worst dental appointment of all time.
You got lucky, detective.
It won't happen again.
I've always been lucky.
Today's my birthday.
I hope it's the best one ever.
Kelly!
No, no.
Don't do this to me.
Kelly.
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead apparently, your precious Hawk is missing and you may remember, I'm going to my parents until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.
Just give me a little more time to explain to the kids.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys.
Daddy loves you.
See you soon.
This asshole must be having the worst day of his life.
He just called in to report that someone stole his car out of his driveway.
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?
You know what happens when you wake up in the morning and you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad?
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.
Anarchy.
And the Cubs win the World Series.
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.
We've done our share of fooling around over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.
It's time for him to hang up his sword and die with something approaching dignity.
Mom, I don't need to hear this.
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.
I thought it was the cancer, so I didn't push.
But now I know.
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.
What time are you picking us up for lunch?
Theo?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.
- So take the van.
- It's dead.
Again?
All right, you have my permission to use the Hawk, just be very careful.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What's wrong with the Hawk?
I don't believe this.
I gotta go.
If something happens to that automobile, it'll kill your father.
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.
Move out of the street.
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.
Please move out of the street or I'll have to cite you.
I'm bleeding here.
I'm bleeding here.
Move now.
My car was stolen.
I saw the guy driving it around the corner two minutes ago.
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh?
Shocking.
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.
I don't see anything.
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.
You know, I'm about to go off shift if you want a ride downtown.
Thank you.
Okay, Blades, so now you're buying two dinners.
And not the Whole Foods deli again, either.
Someplace where they bring food to the table.
Let's see what you got, then we'll decide.
Well, it was code.
Forensics figures it for driver's license numbers.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep.
And it's four local Louisiana plates.
It's just that there are three extra letters.
WVB or BVW, depending on how you read it.
But one of the cars is registered to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.
If we have the list and Gil's in jail, how does the car get stolen?
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.
Check with Schaefer and Chin.
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses on my way to Gil's.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
Blades.
Goddamn it.
If you're out there impersonating a police officer, I will pinch you myself.
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.
In the meantime, I'm having my teeth cleaned and maybe a trim.
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.
So as soon as we can unplug an officer from another matter, we'll be with you.
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor and tell him to come out here now.
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
I understand that my reputation precedes me.
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour my car was stolen, and I just want a little help.
That's all.
Despite the fact you've been trying to put one of my best cops in jail I find this conversation scintillating.
You, in fact, may describe it as electrifying.
- How you doing?
- Good.
I'm detective Nick Blades, New Orleans police.
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.
- Your parents home?
- No.
- They at work?
- No.
- I give up.
Where are they?
- Dead.
My grandma says that if she was on the jury she'd vote to send you to jail.
I guess I'm glad your grandma's not on the jury.
My grandma says you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am.
Your grandma take care of you?
- Yeah.
- Is she home?
No.
Is that your grandma's car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?
- Yeah.
- Is he home?
- No.
- Where's he?
- Jail.
Does he get out soon?
My grandma said it depends if his jury is as dumb as yours.
Tell your grandma to lock the car up tight.
All right.
- Hand over the money already.
- It's not like it's because you got nothing.
Yeah, well.
It's okay, guys.
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot?
He just said that.
Never heard of you.
Let's see it.
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.
Enjoy.
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know.
Ask him.
What you want with Gil?
Where is the little creep?
After he robbed 400 off me, he didn't leave no forwarding address.
- You see him with this guy?
- No.
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?
All I know is, last time I saw him, he was okay.
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.
I chose Olive Garden.
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?
Thank you.
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.
I also took that off Gil.
Call 911.
Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.
I'm sure they'll find it.
But with my luck, somebody will probably have peed in it.
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.
Well, also in the meantime my wife is taking away my kids, my car was stolen and because of Blades, I'm getting no help from the cops.
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.
I should have listened.
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.
That's much better than rotting teeth.
You mentioned the Van Beber case.
Here's the murder book.
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.
And everyone was mad at me for not dealing.
The judge was mad at me for ruining his summer vacation.
The boss didn't want me tied up for three months.
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.
Plead it.
Settle it.
Compromise.
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.
Grab that, will you?
- Hello?
- Kelly you get your husband on the phone right now.
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger about our problems like it's CNN.
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly he insisted we come to your house.
When you weren't here, he got very upset and locked himself...
- ...in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?
Apparently.
He must've had it in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears...
- ...
like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.
You can buy guns in vending machines now.
- Call the cops.
- No.
I will not have some SWAT team blasting through the door scaring your father to death.
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I gotta go.
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.
Where'd you get those tickets?
Kinko's?
Nice pants.
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?
He's been threatening to kill himself for the last 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.
Herb, I want the truth.
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.
Along with everything else, he's cheating.
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?
Herb.
What did you do?
- Wait.
- Marty.
Holy moly.
Put down the gun.
- Oh, Lord.
Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.
He's not well, Nick.
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky.
He won't shoot Marty.
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.
You need a haircut.
I said I'd stay with him in sickness and in health.
Now he's sick and I'm staying.
But I can't abide the cheating.
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.
Just follow him.
I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?
I heard about your son's car being stolen, thought I could help.
What car?
- Oh, my God.
The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.
Detective Blades happened to stop by and everything's under control.
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.
He's agreed to help find the car.
And the other matter?
Forget the other matter for the moment.
You and Theo find the Hawk.
I'll do everything I can to keep this from your father.
I'll expect regular reports.
- She wants reports.
- I heard.
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.
This is a very comfortable mattress.
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.
Kelly bought it.
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?
Same reason everybody buys one.
It's a crazy world out there, son.
And I got like 30 percent off.
Don't you tell your mother.
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.
Am I dreaming this or is your Uncle Marty here?
Uncle Marty?
Of course, he had to leave.
Took my gun.
I think that's probably for the best.
Theo, your mother has to try this mattress.
I mean, it is incredible.
You should try it.
Come on.
Try it.
Come on.
Yeah.
So?
It is.
It's a great mattress.
It is sublime is what it is.
Yeah.
It's nice.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck.
Monday, on a ship.
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.
Trust me, you're not getting any play from the department.
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.
You get your way, I'm gonna need all the money I can scrape together.
I'm not dropping the charges, even if you do find the car.
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.
- You know him?
- How would I know him?
Gil was carrying a newspaper with plates numbers written in code on it.
Your plate number was on the list.
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye on the Hawk.
It's a very nice car.
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.
I wasted every weekend of my childhood working on that damn car.
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.
I get it.
So, what do we do?
We go see Ott, you slap him around a little he tells us where my car is?
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court, so I had to park him.
While you were blasting me in front of the jury, he slipped.
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.
But I'll assume that he delivered a copy of the list once he got out.
So how do we find my car?
How should I know?
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.
Although, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.
Don't do that.
What--?
What--?
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?
I'm a lawyer.
My mind is my weapon.
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me long before I find your car.
Come on.
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.
Why are we here?
Come on, let's go.
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.
Gentlemen, we honor the master and the practice by bowing when we enter the dojo.
We're police.
You Edward Mackie?
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.
Are you insane?
Ever see that scene in Indiana jones where he watches some guy with a big sword do his thing and then shoots him?
In this situation, I'm Indy.
Move.
Now.
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--
Move.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Theodore, put thing down before you kill someone.
Hey.
Hey, give me a break.
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?
It's already in the book.
Thanks for everything.
That's why those people are so widely despised.
There's no give and take.
No compromise.
What does any of this have to do with my car?
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.
In prison, he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect, looking for Gil at his father's place.
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names before I do more good deeds.
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning.
He's in jail.
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?
The boy's running so he must have burned somebody.
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.
I seem to recall something about my mother paying you to find my car?
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?
Possibly.
There seems to be a connection between gangs and the list.
Before I was chief assistant, I did head up the gang prosecution unit.
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?
- Really.
- Isn't he about to be executed?
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on, move, move.
- You, too.
- Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.
No, thanks.
You're like a walking cliché.
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.
Brother Blades.
So nice to see you.
Happy, this is my partner, Roberto Clemente.
The sainted ballplayer.
It's my honor.
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott and he ends up locked up.
You know anything about that?
I heard some old guys kicked the shit out him.
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.
Give me six maple, two glazed, and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.
And I'll need the paper back when you're done reading it.
It's like warm maple syrup being poured over your tongue.
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.
Why do they never see that coming?
What a waste of 50 grand.
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.
That one on the list?
Yep.
It's mine.
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.
Yeah.
I'll make sure to use my Club.
That was my guy yesterday, outside the bar.
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.
Why a wool mask in July?
I was hoping to grab Gil before he delivered the paper.
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.
No, the paper wasn't for me.
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily bad reputation, Blades.
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor convicts on the four yard at Angola.
I was one of them.
It was a social club.
I understand you've since diversified considerably.
And like all other complex organizations, we have our internal differences.
The newspaper was a delivery from Willie Van Beber to a pro hitter, identity unknown.
You know who Van Beber is?
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.
He's running out of time.
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?
I believe I do.
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.
I need Gil because he's the one that can ID the person out on the street taking orders from Van Beber.
- Still with me?
- Yeah.
If you hadn't popped Gil, I'd have his contact and it would be over.
I'm genuinely sorry.
I had no idea my nose was in your business.
- Yeah.
These things happen.
- So where's Ed?
Ed's dead.
Or will be shortly.
And you better keep your eye on your little pal Roberto the DA because if he's not on the list, he will be.
You know he's the one that put Willie down.
He's on the list.
Like I said, find Gil.
Get his contact, take him off the street, or feed him to me.
Then, hopefully, Van Beber will go to his great reward and I'll get back to my goddamn doughnuts.
- Blades.
- It's not cars.
It's bodies.
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
I mind.
You're putting my life at risk and those of everyone around you.
Idiot!
Hey, I'm back.
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?
How many non-Whole Foods dinners am I up to?
I'm going to prison soon.
Two of out of the three have federal jackets.
Happy Conners is a snitch?
That's hard to believe.
Negative.
It's Ed Mackie and Dean Nickerson are the informants.
- Which agency?
- FBI.
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy named Willie Van Beber.
Know him?
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.
Very soon.
This is his last hurrah.
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber the names of the informants.
Who has access to the FBI informant database?
Anyone senior in this department or in any other in the region, state or federal.
Why is Gold on the list though?
I'm sure there's more than a few who wanna smoke Gold.
I expect it's because he put Van Beber on death row.
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?
No, we put this out there, our leaky cop evaporates.
True.
Glass finds out I'm working this, he'll have a coronary.
I don't need that.
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?
- Come on!
What are you doing?
- No.
Come on!
Dude!
You coming?
Five-0 in the house.
Was that really necessary?
I keep my love of food and my professional life separate.
- Fatty.
- Blades.
Give me a slab to go with the sauce on the side.
I heard you paid off that jury.
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.
Along with my order, I'll need an address on Gil Ott.
I don't know no Gil.
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.
And I do know me a Bill.
Theodore, assume for a moment most of the people in this place are on parole, probation or otherwise in the system.
How long would it take for me to find out one of them is in possession of a gun resulting in their immediate and protracted incarceration?
You ain't even no police.
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Feel free to call me any time within the next five minutes.
Yeah.
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.
Most importantly, what does any of it have to do with finding my car?
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.
Talk to me.
Thanks, Fatty.
I owe you.
Hey.
You can't just go and do whatever you want in life, Blades.
There are systems and rules.
These systems and rules exist for a reason.
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.
And not once have you just cut a corner, just bent a little.
You know what the United States Supreme Court says?
United States Supreme Court says a prosecutor is a representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy.
No, sir.
As a prosecutor, I am the representative of our sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective my solemn obligation is not to win cases, but to do justice.
I make one wrong move, I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.
It's very tiring to be around you.
You just bought a slab of ribs.
You kidding me?
The last time I ate at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.
This place rocks.
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?
I'm feeling really lost.
Can you try and explain to me what's happening?
Your car look anything like that?
That's it.
I don't believe this.
That's it.
That's my car.
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.
Give me the keys.
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear on how important that car is to my father.
To me.
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
- It's not.
I need to find that car, Blades.
My family is gone, my career is shit, my mother's insane and my father's dying.
The one thing I got half a chance of doing is finding that car.
And if you can't or won't help me, then goddamn it, I will do it myself.
Get off.
Get off.
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.
Hello?
I'm kidnapped.
Here, here.
This is why this country's going in the toilet.
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.
I just saw him.
Called from the trunk of his car after you told me about the list.
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk?
What happened?
A pro, for sure.
You were right about Mackie, he was working for us.
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.
Mackie would have put him down forever.
I was actually figuring Happy for the body.
I don't think so.
Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.
- You know Willie Van Beber?
- 4-4 number-one shot caller?
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.
Van Beber's settling up before he gets executed.
They wanna kill each other, it's fine with me.
Start smoking my informants, I get annoyed.
I mean, Mackie means we lose two ongoing investigations.
He made the list for putting Van Beber on the row.
- How nice.
Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.
After you get your delivery boy, plug the damn leak.
We're not even looking for my car.
I doubt we ever were.
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?
These things take time.
Have faith.
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.
I don't understand.
Why are we waiting?
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we just go in and get Gil Ott now?
Fools rush in, my friend.
I hate golf.
Other than working on the Hawk, this was the one thing my father and I did together.
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs around people's necks.
You just have to relax.
How?
Before you swing, breathe.
Okay, time's up.
I'll go get him.
If Gil Ott's in there, you think my car is nearby?
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
Until about two seconds ago, pretty good.
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?
- Out where?
- Jail.
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead.
Okay?
Paper had the name of 4-4's, two of which were federal snitches.
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
It also had the name of a DA named Theo Gold, who also happens to be a friend.
You get the needle for whacking a DA.
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.
You're the only one who can ID the source which is why I assume you're whacked out in this caddy shack shit hole.
That's just rude.
I live here.
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.
Everybody wants you, Gil.
Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
Sit down.
I need your contact.
One name.
Give me that name and maybe I'll let you live so you can remodel.
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.
Back inside.
Now!
You want me to go after them or get those off you?
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.
Did you ask about the car?
I forgot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Nothing nine Band-Aids and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.
I did predict you'd shoot me.
I remember.
I decided I wanted to live more than I want my car.
My father will understand that.
I'll take you home.
Just drop me off at my parents'.
I'll break the news.
I can already see his face.
God, I'd do anything to avoid that slightly disappointed but not altogether surprised look.
You know the look?
Please.
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old daughter I see one weekend a month.
I know the look.
Theo, go get him before one of the neighbors calls the police.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- What are you doing?
Call you in a bit.
I can't tell whether I'm being guarded or surveilled.
Your little redheaded co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really?
Why?
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on.
That's ridiculous.
She can go to any private firm in this city and make five times what she's making.
She doesn't need to sell informant data for money, okay?
- You want me to call her?
Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore.
Maybe later.
My mother wants you to come in for my belated birthday dinner.
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?
Can you do the entire Valoise family a favor and just stay off the subject?
Please?
Did you know that Robert Evans was our neighbor for a while in California?
Of course, that was before he became huge.
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.
Apparently not so incredible that he cast me in anything.
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.
Sonny and Cher.
Bobby Redford.
Bobby had a terrible overbite.
Tell me again.
Who are you?
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.
That is very interesting.
Your son's a great lawyer.
We would have preferred if he had gone into dentistry but you give them wings, they fly away.
You know how it is, Marty.
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.
That was before anyone told me about his, you know, style.
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it?
Thank you.
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.
I used to think I had one.
Now I realize I burned it down without even knowing.
Homes get rebuilt.
All I wanted was to spend whatever time my dad has left driving around with him in the Hawk.
- Pulling plugs.
You know?
- And sending me to prison.
I figured this is the time to be a good son.
After, I'd try to be a better husband and father.
Tell me about your daughter.
She lives with her mom.
All the money I skimmed from the detective busts went toward her school.
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.
I feel horrible about it.
You expect me to drop the case because you have the same problems that everybody else does.
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.
People get divorced and pay for braces all the time...
- ...without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.
They lack opportunity.
Maybe.
I mean, my wife's family has money.
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.
You still can't tell me what we've been doing for the past day?
For the moment, no.
And the car is safely on its way to Argentina.
Bon voyage, old friend.
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.
Tomorrow, Again, again and again and again.
- It's a great movie.
- Yeah.
She's not your mother.
What's that about your mother?
Theo was just telling me that Lena's not my mother.
You didn't know that?
I told you, detective, my father dropped me off at the hotel.
I was alone.
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.
- I can't help it.
- Try.
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.
He was there with you.
He used three capital letters to sign for the drink.
WMP.
William McPherson.
Why do you hate me?
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.
That scene kills me every time.
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.
- WVB?
- Yeah.
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.
Makes sense, but we figured it came from him.
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl and she says Gil snitched for her in a possession case last year.
So she felt like she owed him a favor.
Gil gave her some story about the hold being trumped up.
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.
Check and see if Van Beber has any kids.
Nick, what the heck are you doing in there?
- I gotta go.
Just check.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?
You say you'll bring it back and I nod like a robot?
I'll take him.
Just let me get this.
Yo.
Detective Blades?
It's Rosalyn Wohl.
- Yes?
- Who is that?
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?
He says he'll give you the guy who's killing the people on the list.
All right.
Where?
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.
Just do what he says.
- What does Gil want?
- The list.
- Why?
- If he gets the list back his employer refrains from putting a bullet in his ear.
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.
You don't have the list.
Happy took it.
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?
You know all those bad people you sent to prison?
They ever call to say thanks?
No.
Sometimes I send people to prison for doing bad things.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people.
I appreciate that.
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?
Apparently his last wish is for you to precede him to the promised land.
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo.
Too dangerous.
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car.
Don't give me a gun.
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.
- You trust me?
- I trust you.
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.
- Yeah.
- Happy.
Blades.
If you're not too busy making doughnuts I could use some backup.
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?
Well, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?
- Gold, yes.
Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.
Let's go.
Now.
Come on.
You're staying with me.
Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
- Wonderful.
Hands on your head.
Hands.
Come on.
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?
I don't know.
Am I supposed to know?
Oh, shit.
Call 911 and stay with the car.
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.
I ran into your father, Gil.
- He's worried about you.
- My father?
That's funny.
That's really-- That's hilarious.
- Where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.
Bullshit.
Give me the goddamn paper.
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.
And you don't really need it anyway.
Hands up on your head.
I'm really sorry about the way this ends, detective.
I had such a good time watching you in trial.
You were the happiest defendant I've ever seen.
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.
You know you were right.
About the list?
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.
You're not the first to say so, although you may be the last.
Thought that kidnapping thing sounded fishy.
I knew you'd respond to a lady in distress.
That's no way to treat an employee.
Independent contractor.
I thought I was doing you a favor though, killing Gold.
He wants to put you away.
Once you know him, his intentions are good.
That's very magnanimous.
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.
So, yeah, sad story all around.
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.
Police!
A few of my dad's friends.
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.
Oh, shit.
Blades.
You could have put my father away for life.
Instead you had to kill him?
- I'm sorry.
I was just doing my job.
- No compromises.
No deals.
Right?
Well, guess what.
No deal for you either.
Don't move.
Yeah, well, Wohl was her mother's maiden name.
Van Beber never married her.
I hate to admit it, Blades, but you're not a half-bad detective.
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath the next 85 years.
Are we still on for Whole Foods?
You bet.
Want a ride to work in the morning?
Sure.
How very gallant of you.
Thanks.
- It's tomorrow.
- Again.
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.
That is good.
- That's bad.
- That is bad.
Still going after my dad for adultery?
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.
It's a fantasy.
He never cheated on her.
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God.
More fantasy.
Does my mother have any actual evidence of this affair?
Her theory is that he takes his girl or girls to this hotel.
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I found the car.
If the Hawk was supposed to be on its way to Argentina why did it keep popping up over town?
Excellent question.
You wouldn't expect a thief to steal it then tool around.
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.
Except when driving the Hawk.
He would never take a mistress to a swank hotel.
He would park the car in a hotel garage if it meant keeping it off the street.
Yes!
What do you say?
I get a turn at the wheel of this beauty?
All right, you've earned it.
You just go very easy, okay?
She likes to be rewed a lot before she downshifts.
- Taser boy?
- Yes?
Relax.
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.
You have to convince 12 jurors, including at least a few females.
Yes.
Yes.
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?
Letting you drive!
Apologize to your father for me.
Dad, I am really, really sorry.
Is he dead?
He never stood a chance against the Hawk.
Who is he?
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.
I guess killing his daughter didn't endear us to him.
We got lucky.
I've never been lucky.
Thanks.
For what?
Keeping me alive.
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.
So speaking of you sending me to prison....
We were?
Admittedly, I've had some lapses of judgment.
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses here and there.
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.
Thanks for showing me the forest and the grays.
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?
What am I gonna tell my dad?
Tell him how much you love him.
The rest is pretty much paint by numbers.
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.
Son.
Hey.
Dad.
What time is it?
I have some bad news.
What?
Where's mom?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay.
Mom is fine.
She's fine.
Now, look, Theo.
I don't want you to overreact or anything but it appears as if the Hawk has been stolen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.
Me?
That car meant everything in the world to you.
Everything?
No, no, no.
It's a fine automobile but you know what I always say:
It's just a car.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.
We interviewed a few jurors after the mistrial they seemed pretty unimpressed, so we walked away.
But the fact that you decided to dismiss the case doesn't mean Detective Blades is innocent.
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.
I understand you spent time with Detective Blades looking for your car, which you reported stolen?
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.
Looks like you and Detective Blades had quite an adventure.
Detective Blades was instrumental in uncovering a damaging leak that was in our office.
A leak which had already resulted in the death of an FBI informant.
That's very impressive.
Look you knew at the time that Detective Blades was on administrative leave and he had specific orders not to do any police work.
My mother hired him as a Pl to look for the car.
Which your father had.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
I bet Detective Blades went out of his way not to mislead anyone about his status.
He never flipped his badge, right?
Never brandished his gun?
Never once in your presence identified himself as a police officer?
Technically, no.
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
My head.
- Hey, Nick.
- Gil.
How you been?
Move.
Move.
I said move.
First of all, A, I'm a cop.
B, we're in New Orleans and it's July.
Doesn't it get itchy?
Sweaty?
The paper.
Even though your face is covered, I can tell, you need a hug.
- Back off.
- Come on.
- Come to papa.
- You crazy.
- Give it up.
- You're crazy, man.
No love?
Really?
You coming?
- What did I do?
- How should I know?
You gonna pick that up?
Hurry, I gotta go to court.
I will not run in this heat, Gil.
Now you owe me a bullet.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Come on, man.
You can't look me up for walking down the street.
Guy with the persuader pointed at my head?
I don't know that guy.
- What's in the paper?
- News.
Newspaper.
Wallet.
And the gun.
Okay, easy tiger.
What's with the paper?
This is a really unsatisfying conversation.
- Put him someplace uncomfortable.
- How you doing?
Better than you.
He took my money.
And when you tell me what I'm arresting you for, you'll get it back.
Off to dance with Lady Justice.
Luckily, she hasn't known you very long.
Go.
I've always been lucky.
Hey.
What the hell?
Firearm.
Thank you, sir.
You're Lena Valoise.
I was.
Tomorrow, Again is one of my favorite movies.
Me too.
- Nick.
- How do you do?
Great.
What are you doing here?
I've come to see my son, the assistant DA.
Me too.
- You must be very proud.
- I must.
- They'll let you in dressed like that?
- I'm hoping.
- You look a little lost.
- I am.
Courtroom 3?
Come.
I'll show you.
We call it the thin blue line, the police.
The fragile barrier between the bad guys and you.
We give policemen like Detective Nick Blades guns.
We pay them well.
And all we ask in return is that they do what they swear they'll do.
Protect and serve.
But what happens if they break that promise?
What happens if one day you can't tell the good guys from the bad guys?
Your Honor, would Mr. Gold care to join us in this case?
- Counsel?
- Chaos, my friends.
Anarchy.
The very wardrobe he so disrespectfully wears in this courtroom is emblematic of the point.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
When I was a kid, I believed in Batman and Superman.
- Mr. Gold ...
- You know what?
I still do.
I believe there is such a thing as right and wrong.
I believe in an irrepressible commitment to the truth.
An irreproachable moral and ethical code that cannot be compromised.
Detective Blades thought he could be the law, but not follow it.
That's not right, ladies and gentlemen.
That's wrong.
Thank you.
We will adjourn for the day.
First time he called the police on me he was 9.
- What'd you do?
- I took away his LEG-Os.
Mr. Gold.
Your reaction to the DA's decision to retire?
Clark Gunn has had a brilliant career.
I'll miss him.
Do you have any comments on a frontrunner for the interim slot?
I've been dealing with police corruption.
It doesn't leave a lot of time to deal with office personnel matters.
Do you plan on attending Willie Van Beber's execution?
I did my job, ...putting Willie Van Beber right where he belongs.
I'll let the good Lord and his executioner take it from there.
Excuse me.
You people don't mind if I borrow my son, the assistant DA, do you?
- I won't keep him long.
- Mom.
You sure you don't have an announcement to make?
Your father is having an affair.
Would you and the good Lord care to comment on that?
- I do not have time for this.
- What do you mean?
Every time you say Dad's having sex with someone else.
Go to the country house.
Where's the van?
It's dead.
You were gonna replace the battery.
I thought we'd agree we only use the Hawk in an emergency.
This is an emergency.
Hurry.
I have a facial and massage at 1:30.
Honey, this car represents the last fragile thread of dignity holding my family together.
Take my car.
Park in my spot.
Theo.
I thought on people's birthdays, other people are supposed to do what they want.
And I thought turning 40 meant not acting 7.
I'm pretty sure that you are having lunch with the next DA.
Great.
And you'll still earn less than our gardener and I'll still be paying for lunch with my parents' credit card.
Jeez, Kelly, come on.
Don't do this.
Just give me today.
You're the one who wants to live in a house big enough for 12.
You're the one who has the spa thing.
Not me.
I'm leaving.
I'm not done yet.
Leaving you.
Actually, you're the one leaving since my parents own the house.
I'll give you one week to get your things and get out.
Today you do this?
Today?
On my birthday?
- The biggest day of my career?
- What about the 15 years I've wasted on someone going precisely nowhere?
Kelly, come on.
Wait a minute.
What about the kids?
I can't live without my kids.
Really?
And how many hours do you spend with them on any given week?
- Two?
- Everything I do is because of them.
Finkle, Harbin, and Klotz offered you three times what the DA's job pays.
- And you turned it down.
- Money isn't everything.
I believe in what I do.
Is that so wrong?
And I believe in private school.
Is that so wrong?
Yeah?
Okay.
They want me back.
- Right away, sir.
- Good.
Because I don't.
I'm sorry.
Please remember to put the cover back on the Hawk.
- Good nap, counsel?
- Sorry.
I've received the following note from the jurors.
"We have voted several times.
We are split 6-6 as to all counts.
We want to go home."
- They've only been out a couple of hours.
- Mr. Gold, sit.
The jury is deadlocked.
I declare a mistrial.
Would you like to set the matter for retrial?
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
Blades?
I don't care what the jury did.
You're on leave until you deal with Internal Affairs.
Do you hear me?
Until I say so, you are not police.
Trust me, LT, when I'm through with IA, they're gonna rush out and get my name tattooed across their butt cheeks.
- Give me five.
- Nice going.
- Hey, way to go.
- Good job.
- Congrats.
- Where's Gil Ott?
Was in Interview 4, but Schaefer needed the room so he took him over to the jail.
Want me to go get him?
No, I'll go.
Dinner to celebrate?
I'm buying.
You're buying?
Or is Gil buying?
Technically, yeah, Gil's buying.
He was carrying the paper the cash when I popped him.
Then some ape in a wool ski mask came at me with a piece.
- He wanted this.
- Gil's delivering newspapers now?
There's numbers and letters circled all over it.
Can you get Forensics to look at it?
It's some kind of code.
I tried to decipher it but Gold's closing was distracting.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll check it out.
I'll go sit on Gil.
Blades strikes me as a pretty unimpressive bad guy.
He's dirty.
So he skimmed a few bucks.
He got drunk and over did it in a bar.
Yes, exactly.
We used to call that felony larceny and assault with a deadly weapon.
I understand Internal Affairs is going to water board him next week.
Trust cops to deal with cops?
- Just give it some thought.
- We're retrying it.
Wouldn't it be nice if life was all blacks and whites?
Turns out, it's mostly grays.
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- I'm just trying to get you to see the forest.
Okay, I'm drowning in metaphors here.
Am I supposed to see the forest or mostly grays?
Look, everything I know comes from you.
A much younger and stupider me.
- Are you happy doing this?
- I'm extremely happy.
Good.
Grant Stone's gonna get the interim appointment as the DA.
You're kidding?
Grant Stone?
- You're a great trial lawyer.
- I'm the senior deputy.
And everyone in the office thinks you're an asshole.
So do the judges.
Most of the defense bar.
I should start caring about defense lawyers?
Everybody in the system gets chewed up, Theo.
Including the poor bastards we send to prison.
Grant Stone cares about the bad guys.
That makes him more qualified than me--
Theo.
Take some time off.
Go home.
Look in the mirror.
I need Gil Ott for an interview.
- Not here.
- Where is he?
Check again.
Detective Schaefer brought him earlier.
- Come see for yourself.
- I had a hold on the guy.
The computer says the man isn't here.
What do you want?
I just came on.
- Who was here earlier?
- Chin.
- Where'd Chin go?
- Chin and me ain't that close.
What the crap?
Come on.
What's up with the sneak attack?
License, registration, proof of insurance.
I'm a DA.
License, registration, proof of insurance.
License.
My registration.
Have you had anything to drink tonight, Mr. Gould, is it?
It's Gold.
Theo Gold.
I'm chief assistant district attorney.
I was in my office all night working.
I'd appreciate you telling me what I did.
- Have you had anything to drink tonight?
- No.
Mn Gold, you're becoming upset.
Please calm down.
If you do not calm down, I will have to place you under arrest.
Are you joking?
What is all this about?
- Please step out of the can
- No.
Mr. Gold, please step out of the vehicle now.
I am placing you under arrest.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Mr. Gold, you are resisting arrest.
- No, I'm not.
- You are derfinitely resisting arrest.
What are you talking about?
If you continue to resist arrest, I will Tase you.
Are you out of your freaking mind?
- Should I go again?
- Said Tase him, not barbecue him.
Make the call.
Let's go 10-99.
Detective Nick Blades there's something shocking you should see, State and Chestnut.
Get the hell away from me.
- Mr. Gold, stop.
- Get the hell off of me.
- Then stop swinging at me.
- Fine.
Just leave me alone.
I can't believe your mom's Lena Valoise.
I've seen Tomorrow, Again like 50 times.
Please don't speak to me.
What happened?
Two policemen kidnapped and Tased me.
Friends of yours, I presume.
I've never been Tased myself.
Imagine the worst dental appointment of all time.
You got lucky, detective.
It won't happen again.
I've always been lucky.
Today's my birthday.
I hope it's the best one ever.
Kelly!
No, no.
Don't do this to me.
Kelly.
- Where's the Hawk?
- I have no idea.
- You know what time it is?
- Hawk's not in the driveway.
Give me the keys to your car.
The keys!
- Why?
- Because that minivan is dead apparently, your precious Hawk is missing and you may remember, I'm going to my parents until you get the hell out of my house.
That's why.
Come on, Kelly, I'm begging.
Just give me a little more time to explain to the kids.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye, guys.
Daddy loves you.
See you soon.
This asshole must be having the worst day of his life.
He just called in to report that someone stole his car out of his driveway.
Stop, now you're just trying to hurt me.
- Where's it at?
- How should I know?
Wait, you don't think we stole his car?
You know what happens when you wake up in the morning and you can't tell the difference between good guys and bad?
- Where's the car?
- Chaos, detective.
Anarchy.
And the Cubs win the World Series.
I'm telling you, Blades, the report is legit.
We didn't do it.
Yeah?
- What are you gonna do about your father?
- Nothing.
We've done our share of fooling around over the years, Theo, but this is ridiculous.
It's time for him to hang up his sword and die with something approaching dignity.
Mom, I don't need to hear this.
The worst part is he's lost interest in me.
I thought it was the cancer, so I didn't push.
But now I know.
- I still have needs, Theo.
- Please, stop, enough already.
What time are you picking us up for lunch?
Theo?
I'm sorry, I have to cancel.
Kelly has my car.
- So take the van.
-It's dead.
Again?
All right, you have my permission to use the Hawk, just be very careful.
- I can't.
- Why not?
What's wrong with the Hawk?
I don't believe this.
I gotta go.
If something happens to that automobile, it'll kill your father.
- I'm hanging up the phone now.
- And I don't mean that metaphorically.
Move out of the street.
I just had an accident.
I think I may have broken something.
Please move out of the street or I'll have to cite you.
I'm bleeding here.
I'm bleeding here.
Move now.
My car was stolen.
I saw the guy driving it around the corner two minutes ago.
- I tried to go after him on the bike.
- Stolen, huh?
Shocking.
Drive around the block, you might find him.
It's a 1957 Studebaker Golden Hawk.
I don't see anything.
- You're gonna have to call in a report.
- I did.
You know, I'm about to go off shift if you want a ride downtown.
Thank you.
Okay, Blades, so now you're buying two dinners.
And not the whole Foods deli again, either.
Someplace where they bring food to the table.
Let's see what you got, then we'll decide.
Well, it was code.
Forensics figures it for driver's license numbers.
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
- Did you run the registrations?
- Yep.
And it's four local Louisiana plates.
It's just that there are three extra letters.
WVB or BVW, depending on how you read it.
But one of the cars is registered to YouTube's latest sensation, Taser Boy.
Theo Gold?
He reported his car stolen this morning.
- So, what is this, a shopping list?
- Gold must have a pretty nice car.
If we have the list and Gil's in jail, how does the oar get stolen?
- Jail has no record of him being there.
- That's impossible.
- I saw Schaefer walk him out the door.
- I'm gonna go hunt down Gil.
- You want me to call Gold?
- Let me deal with that.
Check with Schaefer and Chin.
I'm gonna stop by a couple of addresses on my way to Gil's.
Okay.
Hi, Nick.
Blades.
Goddamn it.
If you're out there impersonating a police officer, I will pinch you myself.
- You got IA in 48 hours.
- I'm looking forward to it.
In the meantime, I'm having my teeth cleaned and maybe a trim.
- I've been waiting over an hour.
- I understand you've had a jolt, Mr. Gold.
There's no need to get all charged up.
We're having a busy morning here.
So as soon as we can unplug an officer from another matter, we'll be with you.
Sergeant Rand, call your supervisor and tell him to come out here now.
Lieutenant, Mr. Gold currently needs to see you.
Thank you, sir.
Yes?
I understand that my reputation precedes me.
I'll live with the abuse, okay?
But I'm here over an hour my car was stolen, and I just want a little help.
That's all.
Despite the fact you've been trying to put one of my best cops in jail I find this conversation scintillating.
You, in fact, may describe it as electrifying.
- How you doing?
- Good.
I'm detective Nick Blades, New Orleans police.
- You're the one on TV.
- That's me.
- Your parents home?
- No.
- They at work?
- No.
- I give up.
Where are they?
- Dead.
My grandma says that if she was on the jury she'd vote to send you to jail.
I guess I'm glad your grandma's not on the jury.
My grandma says you should be ashamed of yourself.
I am.
Your grandma take care of you?
- Yeah.
- Is she home?
No.
Is that your grandma's car in the driveway?
- Yeah.
- Then who's Dean Nickerson?
- My brother.
- So he owns the car?
- Yeah.
- Is he home?
- No.
- Where's he?
- Jail.
Does he get out soon?
My grandma said it depends if his jury is as dumb as yours.
Tell your grandma to lock the car up tight.
All right.
- Hand over the money already.
-It's not like it's because you got nothing.
Yeah, well.
It's okay, guys.
- Who might you be?
- Detective Nick Blades.
- Police?
- What are you, an idiot?
He just said that.
Never heard of you.
Let 's see it.
Settle down, guys.
I think he's had enough.
Enjoy.
- You looking for Gil?
- Yeah.
- What'd the creep do this time?
- I don't know.
Ask him.
What you want with Gil?
Where is the little creep?
After he robbed 400 off me, he didn't leave no forwarding address.
- You see him with this guy?
- No.
- What's the boy into these days?
- You think he tells me?
All I know is, last time I saw him, he was okay.
- He even asked me to dinner.
- He took you to Olive Garden.
I chose Olive Garden.
Can you hand me my badge, please, sir?
Thank you.
- I ain't no charity case.
- I took it off Gil.
I also took that off Gil.
Call 911.
Or shoot him.
Either way, I wasn't here.
- Hey, Rosalyn.
- I heard.
I'm sure they'll find it.
But with my luck, somebody will probably have peed in it.
- I'm confused.
- What'd you hear?
- Grant Stone, the interim appointee.
- Yeah.
Well, also in the meantime my wife is taking away my kids, my car was stolen and because of Blades, I'm getting no help from the cops.
- That sucks.
- Yes, indeed, it does.
My dad wanted me to be a dentist.
I should have listened.
- My father wants me to be a DA.
- He's a wise man, your father.
That's much better than rotting teeth.
You mentioned the Van Beber case.
Here's the murder book.
The whole story.
Man, I had that guy cold.
And everyone was mad at me for not dealing.
The judge was mad at me for ruining his summer vacation.
The boss didn't want me tied up for three months.
Even the jurors hated me.
Everyone kept saying the same thing.
Plead it.
Settle it.
Compromise.
Well, in one week, Willie Van Beber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.
Grab that, will you?
- Hello?
- Kelly you get your husband on the phone right now.
- His father's finally gone over the edge.
- This isn't Kelly.
- Who the hell is this?
- You need to grab this now.
- Yeah.
- Who was that?
I thought it was Kelly, for God's sake.
I'm the village idiot telling some stranger about our problems like it's CNN.
- Mom, calm down.
- I will not calm down.
We were leaving the doctor and suddenly he insisted We come to your house.
When you weren't here, he got very upset and locked himself in your room with a gun.
- Dad has a gun?
Apparently.
He must've had it in that ridiculous fanny pack he wears like some geriatric Dirty Harry.
- Where the hell did he get a gun?
How should I know?
You know how paranoid he is.
You can buy guns in vending machines now.
- Call the cops.
- No.
I will not have some SWAT team blasting through the door scaring your father to death.
Just stay away from him.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
I gotta go.
- Same guy.
- Here he comes.
Good afternoon, Mr. Meter-Maid, sir.
Where'd you get those tickets?
Kinko's?
Nice pants.
Nick?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?
- Did Theo call you?
- Is this a bad time?
He's been threatening to kill himself for the last 20 minutes.
- I'm sorry, who are we talking about?
- My husband.
Herb, I want the truth.
After 42 years, not a hell of a lot to ask.
Along with everything else, he's cheating.
Mr. Gold, this is the police.
Can you hear me?
Herb.
What did you do?
- Wait.
- Marty.
Holy moly.
Put down the gun.
- Oh, Lord.
Enough already.
- Marty, you look like crap.
He's not well, Nick.
He thinks you're his dead brother, Martin.
You're lucky.
He won't shoot Marty.
- I've always been lucky.
- Kid.
You need a haircut.
I said I'd stay with him in sickness and in health.
Now he's sick and I'm staying.
But I can't abide the cheating.
These are hotel receipts.
That's where he takes her.
Just follow him.
I'll pay.
I wanna know the truth.
That sounds like a bad idea.
Wait a minute.
Didn't Theodore call you?
I heard about your son's car being stolen, thought I could help.
What car?
- Oh, my God.
The Hawk?
- Where's Dad?
- Where's the car?
- Is he okay?
He's sleeping.
And I'm just fine, thanks for asking.
Detective Blades happened to stop by and everything's under control.
- I heard about the car.
- You heard about the car.
He heard about the car.
That's why he's here, Theo.
He's agreed to help find the car.
And the other matter?
Forget the other matter for the moment.
You and Theo find the Hawk.
I'll do everything I can to keep this from your father.
I'll expect regular reports.
- She wants reports.
- I heard.
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay.
This is a very comfortable mattress.
- It must have cost you a bundle.
- Probably did.
Kelly bought it.
- Where did you get a gun, Dad?
- I bought it.
- Five, maybe seven years ago.
- Why?
Same reason everybody buys one.
It's a crazy world out there, son.
And I got like 30 percent off.
Don't you tell your mother.
I think the cat's out of the bag, Dad.
Am I dreaming this or is your Uncle Marty here?
Uncle Marty?
Of course, he had to leave.
Took my gun.
I think that's probably for the best.
Theo, your mother has to try this mattress.
I mean, it is incredible.
You should try it.
Come on.
Try it.
Come on.
Yeah.
So?
It is. it's a great mattress.
It is sublime is what it is.
Yeah.
It's nice.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
- What's the car worth?
- I have no idea.
- Five?
- Triple that, at least.
In Buenos Aires, it's worth 100.
Now it's in a garage.
Tomorrow, on a truck.
Monday, on a ship.
- You got 48 hours.
- That's what the police are for.
Trust me, you're not getting any play from the department.
- Why you doing this?
- Two hundred a day, courtesy your mother.
You get your way, I'm gonna need all the money I can scrape together.
I'm not dropping the charges, even if you do find the car.
It's not just about the money.
Technically, it's my fault.
- Why?
- Yesterday I busted a guy named Gil Ott.
- You know him?
- How would I know him?
Gil was carrying a newspaper with plates numbers written in code on it.
Your plate number was on the list.
I'm not surprised somebody has his eye on the Hawk. it's a very nice car.
- Your mother seems to like it.
- She better like it.
I wasted every weekend of my childhood working on that damn car.
It's a bit hard to explain.
It's kind of like their second child.
I get it.
So, what do we do?
We go see Ott, you slap him around a little he tells us where my car is?
When I arrested Gil, I had to be in court, so I had to park him.
While you were blasting me in front of the jury, he slipped.
- How did he slip?
- I have no idea.
But I'll assume that he delivered a copy of the list once he got out.
So how do we find my oar?
How should I know?
- Aren't you, like, some great detective?
- Yeah.
Although, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Grab a mirror out of the glove box.
I think I got a tail.
Don't do that.
What--?
What--?
A real Second Amendment man, huh?
You ever use one of those?
I'm a lawyer.
My mind is my weapon.
I'm betting you're gonna shoot me long before I find your car.
Come on.
- Is this Gil supposed to be dangerous?
- Gil's not here.
Why are we here?
Come on, let's go.
- I left the gun in the car.
- Good.
The martial way is more than a sport.
It is our discipline.
It is our philosophy.
It is our way of life.
Gentlemen, we honor the master and the practice by bowing when we enter the dojo.
We're police.
You Edward Mackie?
Actually, I'm with the district attorney.
Are you insane?
Ever see that scene in Indiana Jones where he watches some guy with a big sword do his thing and then shoots him?
In this situation, I'm Indy.
Move.
Now.
- Sir, you can't park here.
- Do me a favor, pal--
Move.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Theodore, put thing down before you kill someone.
Hey.
Hey, give me a break.
- Sorry.
- A little pass for a fellow law enforcer?
It's already in the book.
Thanks for everything.
That's why those people are so widely despised.
There's no give and take.
No compromise.
What does any of this have to do with my car?
This one's on the list too.
It's Ed Mackie's.
- That was Ed in there, the karate guy?
- Yeah.
- Where's Ed?
- I guess Ed fled.
- Yo.
- Ed Mackie has a sheet.
In prison, he was with the 4-4 Syndicate.
Another one of the 4-4's, I suspect, looking for Gil at his father's place.
Do me a favor, ping the rest of the names before I do more good deeds.
Start with Dean Nickerson.
Tried him this morning.
He's in jail.
Since when did Gil Ott get connected?
The boy's running so he must have burned somebody.
- Run the rest, see what comes up.
- Okay.
I seem to recall something about my mother paying you to find my car?
It's a 1956 Studebaker Golden Hawk?
Remember?
- What do you know about prison gangs?
- A prison gang has my car?
Possibly.
There seems to be a connection between gangs and the list.
Before I was chief assistant, I did head up the gang prosecution unit.
- I put Willie Van Beber on death row.
- Really?
- Really.
-Isn't he about to be executed?
Couldn't happen to a nicer fellow.
Get in.
Get in.
Come on, move, move.
- You, too.
- Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go.
You hungry?
The doughnuts here are excellent.
No, thanks.
You're like a walking cliché.
- Prosecutors don't eat?
- We eat when we're not being kidnapped.
Brother Blades.
So nice to see you.
Happy, this is my partner, Roberto Clemente.
The sainted ballplayer. it's my honor.
So I send one of my guys to find Gil Ott and he ends up locked up.
You know anything about that?
I heard some old guys kicked the shit out him.
- What's fresh?
- The maple just came out.
Give me six maple, two glazed, and four chocolate with rainbow sprinkles.
And I'll need the paper back when you're done reading it.
It's like warm maple syrup being poured over your tongue.
- Rover.
- Cost me 50 grand to bail him out.
- That's a lot of doughnuts.
- You still police?
- Technically, he's on administrative leave.
- Technically.
Why do they never see that coming?
What a waste of 50 grand.
Take the damn handcuffs off, idiots.
- You make any sense of this?
- License plate numbers.
That one on the list?
Yep.
It's mine.
Better watch it.
People are stealing the cars on this list.
Yeah.
I'll make sure to use my Club.
That was my guy yesterday, outside the bar.
- Guy in the ski mask?
- Yeah.
Why a wool mask in July?
I was hoping to grab Gil before he delivered the paper.
So I did you a favor.
Figured the paper was for you.
No, the paper wasn't for me.
Prison gangs have an unnecessarily bad reputation, Blades.
4-4 Syndicate started with four poor convicts on the four yard at Angola.
I was one of them.
It was a social club.
I understand you've since diversified considerably.
And like all other complex organizations, we have our internal differences.
The newspaper was a delivery from Willie Van Beber to a pro hitter, identity unknown.
You know who Van Beber is?
Big shot 4-4.
About to get the needle, right?
Me and Willie, we started out together.
Now he's angry at me for various reasons.
He's running out of time.
So, he's tidying up his affairs.
You get me?
I believe I do.
So you didn't do me a favor.
You screwed things up.
I don't need that list.
It's already been replaced.
I need Gil because he's the one that can ID the person out on the street taking orders from Van Beber.
- Still with me?
- Yeah.
If you hadn't popped Gil, I'd have his contact and it would be over.
I'm genuinely sorry.
I had no idea my nose was in your business.
- Yeah.
These things happen.
- So where's Ed?
Ed's dead.
Or will be shortly.
And you better keep your eye on your little pal Roberto the DA because if he's not on the list, he will be.
You know he's the one that put Willie down.
He's on the list.
Like I said, find Gil.
Get his contact, take him off the street, or feed him to me.
Then, hopefully, Van Beber will go to his great reward and I'll get back to my goddamn doughnuts.
- Blades.
-It's not cars. it's bodies.
- That's illegal now.
- Hold on.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
I mind.
You're putting my life at risk and those of everyone around you.
Idiot!
Hey, I'm back.
Got four license plates.
Other than Gold, three white males all have long sheets, all are 4-4's.
Are you ready for the best part?
How many non-Whole Foods dinners am I up to?
I'm going to prison soon.
Two of out of the three have federal jackets.
Happy Conners is a Snitch?
That's hard to believe.
Negative. it's Ed Mackie and Dean Nickerson are the informants.
- Which agency?
- FBI.
Happy says it's a hit list from a guy named Willie Van Beber.
Know him?
Yeah, he's a 4-4 shot caller.
I thought they executed him.
Very soon.
This is his last hurrah.
It has to be one of us who sold Van Beber the names of the informants.
Who has access to the FBI informant database?
Anyone senior in this department or in any other in the region, state or federal.
Why is Gold on the list though?
I'm sure there's more than a few who wanna smoke Gold.
I expect it's because he put Van Beber on death row.
Our hero.
So do you want me to run it up the pole?
No, we put this out there, our leaky cop evaporates.
True.
Glass finds out I'm working this, he'll have a coronary.
I don't need that.
- What are you doing?
- I'll see if Dee has a line on Gil.
- Let it ride for a few hours.
- You sure?
- Come on!
What are you doing?
- No.
Come on!
Dude!
You coming?
Five-0 in the house.
Was that really necessary?
I keep my love of food and my professional life separate.
- Fatty.
- Blades.
Give me a slab to go with the sauce on the side.
I heard you paid off that jury.
I had no choice.
Couldn't live without your ribs.
And you get off?
You know there ain't no justice.
Along with my order, I'll need an address on Gil Ott.
I don't know no Gil.
I know a Phil, goes by Little Philly.
And I do know me a Bill.
Theodore, assume for a moment most of the people in this place are on parole, probation or otherwise in the system.
How long would it take for me to find out one of them is in possession of a gun resulting in their immediate and protracted incarceration?
You ain't even no police.
Technically, I'm on administrative leave.
Feel free to call me any time within the next five minutes.
Yeah.
Planting evidence, a.k.a. framing.
Most importantly, what does any of it have to do with finding my car?
- You didn't even get what you came for.
- I did.
Fat Dee didn't even tell you where Gil is.
Talk to me.
Thanks, Fatty.
I owe you.
Hey.
You can't just go and do whatever you want in life, Blades.
There are systems and rules.
These systems and rules exist for a reason.
- You've prosecuted hundreds of cases.
- Yes.
And not once have you just cut a corner, just bent a little.
You know what the United States Supreme Court says?
United States Supreme Court says a prosecutor is a representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy.
No, sir.
As a prosecutor, I am the representative of our sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.
- You lost me at Supreme-something.
- Which means, detective my solemn obligation is not to win cases, but to do justice.
I make one wrong move, I'm worse than the guy I'm prosecuting.
- It must be very tiring to be you.
- It can be.
It's very tiring to be around you.
You just bought a slab of ribs.
You kidding me?
The last time I ate at Fat Dee's, I was on the toilet for a week.
This place rocks.
I'll have a number three.
What are you having?
I'm feeling really lost.
Can you try and explain to me what's happening?
Your car look anything like that?
That's it.
I don't believe this.
That's it.
That's my car.
- I'm waiting on my sandwich.
- Who cares about your sandwich?
I'm sorry, Theodore, I would, I swear.
I have to meet with someone.
It's important.
- More important than my car?
- Hard to imagine, but yes.
Give me the keys.
It's good news.
We know it's still on the street.
I'm done.
Maybe I haven't made myself clear on how important that oar is to my father.
To me.
- I realize this is all just one big joke to you.
-It's not.
I need to find that car, Blades.
My family is gone, my career is shit, my mother's insane and my father's dying.
The one thing I got half a chance of doing is finding that car.
And if you can't or won't help me, then goddamn it, I will do it myself.
Get off.
Get off.
- Get off me.
- Sorry about this, Theodore.
Hello?
I'm kidnapped.
Here, here.
This is why this country's going in the toilet.
- I've been kidnapped.
- What's with your perp?
- Actually, that's the guy prosecuting me.
- Really?
- Really.
- Edward Mackie's dead.
I just saw him.
Called from the trunk of his car after you told me about the list.
- Died before we got there.
- Trunk?
What happened?
A pro, for sure.
You were right about Mackie, he was working for us.
- Happy Conners said he'd get hit.
- Happy Conners is a lucky bastard.
Mackie would have put him down forever.
I was actually figuring Happy for the body.
I don't think so.
Happy's on the list.
He tried to get it stopped.
- You know Willie Van Beber?
-4-4 number-one shot caller?
Happy said it's his thing.
They must have some kind of beef.
Van Beber's settling up before he gets executed.
They wanna kill each other, it's fine with me.
Start smoking my informants, I get annoyed.
I mean, Mackie means we lose two ongoing investigations.
He made the list for putting Van Beber on the row.
- How nice.
Buy him a drink on me.
- You should be helping.
After you get your delivery boy, plug the damn leak.
We're not even looking for my oar.
I doubt we ever were.
- You need to trust me.
- What do you think I've been doing?
These things take time.
Have faith.
- Those hurt.
- They're supposed to hurt.
I don't understand.
Why are we waiting?
If Fat Dee is right, why don't we just go in and get Gil Ott now?
Fools rush in, my friend.
I hate golf.
Other than working on the Hawk, this was the one thing my father and I did together.
I just always feel like wrapping the clubs around people's necks.
You just have to relax.
H ow?
Before you swing, breathe.
Okay, time's up.
I'll go get him.
If Gil Ott's in there, you think my car is nearby?
- Nope.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- You sure you don't need me?
- You keep breathing.
I'll be back.
- Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
Until about two seconds ago, pretty good.
We were in the middle of a conversation.
How'd you get out?
- Out where?
- Jail.
- You know what was in that paper?
- Blades, I pick up, I drop off.
My job is not to say shit about shit.
If I don't do my job, I'm dead.
Okay?
Paper had the name of 4-4's, two of which were federal snitches.
- One's already smoked.
- Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
It also had the name of a DA named Theo Gold, who also happens to be a friend.
You get the needle for whacking a DA.
- That is not my thing.
- Technically, it is your thing.
You're the only one who can ID the source which is why I assume you're whacked out in this caddy shack shit hole.
That's just rude.
I live here.
- This must be Mrs. Gil.
- Toss it.
Everybody wants you, Gil.
Cops, 4's, FBI.
But I'm the only one that can save you.
Tell them I said hello, and goodbye.
- Easy, tiger.
- Yeah, yeah.
Sit down.
I need your contact.
One name.
Give me that name and maybe I'll let you live so you can remodel.
You're a real sweetheart, Blades.
Back inside.
Now!
You want me to go after them or get those off you?
- Because I can't be in two places at once.
- Forget it.
- I'm really trying here, Blades.
- I appreciate the effort.
Did you ask about the car?
I forgot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I shot you.
Nothing nine Band-Aids and a bottle of Cuervo won't fix.
I did predict you'd shoot me.
I remember.
I decided I wanted to live more than I want my car.
My father will understand that.
I'll take you home.
Just drop me off at my parents'.
I'll break the news.
I can already see his face.
God, I'd do anything to avoid that slightly disappointed but not altogether surprised look.
You know the look?
Please.
I got two ex-wives and a 14-year-old daughter I see one weekend a month.
I know the look.
Theo, go get him before one of the neighbors calls the police.
Yeah.
- Yep.
- What are you doing?
Call you in a bit.
I can't tell whether I'm being guarded or surveilled.
Your little redheaded co-counsel Rosalyn Wohl?
- She's the one that bailed Gil out of jail.
- Really?
Why?
- Thought maybe you'd know.
- I don't know.
I just know her from working on your case.
She's a good lawyer.
- Have access to the informant database?
- Sure.
She just works on misdemeanors.
Why would she want access to that?
- Those names are worth a lot to some.
- Come on.
That's ridiculous.
She can go to any private firm in this city and make five times what she's making.
She doesn't need to sell informant data for money, okay?
- You want me to call her?
Let me call her.
- Thanks, Theodore.
Maybe later.
My mother wants you to come in for my belated birthday dinner.
She also wants to see where I shot you.
And please stop calling me Theodore.
First aid courtesy of Lena Valoise.
I'm living the dream, my friend.
She knows nothing about first aid.
She just likes to see other people's pain.
- She thinks we're looking for the Hawk.
- We're not?
Can you do the entire Valoise family a favor and just stay off the subject?
Please?
Did you know that Robert Evans was our neighbor for a while in California?
Of course, that was before he became huge.
- Actually, he was always huge.
- That's incredible.
Apparently not so incredible that he cast me in anything.
Herb did everyone's teeth back then.
Sonny and Cher.
Bobby Redford.
Bobby had a terrible overbite.
Tell me again.
Who are you?
Blades is the corrupt police officer.
I'm the prosecutor in the case.
That is very interesting.
Your son's a great lawyer.
We would have preferred if he had gone into dentistry but you give them wings, they fly away.
You know how it is, Marty.
I put the moves on Larry Olivier once.
That was before anyone told me about his, you know, style.
Can I have another piece of cake?
Can you just cut it?
Thank you.
- You have a home?
- Not much of one, no.
I used to think I had one.
Now I realize I burned it down without even knowing.
Homes get rebuilt.
All I wanted was to spend whatever time my dad has left driving around with him in the Hawk.
- Pulling plugs.
You know?
- And sending me to prison.
I figured this is the time to be a good son.
After, I'd try to be a better husband and father.
Tell me about your daughter.
She lives with her mom.
All the money I skimmed from the detective busts went toward her school.
Child care, alimony, braces, whatever.
Life.
I feel horrible about it.
You expect me to drop the case because you have the same problems that everybody else does.
- You regret committing multiple felonies?
- I do.
- Regret it or expect me to drop the case?
- Ideally, both.
People get divorced and pay for braces all the time without skimming drug money.
- That's because they're not cops.
They lack opportunity.
Maybe.
I mean, my wife's family has money.
Otherwise my kids would be screwed.
You still can't tell me what we've been doing for the past day?
For the moment, no.
And the car is safely on its way to Argentina.
Bon voyage, old friend.
Theo, Nick, let's go.
I'm starting the movie.
Tomorrow, Again, again and again and again.
-It's a great movie.
- Yeah.
She's not your mother.
What's that about your mother?
Theo was just telling me that Lena's not my mother.
You didn't know that?
I told you, detective, my father dropped me off at the hotel.
I was alone.
- He signed for a nightcap.
- That's really distracting.
- I can't help it.
- Try.
You're lying, Ms. McPherson.
He was there with you.
He used three capital letters to sign for the drink.
WMP.
William McPherson.
Why do you hate me?
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
Don't you know?
I'm Willa McPherson.
People love me.
- You too?
- I can't help it, I love it.
That scene kills me every time.
You mind pausing it?
I gotta hit the restroom.
- WVB?
- Yeah.
The initials at the end of the list.
A signature.
Makes sense, but we figured it came from him.
And I talked to Rosalyn Wohl and she says Gil snitched for her in a possession case last yean
So she felt like she owed him a favor.
Gil gave her some story about the hold being trumped up.
- She seemed really embarrassed.
- Do something for me.
Check and see if Van Beber has any kids.
Nick, what the heck are you doing in there?
- I gotta go.
Just check.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
Okay, that's it.
Thanks everybody for a wonderful birthday.
I'm going home.
- I'll bring your car back in the morning.
- Who said you could take my car?
You say you'll bring it back and I nod like a robot?
I'll take him.
Just let me get this.
Yo.
Detective Blades?
it's Rosalyn Wohl.
- Yes?
- Who is that?
- Is that Rosalyn?
- I'm listening.
- Want me to talk to her?
- What do I get?
He says he'll give you the guy who's killing the people on the list.
All right.
Where?
- Where what?
- I'm scared, Blades.
Just do what he says.
- What does Gil want?
- The list.
-Why?
- If he gets the list back his employer refrains from putting a bullet in his ear.
- So he's trading Rosalyn for the list?
- That's the story.
You don't have the list.
Happy took it.
- Affirmative.
- Why am I on a hit list, Blades?
You know all those bad people you sent to prison?
They ever call to say thanks?
No.
Sometimes I send people to prison for doing bad things.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're bad people.
I appreciate that.
- The list came from Willie Van Beber.
- Really?
Apparently his last wish is for you to precede him to the promised land.
- I should go with you.
- This one's on me, Theo.
Too dangerous.
It hasn't been dangerous so far?
Did you forget the driving range already?
- You shot me.
- And I apologize for that.
- Out.
- I'll stay in the car.
Don't give me a gun.
It's Willie Van Beber.
I'd feel safer with you.
- You trust me?
- I trust you.
I'll have the thin blue line park outside.
Lock the doors.
Stay away from firearms.
- Yeah.
- Happy.
Blades.
If you're not too busy making doughnuts I could use some backup.
You're a cop, Blades.
Why are you calling me?
Well, technically, I'm on administrative leave.
- Where's Blades?
- Garcia, right?
- Gold, yes.
Where is he?
- He went to meet Gil Ott.
I guess he's got Rosalyn Wohl.
- Did he say where?
- I heard Sixth and Concord.
Let's go.
Now.
Come on.
You're staying with me.
Hey, Blades.
- Gil.
How you been?
- Wonderful.
Hands on your head.
Hands.
Come on.
Why the hell isn't Blades picking up?
I don't know.
Am I supposed to know?
Oh, shit.
Call 911 and stay with the car.
-911, what is your emergency?
- Police emergency.
I ran into your father, Gil.
- He's worried about you.
- My father?
That's funny.
That's really-- That's hilarious.
- where's the paper, Blades?
- Happy Conners took it.
Bullshit.
Give me the goddamn paper.
He doesn't have it, Gil.
Happy Conners has it.
And you don't really need it anyway.
Hands up on your head.
I'm really sorry about the way this ends, detective.
I had such a good time watching you in trial.
You were the happiest defendant I've ever seen.
- I try to stay positive.
- Turn around.
You know you were right.
About the list?
It doesn't really make any difference.
But you're a liability now.
You're not the first to say so, although you may be the last.
Thought that kidnapping thing sounded fishy.
I knew you'd respond to a lady in distress.
That's no way to treat an employee.
Independent contractor.
I thought I was doing you a favor though, killing Gold.
He wants to put you away.
Once you know him, his intentions are good.
That's very magnanimous.
So Van Beber's your dad, yes?
Technically, for about another week or so.
Then he's gonna be my dead dad.
So, yeah, sad story all around.
Your methods are unorthodox.
But I must admit, I admire your loyalty.
Police!
A few of my dad's friends.
I'm an only child.
He gets kind of overprotective.
Oh, shit.
Blades.
You could have put my father away for life.
Instead you had to kill him?
- I'm sorry.
I was just doing my job.
- No compromises.
No deals.
Right?
Well, guess what.
No deal for you either.
Don't move.
Yeah, well, Wohl was her mother's maiden name.
Van Beber never married her.
I hate to admit it, Blades, but you're not a half-bad detective.
Okay, enough.
Thank you for driving me home.
I'm gonna go soak in a hot bath the next 85 years.
Are we still on for Whole Foods?
You bet.
Want a ride to work in the morning?
Sure.
How very gallant of you.
Thanks.
-It's tomorrow.
- Again.
- At least this didn't happen on my birthday.
- That's good.
That is good.
- That's bad.
- That is bad.
Still going after my dad for adultery?
If your mom's still hiring.
I need the work.
- You know my dad isn't cheating, right?
- I know no such thing.
It's a fantasy.
He never cheated on her.
She cheated on him.
He's a dentist for God's sake.
- But to the stars.
- Oh, God.
More fantasy.
Does my mother have any actual evidence of this affair?
Her theory is that he takes his girl or girls to this hotel.
- And what do you think?
- I don't get paid to think.
- That's clear.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means I found the car.
If the Hawk was supposed to be on its way to Argentina why did it keep popping up over town?
Excellent question.
You wouldn't expect a thief to steal it then tool around.
- No.
- My dad is a notorious cheapskate.
Except when driving the Hawk.
He would never take a mistress to a swank hotel.
He would park the car in a hotel garage if it meant keeping it off the street.
Yes!
What do you say?
I get a turn at the wheel of this beauty?
All right, you've earned it.
You just go very easy, okay?
She likes to be rewed a lot before she downshifts.
- Taser boy?
- Yes?
Relax.
That video is gonna get me elected.
No bad publicity except if it's an obituary.
- You got my vote.
- Convicts can't vote.
You have to convince 12 jurors, including at least a few females.
Yes.
Yes.
- You must have a lot of tickets.
- Drive!
- The biggest mistake of my life.
- What?
Letting you drive!
Apologize to your father for me.
Dad, I am really, really sorry.
Is he dead?
He never stood a chance against the Hawk.
Who is he?
On Van Beber's payroll, no doubt.
I guess killing his daughter didn't endear us to him.
We got lucky.
I've never been lucky.
Thanks.
For what?
Keeping me alive.
Protect and serve, my man.
That's the job.
So speaking of you sending me to prison ...
We were?
Admittedly, I've had some lapses of judgment.
But I'm really not one of the bad guys.
Yeah, well, I've had some lapses here and there.
And I'm definitely one of the good guys.
Thanks for showing me the forest and the grays.
- Am I supposed to know what that means?
- Not really.
Oh, what am I gonna tell my dad?
What am I gonna tell my dad?
Tell him how much you love him.
The rest is pretty much paint by numbers.
- Have you seen a red Studebaker Hawk?
- Sorry, I haven't.
Son.
Hey.
Dad.
What time is it?
I have some bad news.
What?
Where's mom?
Oh, no, no, no. it's okay.
Mom is fine.
She's fine.
Now, look, Theo.
I don't want you to overreact or anything but it appears as if the Hawk has been stolen.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.
Me?
That oar meant everything in the world to you.
Everything?
No, no, no.
It's a fine automobile but you know what I always say:
it's just a car.
Yeah.
I love you, Dad.
I love you too, kiddo.
We interviewed a few jurors after the mistrial they seemed pretty unimpressed, so we walked away.
But the fact that you decided to dismiss the case doesn't mean Detective Blades is innocent.
- I used to know what that word means.
- Counsel, do you mind?
We couldn't make a case.
We dumped it.
I understand you spent time with Detective Blades looking for your car, which you reported stolen?
- That's true.
- And in fact your father had the car?
We don't choose our parents, sergeant.
Looks like you and Detective Blades had quite an adventure.
Detective Blades was instrumental in uncovering a damaging leak that was in our office.
A leak which had already resulted in the death of an FBI informant.
That's very impressive.
Look you knew at the time that Detective Blades was on administrative leave and he had specific orders not to do any police work.
My mother hired him as a PI to look for the car.
Which your father had.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
I bet Detective Blades went out of his way not to mislead anyone about his status.
He never flipped his badge, right?
Never brandished his gun?
Never once in your presence identified himself as a police officer?
Technically, no.
But he did order a lot of doughnuts.
Gail?
You home?
Hey, remember what we talked about.
Completely uncool to walk around naked in someone else's place.
Gail?
Hey.
Oh.
Aah!
You're up early.
Hey.
Hey.
Mmm.
Check this out.
Oh, I thought you passed this case off to homicide squad last night.
Ooh.
Sorry.
Wrong file.
Oh.
What's this?
That's our future.
I figured after we get married, we're gonna need a new place.
So I have been looking.
And I know you want to live near the downtown.
So all these houses are a 10-minute drive from city center, and they're in good neighborhoods.
Tree-lined streets, good schools.
They all have four bedrooms.
Yeah.
One for us, and there's one for Leo, and there's the office, and the other one could be for, um... a nursery.
Jerry.
I know.
I know.
I'm not...
I'm not saying tomorrow.
Just someday.
If... if we want.
What I want is to be a good mom to the child that I already have...
Mm-hmm.
And to do my best at the job that I just barely started.
And all I want is for you to be happy.
You know what?
We got a lot of time to talk about it.
Or not talking about it.
I mean, actually, I quite like it when we don't talk.
- Me, too.
- Really?
Oh, is it bright in here, or am I being blinded by the radiant glow of our mama-to-be?
What the hell color is morning chartreuse?
That is awesome.
Uh, I love this one.
It's, uh, yellowish, in the... it's in the yellow family.
- Hmm.
- It's nice.
You haven't painted the baby's room?
Okay, I may look like a house, but I still have another month to go, which is good because I obviously need another couple weeks to pick a damn color!
No.
No.
No.
You know, you're right.
You're right.
There's no rush.
There's absolutely no rush.
You got the name.
You got your go bag.
You're ready.
You're ready.
It's good.
You're good.
You're good.
Everything's good.
Hey, buddy.
Buddy.
Sammy.
Oh, what's this?
Well, a groom is supposed to get his best man a gift.
So it's a pocket watch.
Ah.
So you can be at the church on time.
Except it's not gonna be a church.
It's gonna be a beach, so I don't know if it's gonna go with your mankini.
Yeah.
All right.
Am I supposed to get you something?
No.
No.
No.
You just gotta be there, bud.
You know, make sure that I don't... make too big of a fool of myself.
So I have to do magic?
Oh, that's funny.
Oh, and apparently, it's bad luck to, uh, give a watch as a gift, so if you wanna throw me, like, 5 or 10 bucks, then technically, it's not a gift.
10 bucks?
Yeah.
Or you buy me a round.
Then we're square.
Here you go.
That's funny.
Hey, Nash.
Have you seen McNally?
No, not this morning.
No?
Okay, listen up.
For those of you weren't there last night, let me bring you up to speed.
We sent Officer Peck undercover on a missing persons case only to find out that person wasn't actually missing.
On the other hand, Officer Epstein and Diaz followed up on a potentially related cold case, and late last night, found the body of Nicole Marshall at Moore Park.
Marshall was a call girl that did go missing a month ago.
- Where we at with it?
- We're not.
I mean, now that there's a body, it's being handed off to homicide.
Have you seen McNally this morning?
- No.
- No?
Hello?
Good morning.
Uh, I'm sure you and Peck were staying up late last night painting each other's toenails, but you're supposed to be at work.
Sam.
Sam, it's Gail.
He must have stuck her with something.
She's got a needle mark on her neck.
Any dizziness or nausea?
No.
Just a headache.
All right, folks, the lab makes this top priority, so everything gets copied to headquarters and all divisions.
Yeah?
Andy, you okay?
Yeah.
McNally, you able to walk through it?
Yeah, um, I...
I came home, um...
I...
I couldn't have been, you know, later than ten minutes after Gail got here.
But it was dark, and the lamp was on the ground.
Gail was lying right over there, and when I checked her, when I flipped her over, she was unconscious, she had, uh, blood on her face, and her hands were zip-tied.
Um, that's... that's when he... he grabbed me and he...
I don't...
I don't know.
That's all I can remember.
Did you see his face?
Nope.
I mean, I know that he was stronger than me.
He was taller than me.
I mean, I tried to fight him off.
Do you have any idea what he shot her up with?
There's no way to tell without a blood test.
All right, Andy, you're gonna go to the hospital, okay?
No.
No.
Listen, we need to focus on Gail.
If the drug is still in your blood, it's evidence.
It might be the fastest way to find her.
Come on.
Let's get you changed.
I'll go with you.
He came prepared, you know, zip ties, some kind of sedative.
McNally must have surprised him.
She's lucky he didn't grab her, too.
What's your 20?
What's going on?
Please.
I...
I gotta get in there.
Diaz, you gotta calm down, pal.
- It's Gail.
- I know.
All the more reason not to storm in there and contaminate the ne.
We're gonna get this right, okay?
How's Andy?
She's okay.
Sam is with her.
Canvassed the neighbors.
No one saw anything.
All right, then you keep canvassing.
Next block, block after that.
You talk to everybody.
No detail is too small.
All right?
Keep it together.
All right?
On it.
Come on, people.
Let's move it back.
Wrong day to piss me off.
Noelle, you don't need to be here.
Missing officer.
We all need to be here.
We got anything?
Frank, her whole family's police.
They're gonna find out.
Her brother's in deep cover.
I'll have his handler get word.
No surveillance cameras.
Sir, Andy's given her statement.
I'm going with her to memorial.
Look, sir, I'm really sorry.
What?
I just should've fought harder.
I mean, she was in my apartment, and...
McNally.
Don't.
We are going to find her.
Every officer in the city is gonna be on this until we do.
Okay?
- Nash.
- Yeah?
We'll go in my squad car.
Hey.
A... are you sure you don't want me to go with you?
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
Okay, look, Luke caught the Nicole Marshall case.
It's the same M.O. as Peck.
A blonde call girl taken from her apartment.
We have to consider that they're connected.
Callaghan.
How long she been gone?
McNally saw her just after 2:00 a.m.
Coroner's still with the body, but Nicole Marshall had, uh, wounds on her that had started to heal.
So he kept her alive?
About 24 hours.
Okay, so it's the same guy we've got.
We got 14 hours.
All right, let's get moving.
You okay?
Yeah, I just gotta sit down.
Swollen ankles.
Sore back.
How did you handle this?
I was 17.
Right.
Hey.
Uh, what did they say?
Uh, some kind of tranquilizer.
Uh, blood's gone to the lab.
They should have an answer in a couple hours.
- And you?
- I'm fine.
Hospital cleared me.
I guess now we just have to wait for the results.
Uh, yeah.
Really, I'm fine.
I'm gonna get back to work.
Andy.
Look, Gail is missing.
Okay, I gotta go.
Blood work's gonna take a while.
I mean, if I could get up, I'd be out there myself.
Okay.
Fine.
But let me call for a relay.
I'll have a squad car meet you outside,
- take you to the station.
- All right.
Okay.
All right, listen up.
Some of you may know, last night we ran a sting operation at the Archer Hotel.
Officer Peck was the bait.
Just after 2:00 A.M.,
Officer McNally and Peck were assaulted at McNally's home.
Peck was abducted.
No witnesses.
Same M.O. as Nicole Marshall... blonde call girl last seen at the Archer.
Our prime suspect was the subject of last night's operation.
One Charles Davis, age 32, owner of a bio software company, and last known client of Nicole Marshall.
You brought that guy in last night.
Yeah, and we let him go about an hour before Peck went missing.
But if you grabbed him, he knows Gail's police.
Predators like that are arrogant.
The fact that she's a cop might make it that much more of a thrill.
We're waiting for a warrant, and Detective Callaghan's gonna be handling the Marshall angle.
Diaz, Collins, you help him out.
Anything he needs.
All right.
Let's go.
Collins.
We recovered Peck's phone at the scene, and it shows 2 calls to you at 1:46 and 2:05.
So what was that about?
She left me a couple messages.
Wanted to see me.
You didn't go see her?
Actually, uh, I didn't check my phone till this morning.
All right.
I'm gonna need the messages, 'cause we gotta put a time line together for Peck.
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.
Absolutely.
Good.
Detective Callaghan, what can I do to help?
Grab a box.
I.D.E.N.T. hasn't found anything over at Andy's place yet, but we know this guy.
He used gloves, zip ties, some kind of sedative.
Guy this organized, it's not his first time.
I want you to go through these unsolved cases.
Look for anything that pops, so assaults involving needles, injections, call girls.
Sir, how is that gonna help us find Gail?
It's called police work, Officer...
- Collins.
- Collins.
If we bring in Charlie Davis, he's got Gail locked up somewhere, we're gonna need all the leverage we can get.
The more we can tie to him, better chance we have.
You guys already had to let him go once.
Let's make sure that doesn't happen again.
All right.
This warrant covers all of Davis' properties.
Team one, you're on the house.
Team two, you're searching the boat at the marina.
Team three, we got the office.
Now anyone finds anything, you call it in immediately.
All right.
Let's go.
All right, E.T.F.'s moving out.
They'll meet us there.
Okay.
McNally.
What are you doing here?
The hospital cleared me.
Noelle and Traci are waiting on the a little bit results.
Andy, you don't have to do this, okay?
You were assaulted and drugged.
Let her work.
Come on.
Andy's the only person we know for sure who's had any contact with this guy.
Hospital said she's okay.
Let her do her job.
We need everyone we can get, right?
Fine.
But I don't want you anywhere near that search.
Okay.
- You good?
- I'm good, Jerry.
Okay.
Head over to the Archer.
See if anyone saw Charlie Davis
- back there after we released him.
- Okay.
I'll get a ride with McNally, all right?
Okay.
Great to have you back, buddy.
Um, thanks for that.
I'll just here till we find her.
Why didn't you answer the phone?
When Gail called you last night, why didn't you answer?
I was tired.
We call each other a lot.
I thought it wasn't important.
Why?
'Cause you're friends with benefits?
Is that one of the benefits?
You... you don't need to be there when somebody needs you?
Look, you don't know what you're talking about.
I know Gail deserves better.
Right.
Better.
Like you.
Yeah, somebody who actually cares about her.
Somebody who'd answer the phone when she calls.
Somebody who would never let this happen to her.
- Oh, you think this is my fault?
- You don't?
You want to hit me?
Hit me.
That's not gonna help us find her.
We need to talk to all of your employees, everybody who was on shift last night.
Then I'm afraid you're going to have to come back.
The evening shift doesn't begin for another six hours.
What are you still doing here?
It's conference season.
I haven't even been home yet.
- What's this about?
- Part of our investigation.
I already told Detective Barber, this hotel is not responsible for activity that takes place between consenting adults.
Okay, look, we need to know if you've seen this man between 1:30 and 2:00 a.m.
I thought you arrested him.
He abducted one of our officers last night.
What?
Yeah.
We think that he came back and he followed her from here.
Your security cameras... do they record to a hard drive?
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, it holds 30 days' worth of footage.
Great.
Get it all, please.
We'll need everything.
Okay.
Yeah.
I got Charlie Davis right here.
We grabbed him from his office, and we brought him in.
No, we didn't find anything.
What about the boat?
Okay, Charlie.
I'm getting a little tired of this.
So why don't you tell me where my officer is?
Look... if she's okay,
I'm gonna make it clear that you cooperated.
I told you, I don't know where that bitch is.
I swear to God, if anything happened to her,
I mean, if you hurt her in any way, that won't be anything compared to the pain that I'm gonna bring down on you.
Hey.
Hey, I was here last night.
All right?
I was in this chair.
And then I went home.
There are cameras all over my house.
Check with the security company.
They'll confirm it.
Look, I...
I know this must be embarrassing for you, screwing up twice in 24 hours.
But whoever grabbed that cop last night, it wasn't me.
You know, Detective, I hope you have other interests outside this job, because once my lawyers are done with you, you're not gonna have it anymore.
Where am I?
Ah.
You're awake.
What's... what's in my arm?
I'm just trying to keep you hydrated.
That sedative can give you an awful headache.
Yeah.
So will smashing your elbow in my face.
Sorry that had to happen.
Don't worry, though.
I'm gonna get you all fixed up.
You know, for someone who's trying to scare me, it sounds like you're wearing tap shoes.
They're actually... wing tips.
I take it back.
Wing tips are terrifying.
I think... maybe... you woke up too early.
- You should really get some rest.
- What are you doing?
No.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Just relax.
Just... relax.
I'm gonna take care of you.
This is everything from the Archer.
There's no sign that Davis came back after we grabbed him.
Nothing on camera anyway.
The coverage is pretty crappy.
Well, the search at Davis' place didn't turn up anything.
What about his alibi?
It checks out.
Security company has him home 15 minutes after we released him.
I mean, the guy was home all night.
So we're back to zero.
No closer to finding Gail.
Well, we expand our search.
Look for another suspect.
Luke, tell me you got something.
Maybe.
Okay, yeah, I'll take a "maybe."
Diaz and the new kid found a couple of bodies related to some old cases.
It's not exactly on pattern, but...
Call girls?
No.
One of the victims had been tranquilized with a mixture of ketamine and acepromazine.
I traced her back to a dinner reservation at the Archer Hotel the night she disappeared.
So the connection's the hotel.
Like I said, maybe.
Someone who works there.
Makes sense.
Okay, the only staff that knew it was a sting operation was crone, the manager.
Everyone else thought it was business as usual.
Staff would be the perfect cover.
Lots of opportunity to pick a target.
Sure.
Make casual conversation, but nobody really notices you're there.
And they know exactly where the cameras are and how not to be seen if they follow somebody home.
It's Braxton Hicks.
What?
False labor.
It's the dress rehearsal before the big show.
I had 'em for weeks.
Yeah.
Well, Mr. Braxton Hicks can kiss my pregnant ass.
These just keep getting worse.
Since when?
Oh, last night.
Frank ordered thai food, and they haven't stopped since.
Well, false labor's not supposed to last that long.
Noelle.
This could be the real thing.
No.
No way.
Not today.
Not with Gail out there somewhere with some psycho.
But Jerry's got the whole service out looking for her.
I mean, right now you just need to be concerned about yourself for once.
I am not having this baby yet.
Okay.
But if you are having this baby,
I think we should call Frank.
Let him know.
No.
Not with Gail still missing.
He has enough to worry about.
I...
I just hope they're getting close.
22 staff on shift last night in the lounge, lobby, and kitchen, including six with priors.
Six?
That sounds like a lot.
Hospitality industry?
Not really.
We got three assaults, two drug charges, and a mail fraud.
Hey, Sam.
What about this guy?
Bartender?
Uh-huh.
He was hovering all night.
- So anything Gail said to Davis, he could've heard.
- Yeah.
Let me see this.
"Seth Mackeigan.
Minor assault, possession with intent."
It's him.
It's gotta be.
I mean, the bar closes at 1:00.
He would've had time.
It says he drives a gray camry.
Look at this picture.
Surveillance took it 30 seconds after Gail's cab left.
Yeah, gray camry.
How fast can we have E.T.F at his house?
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa.
We're not gonna bust some guy on some minor charges from a couple of years ago for the fact that he was near the hotel where he works.
Yeah, but what if this is the guy?
Then we prove it.
You know what?
We've blown this twice already by jumping the gun, so we just gotta slow things down and take our time and... and put these pieces together.
- Okay.
Okay.
- You know, it's just... chasing false leads is not gonna help us get Gail any faster.
Okay, Peck got into Skyview cab 302.
Go talk to the cab driver.
See if he remembers being followed by Mackeigan.
Then maybe I can get another warrant.
No.
We don't have time for that.
Look, Jerry.
It's him.
It's the bartender, okay?
He sits all night with these girls, okay, asks them who they are, uh, what they do, whether they live alone or not.
He can ask 'em anything, and they just think he's being nice.
Look, Jerry, I think McNally's right.
We've got a window.
Let's check on this guy right now.
All right.
All right.
Fine.
I'm gonna track down the cab driver.
You guys go to the hotel.
Learn anything that you can about Mackeigan, anything that can get us through the door.
And nobody makes a move on him until I say so.
These are all suspicious deaths?
Uh, women all over the city, the last ten years.
Now the red ones are where the bodies were discovered.
The green ones were where they were abducted or where they lived.
And they trace back to the hotel.
At least two, maybe three.
Which one is Peck?
Uh, we agreed we're not putting her up there.
Right here.
These ones fit.
This is where we're gonna find him.
Why is he dumping them in the city?
Knows the area.
It's his comfort zone.
Sir, permission to take out a squad?
And go where?
No offense.
I know this is police work, but we're not detectives.
We're grunts.
Patrol officers.
We should be out there on the streets.
You don't even know what you're looking for.
He's been dumping the bodies in the same 10-block area.
If we beef up police presence in his comfort zone, maybe he'll stay away from it.
We could buy Gail some time.
I'm with Nick on this one, sir.
I say we ride around and see what we see.
There's a lot of people here.
Everybody's on this thing, Luke, so I really think that we should be out on the streets looking for our girl.
I'll let dispatch know if I can narrow it down any further.
Any luck with the footage we gave you?
Yeah.
We need some more information on one of your staff...
Seth Mackeigan.
We need his vehicle pass for the parking lot and his work schedule since he started here.
Sure.
But if you want to talk to him, he's right there.
Seth.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
Stop!
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah?
What'd you do with her, huh?
- Easy.
Easy.
Easy.
- What'd you do with her?
What?
Do with who?
Jasmine, the blonde who was at the bar last night.
You followed her home.
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
Yeah, right.
Why'd you run?
- 'Cause he was trying to flush that down the toilet.
- No, that is not mine.
Last night... where'd you go when you left here?
I...
I...
Jetpack.
It's...
it's an after-hours club.
I deejay there sometimes.
Oh, yeah?
What time was that?
I...
I got there just before 2:00, and then left at 5:00.
Really?
Yeah.
And some of the staff were there.
You can ask them.
Yeah, we'll do that.
Okay.
Ow.
Ow.
Okay, that's okay.
That is okay.
They are... are half an hour apart still, so, you know, even if it is labor, then you got plenty of time.
You know, some people, it can take a... a couple of days.
Jerry, I've called you, like, three times.
Yeah.
I can't, uh,
I can't get this stupid thing off mute.
Okay, don't do it now because you're just gonna end up hanging up on me.
What do you got?
Uh, the lab results from Andy's blood came in.
Yeah, let me guess...
ketamine and acepromazine.
How'd you know?
Well, Nicole Marshall also had traces of it in her system.
It's a medical tranquilizer, but the mix is tricky to administer in the proper dose.
So we're looking for somebody who knows what they're doing.
Any leads?
Well, we think Peck may have been followed by a staff member at the Archer.
A history of drugs.
I'm working on it now.
You think he's the guy?
I don't... look, he better be, because I'm...
I'm running out of options.
I would come and join you, but, um,
I kinda have a bit of a situation here.
Noelle's in labor.
- Already?
- Yeah, but don't tell Frank because she doesn't want him to worry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, you stay there, and I'll call you as soon as we know something.
Ow!
Okay, Jer, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
All right.
Ross Perik?
Uh, that's right.
I'm Detective Jerry Barber, 15 Division.
I have a few questions about one of your fares last night.
Do you mind if I come in a minute?
Uh, by all means, Detective.
Come on in.
Thanks.
So, you had a question about one of my fares?
Yeah, a woman you picked up last night at the Archer around 1:30.
Uh, I'm there a lot.
I don't really, uh, pay a lot of attention to faces.
Well, she's blonde, uh, mid-20s, quite possibly not very nice.
Oh, yes, that does ring a bell.
And you dropped her off at 2768 Carlaw.
She's a police officer.
Yeah, that's right.
I never would have guessed that from the way she was dressed.
Oh, so you do remember?
Uh, w... was there a problem?
Did she... complain about the service?
Now do you remember being followed?
Or maybe you saw someone when you dropped her off?
You know, come to think of it, there may have been a set of lights behind me for a while, but it's, uh... it's hard to say.
Okay.
Do you remember a color or make?
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
All right.
Would you happen to know what time you dropped her off?
It might help us figure out who else was on the street.
Uh...
I...
I'm not sure.
Um, uh, probably 1:45, 2:00-ish.
Well, your meter would have the exact time, right?
Unless you weren't running your meter.
I know sometimes those things get, uh... switched off... by accident, of course.
No.
Detective, I always run my meter.
It's the law.
I'll just get the log.
Would you, um... could you just wait here for a second?
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Every employee who had contact with Gail last night checks out.
Okay, so... so who else did she have contact with?
Maybe she talked to one of the customers.
No.
No.
I mean, I took her out here personally, and I put her straight in a cab.
So you put her in a cab...
I put her in the cab.
I told her that I would be staying with you.
You know, that she would have the place to herself.
Maybe someone overheard you... someone you wouldn't even think was listening.
Same cabbies come here every night.
People get in, tell them exactly where they live.
The cab driver.
That's who Jerry wanted us to check out, but then he said he would do it.
I hope he answers his damn phone.
Three months, you'd think he'd figure out how to use it.
Come on.
This, uh, picture on your bookshelf... where is it?
My girlfriend and I are getting married, and we're looking for a place to honeymoon.
Oh, uh, that's Somalia.
Somalia?
Huh.
What were you doing there?
Charity work.
With Doctors Abroad.
You're a volunteer?
M.D., actually.
Or I used to be.
I needed a change.
Something a little less stressful.
I'm sure you understand, Detective.
Believe me, I do.
So, uh... do you miss it... medicine?
Sometimes.
I'm sorry... but you shouldn't have come here.
Okay.
Skyview cab number 302 is registered to a Ross Perik.
26 Springmore.
All right.
Call Jerry again.
Tell him not to go in without backup.
Tell him to wait for us.
You're a cop.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
!
I'm the one taking care of you.
Come on.
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go!
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I just need a little more time.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh, God, no!
It's Jerry's car.
He's still here.
Jerry's down.
What?
Police!
McNally, clear the house.
1519, I got a 10-33 at 26, uh, Springmore.
I've got an officer down.
I need medics right away, please.
1519, EMS is being
- dispatched to your location.
- Jerry?
Jerry!
- Jerry!
- All units, code 1.
- Officer down...
- How you doing, Sammy?
It's okay.
We're here, brother.
All right?
I repeat... we have an officer down, 26 Springmore, near...
Sammy.
Sammy.
He has her.
He left.
- What?
- He left.
My phone is in his pocket.
It's what?
My phone... is in his pocket.
You put your phone in his pocket?
Just follow the phone...
- ... and you'll find him.
- All right.
My phone... okay, all right, all right.
Hey.
Here.
Look, the house is clear.
Perik's gone.
- I think he was keeping her in the basement.
- Okay.
I got this.
All right, I need you to call in,
- get 'em to track Jerry's cell phone right now, okay?
- Okay.
All right.
It's with the subject, and he's got Gail!
Okay, dispatch, um... we need G.P.S. on a Detective Jerry Barber's phone number.
His cell number.
Copy that.
I'll have the comm center...
You did good, bud.
We're gonna get her, all right?
Good job.
You finally found a use for that cell phone, huh?
Jerry?
Jerry, stay with me.
Jerry?
Jerry?
That's it.
Look at me.
Hey, Trace, um... call me when you get this.
Um, I'll try you at home again.
Swarek, what's the word?
Uh... stab wound to the abdomen.
It's bad.
When will we know?
- You heard.
We got Gail back.
- Yeah.
Yeah, Callaghan and the boys, they, uh, narrowed down where they thought they might be, so, we, um... we were, uh...
we were in the neighborhood.
Phone trace took us right to him.
Yeah, can you believe that Jerry finally figured out how to work that thing?
How's Gail?
- Uh... she's good.
- Mm.
You know.
I mean, she's upstairs.
He didn't... she's okay.
Frank, what do we know about this guy?
Well, Callaghan's working on it now.
But it looks like he was some kind of a, uh, doctor, lost his license about six, seven years ago.
Sergeant, have you been able to get a hold of Traci?
'Cause I can't get her.
No.
She hasn't been picking up.
Last I heard, she was waiting here for your lab results.
Dr. Stevens to admitting.
Dr. Stevens, come to admitting.
She is beautiful.
And healthy.
You did great.
Happened so fast, I didn't have much choice.
I kinda always wanted a girl.
No, sorry, Nash.
She is all mine.
Well... probably gonna have to get one of my own, 'cause Jerry's gonna insist when he meets this little angel.
Yes, you.
I know you wanted to wait, but, uh... ohh.
You think we can call Frank now?
Okay.
Okay.
Ohh...
Oh, they must have found Gail.
I've got like ten messages.
Andy.
What's going on?
Where's Jerry?
Traci...
- Oh...
- Where is he?
I'm s...
I'm so sorry.
No.
No!
No!

[chuckles] Okay, lover boy.
I'll see you in second period.
[girl on motorcycle] Hey, bitch.
And don't you forget it, bitch.
[laughing]
Us bitches gotta stick together right?
Yes, we do.
So what is the collective noun for a group of bitches?
- A flock?
- A gaggle.
- A platoon.
- A swarm.
Oh, I know, a herd.
Oh, yeah, thanks, makes us sound like a bunch of cows.
Moo, baby.
[shocked shrieking]
You little shit.
Aww, so sorry, did I invade your personal space?
Here, let me help.
I don't want your fucking help.
[laughs]
Very immature, guys.
"She touched me, like no guy has ever."
Jealous much?
Jesus, there's a case for selective breeding.
Little shit's too big for his boots.
Needs respect.
What the fuck are you looking at Chantelle?
[gasps] Shit he scratched my phone.
Did you get another new phone?
Yeah, it's a bit chunky but shiny, touch.
It's only like three months old.
I got her old iPhone.
Yay.
- Wow, it's impressive.
- [school bell ringing]
And it's shiny and has pretty pictures.
Oh, and YouTube.
Most phones have YouTube.
Hello, shiny, pretty pictures.
Oh, my God.
[laughing]
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah, totally, Kyle is coming.
Already?
Yeah, I've heard that about him.
Won't see much of you two then.
I hope not, nothing personal.
Has anyone spoken to Tess?
Yeah, she's totally in, and Stu of course.
- What about Marty?
- Yeah, what about Marty?
- [laughing] - [school bell ringing]
We were just talking about you.
And a hot and steamy dream Brie had about you.
Do tell.
Well, you were both lying naked inserting your memory sticks into each others USB ports.
Ew geek porn.
- [laughing]
- I'm impressed.
I didn't--
That Jules knows what a USB is.
You're right, my God, the nerd gene is contagious.
And the geek shall inherit the earth.
Thought that was cockroaches.
Besides, haven't you heard, geek is the new chic.
- Is that the new N97?
- I hear it has Maemo 6.1.
Bluetooth three plus.
Yeah, and pretty pictures.
Why do I hang with you dorks again?
Intelligence by association.
Comic value maybe?
You're secretly a geek.
You own more gadgets than anyone I know.
That's not a geek, that's Daddy's little Princess.
Hello, I'm right here.
Perhaps try insulting me when I'm not around.
If you insist.
[Jules] Ah, thanks.
Enjoy the intellectual stimulation of media.
Later bitches.
Why do we hang out with her again?
I don't know.
Jules is okay.
Come on, guys, you know the rules, pop your phone in the box.
Thank you.
Bonjour, mon cheri.
Thank you.
Good morning, class.
[all] Good morning, Ms. Halms.
Now some of you may have noticed that we no longer have cell phone coverage in this classroom.
- [girl] Oh, what?
- [groaning]
And we will be implementing and enforcing a ban on phones in class as in exam conditions.
You have been warned.
[groaning]
Now, luckily, the jammer I have will send all of your calls and messages through to your voice mail, so I'm not denying service I'm simply diverting.
[phone beeping] [laughter]
Although, I wasn't expecting such a quick response.
- Hand it over, Mr. Pollock.
- Me?
I, I've been warned.
As you seem to have such a keen interest in this, you won't mind joining me over term break to help tighten up the protocol.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
See me after class.
And your Dad's cool?
I was just honest with him.
We have an understanding, he keeps me on a long leash, and I won't bite.
Oh, smart man.
He was overprotective for awhile you know, after mum.
Here it is.
YouTube's finest.
Oh, much amusement at the expense of others.
A personal favorite of mine.
Well you have to dig for gold among the Star Wars fan movies and foolish teens flashing their bits.
You know Marty's thinking of web-casting our party on Screen-It.
I thought that got shut down.
After that bully-bash thing?
Apparently not.
So where is this place again?
I don't know, some swanky beach-house
Jules found out about.
Marty was going to send everyone the location but I'll text him.
So when are the semi-naked guys going to writhe wet and exposed for us girls hey?
- Hit the showers girls.
- Here they come, go Kyle.
Come on, my baby.
Go Kyle show us what you got.
We all know what you've got Kimmy.
We've seen the videos.
Bitch.
Remember what we practiced, focus on the catch.
Watch the streamlining, 24 straight, qualify first.
Come on.
On your marks, get set.
[air horn blasting] [cheering]
Beautiful.
[* "Set Yourself On Fire" The Killgirls]
Come on, Kyle.
Go, son!
Go, Kyle.
That's it, come on.
Do you think Kyle's dad's kind of hot?
Come on, push.
Yeah, in like a prison guard sort of way.
Come on!
I'd do him.
Come on, son, go!
[cheering]
Yes!
Ah, for christ sake.
Macka!
Oi, what do you think you're doing, you can't work here.
- [Kyle's dad] Macka, get out here!
- I'll deal with you later.
- [Kyle's dad] Macka!
- My poor baby was robbed.
- [Macka] Hold your horses.
- Well, what the hell are you doing?
- What?
- Well, look at the clock!
- Yeah, and?
- It's still going isn't it?
- [Macka] Yeah.
- [Kyle's Dad] Well, it shouldn't be.
Once they fix the timer and re-calibrate, we'll re-run it tomorrow.
Now on your bike, fix it.
Stay in the pool.
Haven't you got class Miss Freeman?
Some people would say I have a lot of class.
[message tone beeping]
Hey, didn't Mike used to coach Macka or something?
Um, yep they had a falling out.
- Drugs.
- Ohh.
Punches were thrown, blood was let, usual macho bullshit.
Before or after his, the drink-driving thing?
- Just before.
- Wow, sounds complicated, girl.

Hey, Dane.
- What's up?
- What's up?
You very well know what's up, Miss Wisemann.
No helmet, reckless driving, that little stunt you pulled back there through the park.
Come on, don't be a stiff.
A girl's gotta have some fun.
Besides, hey, I can handle myself.
I'm sure you can, look, just put a helmet on, you know, and set a good example and all.
Oh, like you?
Go on, get outta here.

Aw, come on.
[phone buttons beeping]
Hello?
Hello.
[screaming] [laughing]
- Good one, Kyle.
- What?
[boy] Aww, Brisie-poo.
Shut up.
You should have seen your face.
Wow, couldn't have found anywhere a little more--
- Vulgar?
- Discrete?
Who owns this place?
Apparently they're O.S. Jules got a tip-off.
That's not the only tip Jules is getting off.
[Amy] Oh, God.
Brie, just chuck your stuff in the kitchen.
[doorbell ringing]
I reckon it will just be the guys, hang on.
I'll get it.
Hey.
- [shouts] - [screams]
Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of me.
Anyone would think you're breaking the law or something.
Don't tell your dad.
- Hi.
- Hiya.
- Hey, how are you going?
- Good, let's get shit faced.
Let's.
[giggling]
Wow.
Tada.
Are they started already?
Ah, get a room you two, honestly.
Now that's a good idea.
Hey, you.
[Brie] Found their password yet?
[chuckles] Idiots.
- Hey, bro.
- Tess, let me get you a drink.
It's been awhile man, how's things at the mill?
You know, same old.
Old man's still busting my balls.
Yeah it's a bummer you had to drop out.
- Hey, beverage?
- Brought my own mixer.
Oh, how obliging.
I saw your slice and dice stunt on Screen-It.
Yeah, some roadkill I found.
Frozen solid then put it through the big kahuna blade.
- Instant anatomy lesson.
- Yeah, hey, got it up.
Look, look, look, look, look.
Shut up back there okay just, fuck off, okay.
- Oh, God.
- Okay, let's do it.
[groaning]
You're a sick man.
[screaming]
It gets better.
It doesn't even have a heart.
Wait for it, wait for it.
[screaming] [guys cheering]
You did not just do that.
Can't believe I watched that.
Seriously, we, no.
Marty, load these up, more PG friendly.
- Ugh.
- I'm gonna be scared for life.
We are wired and ready to roll.
These should up the party ante.
You're a bad girl, Jules.
This is pretty hard-core, huh?
This is some serious setup dude.
Everything controlled by my trusty mobile.
I've got my whole house setup back home.
Hey which one do you wanna start with?
Crazy Japanese Show.
Oh, my God, I love that show.
Hey have guys seen the J-Pop girls?
Speed?
- Yes.
- It's so tacky it's delicious.
- How good is it.
- That is cool.
Hey are we all set to live-cast our party later?
All set to Screen-It.
Hey, guys, get closer, let's immortalize the crime.
Let's do it.
[laughing]
That's going straight to Facebook.
Time to get off your face-book.
[laughing]
Hey, that was awesome, but that takes time so here's one I prepared earlier.
Uh-huh.
[cheering and laughing] [vehicle approaching] [horn honking]
Hey, pizza's here.
- [Stu] Pizza!
- [Brie] Ah, pizza.
Kyle, it's your dad man, your dad.

[woman] Hi, Mike, I suppose you're after Kyle.
They're playing games upstairs, hang on.
[laughing]
That is fucking wild.
- Shh.
- How did you do that?
I hacked an automated SKYPE message bank app.
Shut up, shut up.
All right.
[computer beeping]
Hi, Dad, what's up?
You checking' up on me?
[Mike] Well, what do you think after what happened in the pool today?
Look, just wanted to remind you we have a 6:00AM start tomorrow, so don't stay up all night playing games.
Okay, Dad, is that it?
[Mike] Okay, now I expect a PB tomorrow.
Okay, Dad.
Can I go now?
[Mike] I'll see you in the morning.
[computer beeping] [cheering and laughing]
- That is cool.
- What!
The things you can do with open-source code and Bluetooth.
I think I'll have that joint now.
[Brie] That's tweet-worthy even.
It's like the modern equivalent of a forged note.
I think I'll join you.
What about your PB tomorrow?
Tomorrow, I'm going for a PB tonight.
No smoking inside, okay?
Go out back.
[Stu] Yes, mom.
Sorry.
Coming?
It's not my thing.

Ha-ha, very funny.
Quit messing around, guys.

- What?

Marty, you're such a jerk.

Marty?
Jules?
Stu?
Where are you guys?

[message tone beeping]
[man] Six blind mice, no where to run.
Who'll be the first one to start crying...
[Brie] Marty?
...when they discover they're all going to die?
Oh, dear, poor little mice.
The fate of your friends is in your hands, Brie.
- Marty?
- If you're clever enough, and if you play by the rules, no parents, no authorities.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
What?
- [phone buttons beeping] - [woman] The number you have dialed is currently switched off or not in a mobile serviced area.
Please call again later.

Hello?

Kyle, you wanker.
[man] Hello.
Are you enjoying this little game?
- What the fuck?
- I know I am.
By the way, there are only two rules in this game.
Rule number one, no parents.
Rule number two, no authorities.
- Listen here, you little shit.
- Simple isn't it?
Have fun.

[sirens blaring]
Breezer?
It's kind of late isn't it?
Yeah, well, must have lost track of time.
Are you okay?
Have you been drinking?
No, no, God no.
I've been at Jules' place.
But Jules' place is on Carlson Road.
I took the scenic route.
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna follow you home and make sure you get there safe.
Dane, look I'm fine, honestly.
Look, I'm going to do this.
I'm not gonna ask any questions, capiche?
[crying]
Daddy!
[banging]
[Marty] Uh...
it sounds kind of hollow.
Bye, Brie.
Hey, hey, hang on, you're breaking up.
I think the door closer is interfering or something.
Brie, I wouldn't mess around with this sort of shit, okay?
I really am in some sort of box.
- I got this freaky video...
- [phone beeps]
Hello?
Brie?
Hi.
[message tone beeping]
Brie... check this out.
[phone buttons beeping]
- Holy shit, you're in a box.
- No shit, Sherlock.
How?
I don't get it, we were--
Look I am freaking out here, you have to find me.
I woke up in that house all alone and you guys had gone.
What am I going to do?
I have no fucking idea.
The last thing...
Oh, my God.
I don't remember.
Um, okay, something odd is going on here.
I have erratic phone coverage and there is no data connection,
I'm surprised the MMS got through.
Marty, what am I supposed to do?
[Marty] Did you get the other message?
The smiley face thing with you guys all in boxes?
Yeah, I though that was a joke, I thought you--
Brie, hey, whoa, whoa, hey all... wait, all of us?
Yeah my message said the fate of your friends is in your hands.
Friends as in plural.
And then it had a montage of images of you guys all in boxes.
Oh, God, this is real.
That's different to mine.
Send it to me.
What the hell's going on?
Brie, we need you.
You know, I knew something was up, you'd never leave your lappy and your PS3 behind.
At least you're safe.
Hey, listen, tell the others not to use video call, it chews through the battery and we need- [phone beeping]

- Tess?
- Dad, you've gotta help me.
What do ya mean sweetheart, what's going on?
I don't know, I just woke up and I'm locked in a box.
I'm so scared.
What do you mean you're locked in a box?
What are you... sweetheart, have you been taking drugs or something?
Um...
I was at a party and I don't know what happened.
I don't remember anything.
Hang on, hang on, just calm down.
So you're telling me that you were at a party and someone put you in a box.
I mean can't you get out of it?
What is it, a cardboard box or what?
No, it's like a wooden box.
I really don't know what happened, Dad.
It smells funny, it's musty.
- So you're telling me--
- Just hang on a second, okay?
I've got a message, I'm gonna put you on hold.
It might be the others.
Others, sweetheart what do you mean by-- [phone beeping]

Rule number one, no parents.
Rule number two, no authorities.

[Tess] Hey, Dad.
Nardine, it's Gary, just hang on a sec will you?
Sweetheart?
- [Tess] Dad, I've messed up.
- Hey, hey, slow down.
Please tell me you didn't call anyone.
No, I haven't, but I've got Nardine on the other phone.
[Tess] No, no, no, you can't tell anybody.
Okay.
Seriously, you can't tell anybody.
Okay, okay, I get it.
Just hang on, hang on.
Nardine, I'm sorry, just a false alarm.
Turns out Tess is at a friend's place.
[laughs] You want Dane to go and check on 'em?
No, no, I'll go and pick her up now.
Things we do for our kids, eh, sarge?
You know, my Philip--
Yeah, wouldn't want it any other way.
Look, nothing unusual to report down there, everything okay?
[sighs] It's been quiet actually.
A bit bored really,
I've been trying to get on the internet but--
Right, right, good, well, I've gotta go.
We did have one...
Hello?
- [Gary] Sweetheart?
- Dad, it's all right.
I'm okay.
From the start, tell me what the message said.
No, dammit, Jules, you can't call your dad.
They might be listening.
[Jules] I mean how do we even know this is real?
How can they be monitoring all of our calls, it's crazy.
Do you wanna take that risk?
Think, Jules.
Have you spoken to the others?
[Kyle] I spoke briefly to Amy.
Oh, so you call her before you call your girlfriend.
She called me.
She said she could smell petrol,
I told her not to use her phone, it could cause a spark.
The petrol's burning my skin.
Kyle said not to make anymore calls, but I'm so scared.
I mean, why the fuck would they cover me in petrol, Brie?
Just, sit tight Ames, okay?
Marty said to get us all on a conference call, rather than everyone wasting precious battery life calling each other.
Well, I think my credit's low.
Just hurry up, okay?
Please hurry up.
I'm trying, all right?
- I don't...
I...
- [phone beeping] [crying]
[panting]
[grunts]
[beeping]
You need to calm down, I'd gladly swap positions.
I can't.
Bullshit.
Of course you can.
Don't sell yourself short, you are stronger than you think.
It's what I dig about you.
Okay.
Say it with gusto.
Okay!
Thank God.
Now, you realize it's you and me.
No one else is going to get us out of this.
So you need to focus.
[exhales]
Yeah, I tried, the only other person I can get through to is Kyle.
He said his is wet.
Mine just smells.
It's like I'm buried, but there's light coming through.
Smelly?
Are you serious?
I'm basted and ready to cook here.
It's not all about you Ames.
There's bigger picture stuff going on here.
[grunting]
Hey, I've been trying to call.
Have you heard from Tess?
No, her line's busy.
Breezer's still trying.
We're going to do a conference hookup thing and figure this out, so keep the line free.
Man, I don't remember anything after those pills.
Just stay cool, we'll talk in a minute.
Hey, I was gonna call my cousin, he's into technology and stuff and I thought he might be able to find us using some triangulation shit.
Don't call anyone yet, just keep it together, man.
[beeping]
- You wanna see it?
- Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
Wait, what's that, what's that?
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah.
Dude, come on, click.
Yeah, okay, okay.
Still can't get on to Tess, but Marty and I thought it was imperative that we're all brought up to speed.
[Jules] Up to speed?
We're all fucked, is that up to speed enough for you?
Let her speak.
For all we know Brie's in on this shit.
What makes her so special not to get fucking taken.
- Shut up, Jules.
- Yeah, shut up.
I think we all realize this is either some sick prank or something freaky is going on.
You got that right.
I'm covered in fucking petrol.
Okay, we're gonna go around, um, systematically, one by one, and you tell me what you see, what you smell,
- stuff like that.
- We're wasting time.
How the fuck else do you think we are going to work this out unless we get all our info sorted, huh?
We should call the cops and take the risk.
Last time I checked cops were filed under authorities.
Use your head for once in your perfect little life.
Okay, okay, Jules.
Marty's right.
We all have to calm down.
Oh, that's fine for you, Brie, you're not the one in a fucking box.
My box is damp.
It's leaking, there's water in the bottom.
I'm laying in a few centimeters of water.
Um, I can't hear much but I don't know,
I could be in a sewer.
I think I'm floating.
Okay, good.
Either way, I'm definitely not out in the open.
[Stu] Yeah, me too.
All I can smell is fresh varnish and the timber of the box.
I can't hear anything, it's dead quiet.
As I said, I'm covered in petrol, it really stings, and it smells, um,
I don't think I'm buried.
[muttering]
Maybe this is some sort of satanic cult.
Focus, people.
Marty?
[Marty] All I know is, I'm in a box.
There's something around my feet though.
I can't see what it is, it sort of disappears underneath me.
[screaming]
Jules?
What's happening?
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello?
[phone beeping]
The rules have been broken.
So every one must be sacrificed.
Whom should I choose first?
Eenie meenie minnie mo, who will be the first to go?
Tick, tock, tick, tock.

- [knocking] - [gasps]
I've got a gun.
Who is it?
You don't have a gun, Brie, it's Gary Hart.
I know what's going on, I've spoken to Tess.
Thank God you've spoken to her.
No one's been able to get through.
I'm so glad to see you.
Brie.
What the hell's happened?
I mean the last thing I heard there's a girl's video night here, and then next thing Tess is in some box somewhere.
Oh, the warning.
She called before she read the message.
Of course she's going to call her father, she didn't know.
Now we've lost contact.
Yes, I know, I've been trying to call her.
Where are your parents?
Dad's cousin's wedding, they're staying the night.
So where was the real party?
This swish place down by the beach.
But there's nothing there, I checked.
What, nothing, no boxes, or nothing?
Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry, this wasn't meant to happen.
It was just meant to be a bit of fun.
[grunting] Fuck... [message tone beeping] [man] Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Who will be the first to go?
Shit.
[gravel crunching]
Hello?
Hey, hello?
Hey...
Hello, help.
I'm in here.
So what's all this then?
I've been getting them to tell me where they are.
Like it or not, I'm involved now.
We've already broken two rules so I better make damn sure it's worth it.
Bring me up to speed.
- Hey, hey.
- [banging] [gravel crunching]
I'm... hello?
Help, help, I need help.
Come on, please.
[whimpering] [message tone beeping]
Fuck.
Hello?
I know you're out there, help me, help me!
Help, please, help.
[man] Say a last farewell to one of your friends.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Please, my parents will pay you, I swear.
I don't care who you are, just help me.
Please, please let me out.
No.
No!
No, no, no.
Let me out, let me out.
[screaming]
Please stop!
[screaming]
- Oh, please.
- [Brie] Oh, God.
[crying]
Oh, God.
[screaming]
No!
[sobbing] [shouts] [crying]
[beeping]
Ah, who are they kidding?
[muffled sobs] [menacing laughter]
[heavy breathing]
Mother fucker.
[pop music on radio]
2-1-7 to Oak Bay, over.
[Nardine] Yes, Dane, nice music.
Yeah, we have a possible 6-1-1 in progress at Jeffrey's Point.
I am on route to investigate.
You're going to investigate someone dressed as a police officer?
Sorry, that would be um, that would be a 6... 6-0-1, I'd like to request fire services.
[Nardine] Must be one hell of a stray animal.
Nardine, I see a suspicious fire, okay?
Okay, well, that would be a 4-0-4.
How 'bout you go check it out and let me know, okay?
Yeah, yeah.
[sobbing]
[Ms. Halms] Now, luckily, the jammer I have will send all your calls and messages through your voice mail.
So I am not denying service, I am simply diverting.
[message tone beeping]
Yes, Nardine, I've got it, thank you.
Dane's on his way to the fire.
I've got to call Don Challis and get him down to the station.
Yes.
Oh, man.
Oh, geez, Louise!
[fire crackling]
[screaming]
It was stupid and...
now Ames is dead.
I woke up and called Dad, that's it.
Did you see her burn?
Stop it, Jules.
I called Dad before I got the message, what do you want me to say?
[wheezing sobs]
The fact is, Ames is dead and it's your fault.
I mean the one person who shouldn't have been called, both a cop and a parent.
She wasn't to know, I mean...
[shivering] ...her first reaction was to call her dad.
Well, now we're all fucked.
What's Hart going to do anyway?
- Is this is?
- Yeah.
It was attached to your phone line.
Looks like there are three cameras, one in the vent in the living room, one facing out the front of the house,
and this one here, in your bedroom.
Are you serious?
It's a god damn body, Nardine.
Somebody's been burned alive.
Sorry, Dane, could you repeat that please?
[coughing]
I'm about a 100 yards off Riverside Road, just before Jeffrey's Point.
I found a body.
Pretty messed up.
Look, I also found evidence of a fuel can.
The body was in a box or something.
[groans]
Man, it...
it really stinks.
It... may be my daughter.
Oh, Don...
Can I talk to him, please?
- Dane.
- Yeah.
- It's Don Challis here.
- Yeah, Don.
- Where are you?
- Just around Jeffrey's Point.
What do you see?
A box, someone's been burnt alive.
The body?
I don't know, it's burnt beyond recognition.
Is there, um...
- Is there any jewelery on her?
- I'll check.
A silver bracelet and a large ring with a gemstone.
Still can't get Marty.
[phone ringing]
Sweetheart, thank God.
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have.
Sweetheart, it was not your fault, okay?
It was not your fault.
This sick bastard has taped my inhaler inside my box, but I can't reach.
Okay, well then slow your breathing.
You've gotta slow down and calm down, please.
- Okay.
- [phone beeping]
Oh, no.
My cell's almost flat.
[crying]
Please do something, Dad, I don't wanna die here.
Sweetie, you are not going to die.
I promise, you are not going to die.
Now slow your breathing, good girl.
Now this is what I want you to do,
I want you to hang up, keep your phone on, and don't take any calls.
We need you to keep a signal.
Now, I am going to find you and you're going to be okay.
I love you, sweetie.
I love you, too, Dad.
Yes.
Right, what do we do?
I think we need Ms. Halms.
[grunting and screaming]
[panting]
[heavy breathing]
[message tone beeping]
[man] I know you're clever, but are you clever enough to save them all?
Time's running out.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Sophie.
Sergeant Hart, it's past four in the morning.
I'm sorry, but I need your help.
[phone ringing]
Kimmy?
[scoffs] I know, she is such a bitch.
She totally stubbed me today at swimming.
- Oh, hang on.
- [phone ringing]
Hey, Jules.
Oh, my God, I was just talking about you.
All good, of course.
- [Jules] Kimmy.
- What are you guys up to?
Are you making a short film or something?
What the hell are you talking about?
[Kimmy] You're like, totally all over Screen It Live.
What's going on?
[phone ringing]
Marty?
[Marty] Brie.
Thank God you're okay.
There's lots of interference.
A strong magnetic field, magnetic field or electrical field.
What, like, power interference?
- [static]
- How did you go with--
With what?
[phone line breaking up]
- Hey, I followed your email.
- Hello?
Look...
Marty, I'm going to find you.
Just sit tight.
Power transfer, power transfer.
Huh?
Say again?
Hello?
[grunts] [sighs]
[phone ringing]
- Marty?
- [Jules] Brie, it's me.
- Jules?
- It's all over the web.
- You okay?
- The bastard's got us on Screen It.
We're what?
You've gotta run Screen It, you might find us.
You've gotta find us.
The detectors are still locked up in the tech store but they should work pretty much straight out of the box.
- I'll grab a laptop.
- Can I use the phone?
Yep, just dial zero for a line out.
[phone ringing]
Oak Bay Police Department,
Nardine Walsh speaking.
Nardine, it's Gary.
We have a triple nine at my current location.
- Order a Code two QT.
- Where are you?
Reverse search this number, and be quick.
Okay.
We have to be careful, but take a look at this.
What's she doing?
What the hell is this?
- [Ms. Halms] Oh, no, no.
- Shit.
Tess, open Tess.
She's still breathing but,
I think we're running out of time.
Anybody!
Can anybody hear me?
Help!
[game beeping] [chuckles]
There's one.
And two.
Hang on, there's stuff missing.
[creaking]
Just wait here.
That you, Dane?
[Dane] Sarge?
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, follow me.
Dane, you know Sophie Halms?
- I certainly do.
- Hi, Dane.
You wouldn't believe what I just saw.
Amy Challis, we know.
Poor Ames, poor Don.
[Gary] Now, look, we got five other kids in danger, and we don't have much time.
- [Brie] Hey, Dane.
- Brie.
[phone ringing] [alarm blaring] [machine whirling] [buttons dialing]
Brie, pick up.
Pick up, Brie.
[phone ringing]
Stu.
What's going on?
Brie, can you hear me?
I'm at the mill!
I can't hear you.
[distant shouting]
What's he doing?
What's he texting or something?
Nah, it can't be.
"Mill."
He's at the sawmill.
Take one of these detectors it'll help you track him down.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Run like hell, mate, run.
[screaming] [machine powering up]
Brie, wake up Stu's dad.
[phone ringing]
[screaming] [phone ringing]
Come on, answer the phone!
[screaming]
I don't want to die!
[screaming] [sobbing]
Oh, God!
Oh, Stu!
[groaning]
[machine whirring slowly]
[splattering]
[vomiting]
Tell me where they are, Brie.
I don't know.
Well, guess.
Where in the hell are they?
I mean, can't we pull the pin on this?
No we need this site,
I'm trying to track down the IP address.
Brie, we have no idea where Tess is, right?
[Brie] Yep.
She's the one we know the least about.
I've got Marty narrowed down to, like, half a dozen possible places.
And with Jules, um,
I know it's smelly and dark, there are roaches, it could be a warehouse, or...
And Kyle...
I think Kyle's either in a tank or a sewer, some kind of fresh water.
Narrows it down a bit, right?
Okay, let's play the numbers.
Water treatment plant?
- The reservoir?
- No, too remote.
He only had three hours to place 'em all.
That's assuming there's only one of them.
Yeah.
Think about it, Amy was burnt down by the old Jetty.
She's the only smoker in our group and her dad's the fire chief.
That can't be a coincidence.
Stu was at his dad's mill.
There's a connection with them all.
What's the motive?
Right now we don't have time for motive.
Kyle's a swimmer, a swimmer.
Okay, well, there are three pools in town.
The Olympic, the Riverside.
And Oak Bay High.
I'll be right back.
Get Dane down to the other two.
- What about Stu?
- It's about the living.
I've been watching this all night.
Check this out.
Kyle!
Kyle, can you hear me?
[static interference] [beeping]
[rapid beeping]
Macka.
[screaming]
[gasps]
Jules.
- [electricity buzzing] - [groaning]
What the hell was that?
[beeping]
[Macka] What the...?
[sirens blaring]
[shivering] [gasping]
Kyle?
[Kyle] Help!
[Brie] She's in some kind of dumpster somewhere.
That explains the roaches and the smell,
I don't know why I didn't realize before, I'm such a--
The bindings on my legs, they are electrodes.
That would explain the interference.
[grunting]
Marty, hang on.
- Chief.
- What have you got?
I know where Marty is.
You'd better hurry.
Screen It's saying Kyle's gone.
Is Ms. Halms all right?
Okay, let's get out of here.
[gasping] [grunting]
[Dane] Kyle.
[gasping]
You're okay now, Sophie.
In you hop, sweetheart.
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.
Look after her, fellas.
Weird, buddy, weird.
[phone ringing]
Jules, I know where you are, we're on our way.
[Jules] Brie, please hurry.
Jules?
[Gary] Dane, I think it's Macka.
He's using his phone as some sort of trigger device.
So treat it as a weapon.
- [Dane] Copy that, sarge.
- [Gary] Be careful, okay?
[Dane] Yeah, don't worry.
[Gary] Nardine, Brie's found Jules at Springs Mall, she's heading there now.
[Nardine] Oh, great, do I still have to be careful?
No, it's too late for that now, whoever did this knows we know.
- Yeah, but--
- I said it's too late, all right?
- [electric zapping]
- Ah, Jesus!
Marty?
Hey, hey, yeah.
Marty Pollock, it's Gary Hart, can you hear me?
[distant shouting]
Sarge!
[Gary] I can hear you.
[shouting]
I just have to find a way in.
Off peak power switches over at six!
Sarge!
God.
I'm here, Marty, I'm here.
You okay?
Sure I am, get me out of this fucking box.
[grunting]
[crying]
[screaming] Please, please, I'm in here, stop!
Please!
[screaming]
Please, I'm in here!
I'm in here!
Please!
[screaming]
- [tires screeching]
- Stop, stop!
Shut it down!
Shut it down, there's someone in there!
Help!
Jules, hang on!
Oh, God, call an ambulance!
Oh, Jules...
Do it!
It's okay, I'm coming.
Jules!
[chuckles]
You're all right, pal, you're okay.
I'll see you soon.
Charging.
[beeping]
Stay clear.
[man] Got a pulse.
[Gary] Don, it's Gary Hart here, mate.
[Don] Hello, Gary.
Look, I'm way under-maned and I need your help.
[Don] Sure.
I've got on APB out on Rodney MacNamara,
Macka from the school.
I need you to check his place out for me please.
[Don] No worries.
[sirens blaring]
[buttons dialing]
- Brie.
- [Brie] She's at the cemetery.
All the lines, they make a pentagram,
I've worked out the exact center, she's at the cemetery.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it all makes sense, none of this is random.
The golden ratio, smart thinking.
I saw Macka before, in the school van.
He's not smart enough to do all this.
Yeah, maybe not alone, but he's our only suspect.
- [Gary] Marty.
- Yeah?
[Gary] You go back and wait for Brie okay?
- [Marty] Yeah.
- [Don] Gary, he's not there.
Matthew's not there.
Dane, you keep an eye out for him.
Follow me I know exactly where she is.
This has been moved, give me a hand, Don.
- What?
- Give me a hand.
Push, mate, push.
[grunting]
[screaming]
- Let me go!
- Tell them it wasn't me, Brie.
[muffled screaming]
You really think I'm smart enough to pull this shit off?
Do you?
Marty!
Brie!
Brie, oh, no.
Push!
Push!
Tess...!
Tess, sweetheart.
Give me a hand here, give me a hand.
[grunting]
Lift it up, lift!
Teabird, Teabird, Teabird it's okay.
I saw it on Screen It.
Macka, put your weapon down.
Come on, put it down, Macka.
It'll explain everything, shut up.
- It's okay.
- Macka put the phone down!
- Don't!
- You'll get a chance.
- Don't shoot!
- No, you have to tell them now!
[gun firing]
- [grunts]
- Jesus.
Brie?
[sobbing]
Oh, shit.
- My baby...
- Oh, Jesus.
[sobbing] My beautiful baby.
[sobbing]
My baby girl.
[acoustic music playing]
[sobbing]
* I can't say goodbye
* 'Cause no matter how hard I try *
* I can't comprehend that you're not all still here *
* I can't let you go
* 'Cause deep inside I know
* That there's nothing I can do *
* You're all just gone
* You're gone
* You're all gone
* Why did you have to feel?
* And why did I have to see?
* This should never have happened *
* Why couldn't it have been me?
*
* And it won't be okay
* I'll see you everyday but I know *
* That somehow I've gotta find a way *
* To let it go for you
* To forgive the circumstance
* To give heaven half a chance *
* To let them carry you freely off into the distance *
* Maybe this was just your time *
[Brie] Hey, Jules, how are you?
[Jules] I'm all right.
[Brie] How's Kyle?
[Jules] Still no change.
[Brie] He's strong, Jules, he'll pull through.
[Jules] Brie, what if they stare?
[Brie] It'll be all right.
You're the queen of Oak Bay.
[Jules] Yeah, on my permanent throne.
Morning, Mr. Freeman.
[Mr. Freeman] Hi, Brie.
Nice chair.
The hospital one was so chunky.
- Have a good day.
- See you after rehab.
- So, surfing the web last night.
- Yeah?
Apparently, some guys have a real fetish for amputees.
[laughing]
A bit of stumpy-rumpy-pumpy?
Gross.
So, I saw your story on TV last night.
They've been pestering me for weeks.
Hey, Tina.
Hey, Chantelle.
[clears throat] [woman] Jules Freeman?
- Have you got a moment?
- [Jules] Oh, God.
[Brie] Jules, I'll get rid of them, don't worry.
Oh, sorry, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
[voices echoing]
Yeah, I'm fine.
Better than your brother.
Well, what can I say, he was always a bit messed up.
You just never really knew when he was gonna snap.
But I guess it's good he's gone.
You know, so he doesn't try and take the other leg.
You can only hope that this isn't hereditary.
[voices echoing]
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
[slow tempo song plays]
* I'm being followed by my shadow *
* He's been creeping around
* Asking where I've been
* He keeps tapping on my shoulder *
* Telling me it's over
* So where do I begin?
* These dark days are getting harder *
* I feel I'm treading water
* So will I sink or swim?
* Roll on, push a little further *
* I keep saying is this worth it *
* Or should I just give in?
* I don't know
* I don't know which way I'm supposed to spin *
* In this circle
* And I won't waste my time on your concern *
* 'Til it's over
* I look back on a distant border *
* I fear I'm getting older
* There's so much that I missed *
* Walk on following a fate line *
* See if I can define
* Where I came undone
* I don't know which way I'm supposed to spin *
* In this circle
* And I won't waste my time on your concern *
* 'Til it's over
* And I will wait my turn
* My time will come
* This ain't over
* And I can't wait no more
* No sweet return
* This is over
* So it is
* No sweet return
* So it is
* No sweet return
* So it is
* No sweet return
* So it is
* No sweet return
* This is over
* In your face now
* Life's no drag now
* Movin' faster
* Through tomorrow
* I'm riding high again
* This dream of mine just never ends *
* I'm coming back let's not pretend *
* Come on, come on
* Can't hold me back, won't hold me back *
* No, no, no, no
* I'm back on track
* Can't hold me back, don't hold me back *
* No, no, no, no
* Can't
* Hold me back
Uh-huh, yeah.
Okay, lover boy.
I'll see you in second period.
Hey, bitch.
And don't you forget it, bitch.
Us bitches gotta stick together right?
Yes, we do.
So what is the collective noun for a group of bitches?
- A flock?
- A gaggle.
- A platoon.
- A swarm.
Oh, I know, a herd.
Oh, yeah, thanks, makes us sound like a bunch of cows.
Moo, baby.
You little shit.
Aww, so sorry, did I invade your personal space?
Here, let me help.
I don't want your fucking help.
Very immature, guys.
"She touched me, like no guy has ever."
Jealous much?
Jesus, there's a case for selective breeding.
Little shit's too big for his boots.
Needs respect.
What the fuck are you looking at Chantelle?
Shit he scratched my phone.
Did you get another new phone?
Yeah, it's a bit chunky but shiny, touch.
It's only like three months old.
I got her old iPhone.
Yay.
Wow, it's impressive.
And it's shiny and has pretty pictures.
Oh, and YouTube.
Most phones have YouTube.
Hello, shiny, pretty pictures.
Oh, my God.
So are we still on for tonight?
Yeah, totally, Kyle is coming.
Already?
Yeah, I've heard that about him.
Won't see much of you two then.
I hope not, nothing personal.
Has anyone spoken to Tess?
Yeah, she's totally in, and Stu of course.
- What about Marty?
- Yeah, what about Marty?
We were just talking about you.
And a hot and steamy dream Brie had about you.
Do tell.
Well, you were both lying naked inserting your memory sticks into each others USB ports.
Ew geek porn.
I'm impressed.
I didn't--
That Jules knows what a USB is.
You're right, my God, the nerd gene is contagious.
And the geek shall inherit the earth.
Thought that was cockroaches.
Besides, haven't you heard, geek is the new chic.
- Is that the new N97?
- I hear it has Maemo 6.1.
Bluetooth three plus.
Yeah, and pretty pictures.
Why do I hang with you dorks again?
Intelligence by association.
Comic value maybe?
You're secretly a geek.
You own more gadgets than anyone I know.
That's not a geek, that's Daddy's little Princess.
Hello, I'm right here.
Perhaps try insulting me when I'm not around.
If you insist.
Ah, thanks.
Enjoy the intellectual stimulation of media.
Later bitches.
Why do we hang out with her again?
I don't know.
Jules is okay.
Come on, guys, you know the rules, pop your phone in the box.
Thank you.
Bonjour, mon cheri.
Thank you.
Good morning, class.
Good morning, Ms. Halms.
Now some of you may have noticed that we no longer have cell phone coverage in this classroom.
Oh, what?
And we will be implementing and enforcing a ban on phones in class as in exam conditions.
You have been warned.
Now, luckily, the jammer I have will send all of your calls and messages through to your voice mail, so I'm not denying service I'm simply diverting.
Although, I wasn't expecting such a quick response.
- Hand it over, Mr. Pollock.
- Me?
I, I've been warned.
As you seem to have such a keen interest in this, you won't mind joining me over term break to help tighten up the protocol.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
See me after class.
And your Dad's cool?
I was just honest with him.
We have an understanding, he keeps me on a long leash, and I won't bite.
Oh, smart man.
He was overprotective for awhile you know, after mum.
Here it is.
YouTube's finest.
Oh, much amusement at the expense of others.
A personal favorite of mine.
Well you have to dig for gold among the Star Wars fan movies and foolish teens flashing their bits.
You know Marty's thinking of web-casting our party on Screen-It.
I thought that got shut down.
After that bully-bash thing?
Apparently not.
So where is this place again?
I don't know, some swanky beach-house
Jules found out about.
Marty was going to send everyone the location but I'll text him.
So when are the semi-naked guys going to writhe wet and exposed for us girls hey?
- Hit the showers girls.
- Here they come, go Kyle.
Come on, my baby.
Go Kyle show us what you got.
We all know what you've got Kimmy.
We've seen the videos.
Bitch.
Remember what we practiced, focus on the catch.
Watch the streamlining, 24 straight, qualify first.
Come on.
On your marks, get set.
Beautiful.
Come on, Kyle.
Go, son!
Go, Kyle.
That's it, come on.
Do you think Kyle's dad's kind of hot?
Come on, push.
Yeah, in like a prison guard sort of way.
Come on!
I'd do him.
Come on, son, go!
Yes!
Ah, for christ sake.
Macka!
Oi, what do you think you're doing, you can't work here.
- Macka, get out here!
- I'll deal with you later.
- Macka!
- My poor baby was robbed.
- Hold your horses.
- Well, what the hell are you doing?
- What?
- Well, look at the clock!
- Yeah, and?
- It's still going isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Well, it shouldn't be.
Once they fix the timer and re-calibrate, we'll re-run it tomorrow.
Now on your bike, fix it.
Stay in the pool.
Haven't you got class Miss Freeman?
Some people would say I have a lot of class.
Hey, didn't Mike used to coach Macka or something?
Um, yep they had a falling out.
- Drugs.
- Ohh.
Punches were thrown, blood was let, usual macho bullshit.
Before or after his, the drink-driving thing?
- Just before.
- Wow, sounds complicated, girl.
Let's go.
* I've been batting back a secret *
* For whenever you're around
* I feel my heart begin to race *
* And both my feet lift off the ground *
* It's like I'm floating in slow motion *
* High above our sleepy town
* And I've been trying not to notice *
* It's a long way down
Hey, Dane.
- What's up?
- What's up?
You very well know what's up, Miss Wisemann.
No helmet, reckless driving, that little stunt you pulled back there through the park.
Come on, don't be a stiff.
A girl's gotta have some fun.
Besides, hey, I can handle myself.
I'm sure you can, look, just put a helmet on, you know, and set a good example and all.
Oh, like you?
Go on, get outta here.
Aw, come on.
Hello?
Hello.
- Good one, Kyle.
- What?
Aww, Brisie-poo.
Shut up.
You should have seen your face.
Wow, couldn't have found anywhere a little more--
- Vulgar?
- Discrete?
Who owns this place?
Apparently they're O.S. Jules got a tip-off.
That's not the only tip Jules is getting off.
Oh, God.
Brie, just chuck your stuff in the kitchen.
I reckon it will just be the guys, hang on.
I'll get it.
Hey.
Jesus, you guys scared the shit out of me.
Anyone would think you're breaking the law or something.
Don't tell your dad.
- Hi.
- Hiya.
- Hey, how are you going?
- Good, let's get shit faced.
Let's.
Wow.
Tada.
Are they started already?
Ah, get a room you two, honestly.
Now that's a good idea.
Hey, you.
Found their password yet?
Idiots.
- Hey, bro.
- Tess, let me get you a drink.
It's been awhile man, how's things at the mill?
You know, same old.
Old man's still busting my balls.
Yeah it's a bummer you had to drop out.
- Hey, beverage?
- Brought my own mixer.
Oh, how obliging.
I saw your slice and dice stunt on Screen-It.
Yeah, some roadkill I found.
Frozen solid then put it through the big kahuna blade.
- Instant anatomy lesson.
- Yeah, hey, got it up.
Look, look, look, look, look.
Shut up back there okay just, fuck off, okay.
- Oh, God.
- Okay, let's do it.
You're a sick man.
It gets better.
It doesn't even have a heart.
Wait for it, wait for it.
You did not just do that.
Can't believe I watched that.
Seriously, we, no.
Marty, load these up, more PG friendly.
- Ugh.
- I'm gonna be scared for life.
We are wired and ready to roll.
These should up the party ante.
You're a bad girl, Jules.
This is pretty hard-core, huh?
This is some serious setup dude.
Everything controlled by my trusty mobile.
I've got my whole house setup back home.
Hey which one do you wanna start with?
Crazy Japanese Show.
Oh, my God, I love that show.
Hey have guys seen the J-Pop girls?
Speed?
- Yes.
- It's so tacky it's delicious.
- How good is it.
- That is cool.
Hey are we all set to live-cast our party later?
All set to Screen-It.
Hey, guys, get closer, let's immortalize the crime.
Let's do it.
That's going straight to Facebook.
Time to get off your face-book.
Hey, that was awesome, but that takes time so here's one I prepared earlier.
Uh-huh.
Hey, pizza's here.
- Pizza!
- Ah, pizza.
Kyle, it's your dad man, your dad.
I diverted my phone, come on.
Everyone shut the fuck up.
Pollock residence.
Hi, Helen, it's Mike Gruper here.
Hi, Mike, I suppose you're after Kyle.
They're playing games upstairs, hang on.
That is fucking wild.
- Shh.
- How did you do that?
I hacked an automated SKYPE message bank app.
Shut up, shut up.
All right.
Hi, Dad, what's up?
You checking' up on me?
Well, what do you think after what happened in the pool today?
Look, just wanted to remind you we have a 6:00AM start tomorrow, so don't stay up all night playing games.
Okay, Dad, is that it?
Okay, now I expect a PB tomorrow.
Okay, Dad.
Can I go now?
I'll see you in the morning.
- That is cool.
- What!
The things you can do with open-source code and Bluetooth.
I think I'll have that joint now.
That's tweet-worthy even.
It's like the modern equivalent of a forged note.
I think I'll join you.
What about your PB tomorrow?
Tomorrow, I'm going for a PB tonight.
No smoking inside, okay?
Go out back.
Yes, mom.
Sorry.
Coming?
It's not my thing.
Asthma's a bitch.
Better get you shit-faced then.
Oh, my God, they've got a pool.
- What?
- Come on!
* Na na na na na na na na na *
* Watch out your mummy's eyes
* Better make up good lies
* Sneak away from home
* It's time for the sunshine drive *
* Don't care about your money
* Don't care about your honey
* Boys are in a queue
* It's time for the sunshine drive *
* First stop frozen tequila
* Second stop Melbourne bitter *
* Third stop cowboy cocksucker *
* Oh, yeah
* Gabba, gabba, hey, Kat, get right *
* It's time for the sunshine drive *
* Hey, Lucy, get spazzy
* It's time for the sunshine drive *
* Hey, Ally, don't worry
* It's time for the sunshine drive *
* We're the Spazzys and we're ready *
* Let's go to the sunshine drive *
* Na na na na na na na na na
So sexy...
Oh, dude, this is the song they sing, oh...
Oh.
Shh.
This is how we party Oak Bay style.
Marty?
Anyone?
Hello?
Ha-ha, very funny.
Quit messing around, guys.
Hey, Brie.
What?
Marty, you're such a jerk.
Marty?
Jules?
Stu?
Where are you guys?
Six blind mice, no where to run.
Who'll be the first one to start crying...
Marty?
...when they discover they're all going to die?
Oh, dear, poor little mice.
The fate of your friends is in your hands, Brie.
- Marty?
- If you're clever enough, and if you play by the rules, no parents, no authorities.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
What?
The number you have dialed is currently switched off or not in a mobile serviced area.
Please call again later.
Guys?
Daddy.
Ow.
Ow.
Hey, you got me.
That's going to leave a good welt on my head.
Guys, hey.
Can you hear me?
The number you have dialed is currently switched off or not in a mobile serviced area.
What?
Jesus.
Hey, can you hear me?
Hey.
Hey!
Help.
Guys?
What the fuck is going on?
Hello?
Kyle, you wanker.
Hello.
Are you enjoying this little game?
- What the fuck?
- I know I am.
By the way, there are only two rules in this game.
Rule number one, no parents.
Rule number two, no authorities.
- Listen here, you little shit.
- Simple isn't it?
Have fun.
Breezer?
It's kind of late isn't it?
Yeah, well, must have lost track of time.
Are you okay?
Have you been drinking?
No, no, God no.
I've been at Jules' place.
But Jules' place is on Carlson Road.
I took the scenic route.
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna follow you home and make sure you get there safe.
Dane, look I'm fine, honestly.
Look, I'm going to do this.
I'm not gonna ask any questions, capiche?
Daddy!
Uh...
it sounds kind of hollow.
Bye, Brie.
Hey, hey, hang on, you're breaking up.
I think the door closer is interfering or something.
Brie, I wouldn't mess around with this sort of shit, okay?
I really am in some sort of box.
I got this freaky video...
Hello?
Brie?
Hi.
Brie... check this out.
- Holy shit, you're in a box.
- No shit, Sherlock.
How?
I don't get it, we were--
Look I am freaking out here, you have to find me.
I woke up in that house all alone and you guys had gone.
What am I going to do?
I have no fucking idea.
The last thing...
Oh, my God.
I don't remember.
Um, okay, something odd is going on here.
I have erratic phone coverage and there is no data connection,
I'm surprised the MMS got through.
Marty, what am I supposed to do?
Did you get the other message?
The smiley face thing with you guys all in boxes?
Yeah, I though that was a joke, I thought you--
Brie, hey, whoa, whoa, hey all... wait, all of us?
Yeah my message said the fate of your friends is in your hands.
Friends as in plural.
And then it had a montage of images of you guys all in boxes.
Oh, God, this is real.
That's different to mine.
Send it to me.
What the hell's going on?
Brie, we need you.
You know, I knew something was up, you'd never leave your lappy and your PS3 behind.
At least you're safe.
Hey, listen, tell the others not to use video call, it chews through the battery and we need--
Hello?
Hello?
Brie.
The number you have dialed is currently switched off or not in a mobile--
Hey.
Hey.
- Tess?
- Dad, you've gotta help me.
What do ya mean sweetheart, what's going on?
I don't know, I just woke up and I'm locked in a box.
I'm so scared.
What do you mean you're locked in a box?
What are you... sweetheart, have you been taking drugs or something?
Um...
I was at a party and I don't know what happened.
I don't remember anything.
Hang on, hang on, just calm down.
So you're telling me that you were at a party and someone put you in a box.
I mean can't you get out of it?
What is it, a cardboard box or what?
No, it's like a wooden box.
I really don't know what happened, Dad.
It smells funny, it's musty.
- So you're telling me--
- Just hang on a second, okay?
I've got a message, I'm gonna put you on hold.
It might be the others.
Others, sweetheart what do you mean by--
There are only two rules in this game.
Rule number one, no parents.
Rule number two, no authorities.
Simple isn't it?
Have fun.
This better not be a joke, young lady.
I do hope you like the perfume you're wearing.
It's the very best, it will light up your day.
Hello, help me.
Oak Bay police department, Nardine Walsh speaking.
Hey, Dad.
Nardine, it's Gary, just hang on a sec will you?
Sweetheart?
- Dad, I've messed up.
- Hey, hey, slow down.
Please tell me you didn't call anyone.
No, I haven't, but I've got Nardine on the other phone.
No, no, no, you can't tell anybody.
Okay.
Seriously, you can't tell anybody.
Okay, okay, I get it.
Just hang on, hang on.
Nardine, I'm sorry, just a false alarm.
Turns out Tess is at a friend's place.
You want Dane to go and check on 'em?
No, no, I'll go and pick her up now.
Things we do for our kids, eh, sarge?
You know, my Philip--
Yeah, wouldn't want it any other way.
Look, nothing unusual to report down there, everything okay?
It's been quiet actually.
A bit bored really,
I've been trying to get on the internet but--
Right, right, good, well, I've gotta go.
We did have one...
Hello?
- Sweetheart?
- Dad, it's all right.
I'm okay.
From the start, tell me what the message said.
No, dammit, Jules, you can't call your dad.
They might be listening.
I mean how do we even know this is real?
How can they be monitoring all of our calls, it's crazy.
Do you wanna take that risk?
Think, Jules.
Have you spoken to the others?
I spoke briefly to Amy.
Oh, so you call her before you call your girlfriend.
She called me.
She said she could smell petrol,
I told her not to use her phone, it could cause a spark.
The petrol's burning my skin.
Kyle said not to make anymore calls, but I'm so scared.
I mean, why the fuck would they cover me in petrol, Brie?
Just, sit tight Ames, okay?
Marty said to get us all on a conference call, rather than everyone wasting precious battery life calling each other.
Well, I think my credit's low.
Just hurry up, okay?
Please hurry up.
I'm trying, all right?
I don't...
I...
You need to calm down, I'd gladly swap positions.
I can't.
Bullshit.
Of course you can.
Don't sell yourself short, you are stronger than you think.
It's what I dig about you.
Okay.
Say it with gusto.
Okay!
Thank God.
Now, you realize it's you and me.
No one else is going to get us out of this.
So you need to focus.
Yeah, I tried, the only other person I can get through to is Kyle.
He said his is wet.
Mine just smells.
It's like I'm buried, but there's light coming through.
Smelly?
Are you serious?
I'm basted and ready to cook here.
It's not all about you Ames.
There's bigger picture stuff going on here.
Hey, I've been trying to call.
Have you heard from Tess?
No, her line's busy.
Breezer's still trying.
We're going to do a conference hookup thing and figure this out, so keep the line free.
Man, I don't remember anything after those pills.
Just stay cool, we'll talk in a minute.
Hey, I was gonna call my cousin, he's into technology and stuff and I thought he might be able to find us using some triangulation shit.
Don't call anyone yet, just keep it together, man.
- You wanna see it?
- Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
Wait, what's that, what's that?
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah.
Dude, come on, click.
Yeah, okay, okay.
Still can't get on to Tess, but Marty and I thought it was imperative that we're all brought up to speed.
Up to speed?
We're all fucked, is that up to speed enough for you?
Let her speak.
For all we know Brie's in on this shit.
What makes her so special not to get fucking taken.
- Shut up, Jules.
- Yeah, shut up.
I think we all realize this is either some sick prank or something freaky is going on.
You got that right.
I'm covered in fucking petrol.
Okay, we're gonna go around, um, systematically, one by one, and you tell me what you see, what you smell,
- stuff like that.
- We're wasting time.
How the fuck else do you think we are going to work this out unless we get all our info sorted, huh?
We should call the cops and take the risk.
Last time I checked cops were filed under authorities.
Use your head for once in your perfect little life.
Okay, okay, Jules.
Marty's right.
We all have to calm down.
Oh, that's fine for you, Brie, you're not the one in a fucking box.
My box is damp.
It's leaking, there's water in the bottom.
I'm laying in a few centimeters of water.
Um, I can't hear much but I don't know,
I could be in a sewer.
I think I'm floating.
Okay, good.
Either way, I'm definitely not out in the open.
Yeah, me too.
All I can smell is fresh varnish and the timber of the box.
I can't hear anything, it's dead quiet.
As I said, I'm covered in petrol, it really stings, and it smells, um,
I don't think I'm buried.
Maybe this is some sort of satanic cult.
Focus, people.
Marty?
All I know is, I'm in a box.
There's something around my feet though.
I can't see what it is, it sort of disappears underneath me.
Jules?
What's happening?
Hello?
Is anyone there?
Hello?
The rules have been broken.
So every one must be sacrificed.
Whom should I choose first?
Eenie meenie minnie mo, who will be the first to go?
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Fuck.
Fuck off.
Little fucking bastards.
Oh, that's just lovely.
I've got a gun.
Who is it?
You don't have a gun, Brie, it's Gary Hart.
I know what's going on, I've spoken to Tess.
Thank God you've spoken to her.
No one's been able to get through.
I'm so glad to see you.
Brie.
What the hell's happened?
I mean the last thing I heard there's a girl's video night here, and then next thing Tess is in some box somewhere.
Oh, the warning.
She called before she read the message.
Of course she's going to call her father, she didn't know.
Now we've lost contact.
Yes, I know, I've been trying to call her.
Where are your parents?
Dad's cousin's wedding, they're staying the night.
So where was the real party?
This swish place down by the beach.
But there's nothing there, I checked.
What, nothing, no boxes, or nothing?
Nothing.
Look, I'm sorry, this wasn't meant to happen.
It was just meant to be a bit of fun.
Fuck...
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Who will be the first to go?
Shit.
Hello?
Hey, hello?
Hey...
Hello, help.
I'm in here.
So what's all this then?
I've been getting them to tell me where they are.
Like it or not, I'm involved now.
We've already broken two rules so I better make damn sure it's worth it.
Bring me up to speed.
Hey, hey.
I'm... hello?
Help, help, I need help.
Come on, please.
Fuck.
Hello?
I know you're out there, help me, help me!
Help, please, help.
Say a last farewell to one of your friends.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Please, my parents will pay you, I swear.
I don't care who you are, just help me.
Please, please let me out.
No.
No!
No, no, no.
Let me out, let me out.
Please stop!
- Oh, please.
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
No!
Ah, who are they kidding?
Mother fucker.
2-1-7 to Oak Bay, over.
Yes, Dane, nice music.
Yeah, we have a possible 6-1-1 in progress at Jeffrey's Point.
I am on route to investigate.
You're going to investigate someone dressed as a police officer?
Sorry, that would be um, that would be a 6... 6-0-1, I'd like to request fire services.
Must be one hell of a stray animal.
Nardine, I see a suspicious fire, okay?
Okay, well, that would be a 4-0-4.
How 'bout you go check it out and let me know, okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Now, luckily, the jammer I have will send all your calls and messages through your voice mail.
So I am not denying service, I am simply diverting.
Yes, Nardine, I've got it, thank you.
Dane's on his way to the fire.
I've got to call Don Challis and get him down to the station.
Yes.
Oh, man.
Oh, geez, Louise!
It was stupid and...
now Ames is dead.
I woke up and called Dad, that's it.
Did you see her burn?
Stop it, Jules.
I called Dad before I got the message, what do you want me to say?
The fact is, Ames is dead and it's your fault.
I mean the one person who shouldn't have been called, both a cop and a parent.
She wasn't to know, I mean her first reaction was to call her dad.
Well, now we're all fucked.
What's Hart going to do anyway?
- Is this is?
- Yeah.
It was attached to your phone line.
Looks like there are three cameras, one in the vent in the living room, one facing out the front of the house,
and this one here, in your bedroom.
Are you serious?
It's a god damn body, Nardine.
Somebody's been burned alive.
Sorry, Dane, could you repeat that please?
I'm about a 100 yards off Riverside Road, just before Jeffrey's Point.
I found a body.
Pretty messed up.
Look, I also found evidence of a fuel can.
The body was in a box or something.
Man, it...
it really stinks.
It... may be my daughter.
Oh, Don...
Can I talk to him, please?
- Dane.
- Yeah.
- It's Don Challis here.
- Yeah, Don.
- Where are you?
- Just around Jeffrey's Point.
What do you see?
A box, someone's been burnt alive.
The body?
I don't know, it's burnt beyond recognition.
Is there, um...
- Is there any jewelery on her?
- I'll check.
A silver bracelet and a large ring with a gemstone.
Still can't get Marty.
Sweetheart, thank God.
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have.
Sweetheart, it was not your fault, okay?
It was not your fault.
This sick bastard has taped my inhaler inside my box, but I can't reach.
Okay, well then slow your breathing.
You've gotta slow down and calm down, please.
Okay.
Oh, no.
My cell's almost flat.
Please do something, Dad, I don't wanna die here.
Sweetie, you are not going to die.
I promise, you are not going to die.
Now slow your breathing, good girl.
Now this is what I want you to do,
I want you to hang up, keep your phone on, and don't take any calls.
We need you to keep a signal.
Now, I am going to find you and you're going to be okay.
I love you, sweetie.
I love you, too, Dad.
Yes.
Right, what do we do?
I think we need Ms. Halms.
I know you're clever, but are you clever enough to save them all?
Time's running out.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
Sophie.
Sergeant Hart, it's past four in the morning.
I'm sorry, but I need your help.
Kimmy?
I know, she is such a bitch.
She totally stubbed me today at swimming.
Oh, hang on.
Hey, Jules.
Oh, my God, I was just talking about you.
All good, of course.
- Kimmy.
- What are you guys up to?
Are you making a short film or something?
What the hell are you talking about?
You're like, totally all over Screen It Live.
What's going on?
Marty?
Brie.
Thank God you're okay.
There's lots of interference.
A strong magnetic field, magnetic field or electrical field.
What, like, power interference?
How did you go with--
With what?
- Hey, I followed your email.
- Hello?
Look...
Marty, I'm going to find you.
Just sit tight.
Power transfer, power transfer.
Huh?
Say again?
Hello?
- Marty?
- Brie, it's me.
- Jules?
- It's all over the web.
- You okay?
- The bastard's got us on Screen It.
We're what?
You've gotta run Screen It, you might find us.
You've gotta find us.
The detectors are still locked up in the tech store but they should work pretty much straight out of the box.
- I'll grab a laptop.
- Can I use the phone?
Yep, just dial zero for a line out.
Oak Bay Police Department,
Nardine Walsh speaking.
Nardine, it's Gary.
We have a triple nine at my current location.
- Order a Code two QT.
- Where are you?
Reverse search this number, and be quick.
Okay.
We have to be careful, but take a look at this.
What's she doing?
What the hell is this?
- Oh, no, no.
- Shit.
Tess, open Tess.
She's still breathing but,
I think we're running out of time.
Anybody!
Can anybody hear me?
Help!
There's one.
And two.
Hang on, there's stuff missing.
Just wait here.
That you, Dane?
Sarge?
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, follow me.
Dane, you know Sophie Halms?
- I certainly do.
- Hi, Dane.
You wouldn't believe what I just saw.
Amy Challis, we know.
Poor Ames, poor Don.
Now, look, we got five other kids in danger, and we don't have much time.
- Hey, Dane.
- Brie.
Brie, pick up.
Pick up, Brie.
Stu.
What's going on?
Brie, can you hear me?
I'm at the mill!
I can't hear you.
What's he doing?
What's he texting or something?
Nah, it can't be.
"Mill."
He's at the sawmill.
Take one of these detectors it'll help you track him down.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Run like hell, mate, run.
Brie, wake up Stu's dad.
Come on, answer the phone!
I don't want to die!
Oh, God!
Oh, Stu!
Tell me where they are, Brie.
I don't know.
Well, guess.
Where in the hell are they?
I mean, can't we pull the pin on this?
No we need this site,
I'm trying to track down the IP address.
Brie, we have no idea where Tess is, right?
Yep.
She's the one we know the least about.
I've got Marty narrowed down to, like, half a dozen possible places.
And with Jules, um,
I know it's smelly and dark, there are roaches, it could be a warehouse, or...
And Kyle...
I think Kyle's either in a tank or a sewer, some kind of fresh water.
Narrows it down a bit, right?
Okay, let's play the numbers.
Water treatment plant?
- The reservoir?
- No, too remote.
He only had three hours to place 'em all.
That's assuming there's only one of them.
Yeah.
Think about it, Amy was burnt down by the old Jetty.
She's the only smoker in our group and her dad's the fire chief.
That can't be a coincidence.
Stu was at his dad's mill.
There's a connection with them all.
What's the motive?
Right now we don't have time for motive.
Kyle's a swimmer, a swimmer.
Okay, well, there are three pools in town.
The Olympic, the Riverside.
And Oak Bay High.
I'll be right back.
Get Dane down to the other two.
- What about Stu?
- It's about the living.
I've been watching this all night.
Check this out.
Kyle!
Kyle, can you hear me?
Macka.
Jules.
What the hell was that?
What the...?
Kyle?
Help!
She's in some kind of dumpster somewhere.
That explains the roaches and the smell,
I don't know why I didn't realize before, I'm such a--
The bindings on my legs, they are electrodes.
That would explain the interference.
Marty, hang on.
- Chief.
- What have you got?
I know where Marty is.
You'd better hurry.
Screen It's saying Kyle's gone.
Is Ms. Halms all right?
Okay, let's get out of here.
Kyle.
You're okay now, Sophie.
In you hop, sweetheart.
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.
Look after her, fellas.
Weird, buddy, weird.
Jules, I know where you are, we're on our way.
Brie, please hurry.
Jules?
Dane, I think it's Macka.
He's using his phone as some sort of trigger device.
So treat it as a weapon.
- Copy that, sarge.
- Be careful, okay?
Yeah, don't worry.
Nardine, Brie's found Jules at Springs Mall, she's heading there now.
Oh, great, do I still have to be careful?
No, it's too late for that now, whoever did this knows we know.
- Yeah, but--
- I said it's too late, all right?
Ah, Jesus!
Marty?
Hey, hey, yeah.
Marty Pollock, it's Gary Hart, can you hear me?
Sarge!
I can hear you.
I just have to find a way in.
Off peak power switches over at six!
Sarge!
God.
I'm here, Marty, I'm here.
You okay?
Sure I am, get me out of this fucking box.
Please, please, I'm in here, stop!
Please!
Please, I'm in here!
I'm in here!
Please!
Stop, stop!
Shut it down!
Shut it down, there's someone in there!
Help!
Jules, hang on!
Oh, God, call an ambulance!
Oh, Jules...
Do it!
It's okay, I'm coming.
Jules!
You're all right, pal, you're okay.
I'll see you soon.
Charging.
Stay clear.
Got a pulse.
Don, it's Gary Hart here, mate.
Hello, Gary.
Look, I'm way under-maned and I need your help.
Sure.
I've got on APB out on Rodney MacNamara,
Macka from the school.
I need you to check his place out for me please.
No worries.
- Brie.
- She's at the cemetery.
All the lines, they make a pentagram,
I've worked out the exact center, she's at the cemetery.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it all makes sense, none of this is random.
The golden ratio, smart thinking.
I saw Macka before, in the school van.
He's not smart enough to do all this.
Yeah, maybe not alone, but he's our only suspect.
- Marty.
- Yeah?
You go back and wait for Brie okay?
- Yeah.
- Gary, he's not there.
Matthew's not there.
Dane, you keep an eye out for him.
Follow me I know exactly where she is.
This has been moved, give me a hand, Don.
- What?
- Give me a hand.
Push, mate, push.
- Let me go!
- Tell them it wasn't me, Brie.
You really think I'm smart enough to pull this shit off?
Do you?
Marty!
Brie!
Brie, oh, no.
Push!
Push!
Tess...!
Tess, sweetheart.
Give me a hand here, give me a hand.
Lift it up, lift!
Teabird, Teabird, Teabird it's okay.
I saw it on Screen It.
Macka, put your weapon down.
Come on, put it down, Macka.
It'll explain everything, shut up.
- It's okay.
- Macka put the phone down!
- Don't!
- You'll get a chance.
- Don't shoot!
- No, you have to tell them now!
Jesus.
Brie?
Oh, shit.
- My baby...
- Oh, Jesus.
My beautiful baby.
My baby girl.
* I can't say goodbye
* 'Cause no matter how hard I try *
* I can't comprehend that you're not all still here *
* I can't let you go
* 'Cause deep inside I know
* That there's nothing I can do *
* You're all just gone
* You're gone
* You're all gone
* Why did you have to feel?
* And why did I have to see?
* This should never have happened *
* Why couldn't it have been me?
*
* And it won't be okay
* I'll see you everyday but I know *
* That somehow I've gotta find a way *
* To let it go for you
* To forgive the circumstance
* To give heaven half a chance *
* To let them carry you freely off into the distance *
* Maybe this was just your time *
Hey, Jules, how are you?
I'm all right.
How's Kyle?
Still no change.
He's strong, Jules, he'll pull through.
Brie, what if they stare?
It'll be all right.
You're the queen of Oak Bay.
Yeah, on my permanent throne.
Morning, Mr. Freeman.
Hi, Brie.
Nice chair.
The hospital one was so chunky.
- Have a good day.
- See you after rehab.
- So, surfing the web last night.
- Yeah?
Apparently, some guys have a real fetish for amputees.
A bit of stumpy-rumpy-pumpy?
Gross.
So, I saw your story on TV last night.
They've been pestering me for weeks.
Hey, Tina.
Hey, Chantelle.
Jules Freeman?
- Have you got a moment?
- Oh, God.
Jules, I'll get rid of them, don't worry.
Oh, sorry, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Better than your brother.
Well, what can I say, he was always a bit messed up.
You just never really knew when he was gonna snap.
But I guess it's good he's gone.
You know, so he doesn't try and take the other leg.
You can only hope that this isn't hereditary.
Tick, tock, tick, tock.
* I'm being followed by my shadow *
* He's been creeping around
* Asking where I've been
* He keeps tapping on my shoulder *
* Telling me it's over
* So where do I begin?
* These dark days are getting harder *
* I feel I'm treading water
* So will I sink or swim?
* Roll on, push a little further *
* I keep saying is this worth it *
* Or should I just give in?
* I don't know
* I don't know which way I'm supposed to spin *
* In this circle
* And I won't waste my time on your concern *
* 'Til it's over
* I look back on a distant border *

(Singing)
Push me high sister, high!
Make me fly high, sis!
You will fall down and hurt yourself, girl!
Why do you want to fly high?
Little shrimp!
(Singing)
Ayse go see what Nedime is doing inside!
Take the laundry inside too.
- What's wrong with you dear?
- Nothing, mum.
Ayse, bring your dad's pyjamas to me.
Let's hang them out to dry, while the sun's still up.
OK mum.
My princess!
What's the matter with you dear?
What's wrong with you little darling?
Nothing's wrong dad.
I'm OK.
My angel.
Make me fly high, sis!
- Don't work too hard...
- Thank you sir.
Well done...
If my father were alive to see it, he'd really love it.
Have you seen that bastard Deniz?
He used to drop by every day, But I haven't seen him in a while.
Have you seen him Kenan?
I swear, I haven't seen him for two weeks.
Osman why is this guy hanging around here?
It's his place, he can hang around all he wants.
What's it to you?
A gang of human traffickers was busted...
We're starting our news today with a very important item.
A gang of human traffickers was busted after a magic sting.
The gang, who has smuggled dozens of women and children illegally into the country in return for large sums of money was discovered by an investigation by police intelligence.
Ayse!
Ayse!
Osman help!
Ayse is dying!
Ayse dear daughter open your eyes!
Leave them now, go get cologne from inside!
Ayse!
Ayse don't do this!
Ayse!
Mr. Demir!
Mr. Demir!
Ayse my daughter, my daughter!
O God if she survives I'll sacrifice an animal...
Deniz?
Where are you Deniz?
Deniz?
Where are you Deniz?
Where are you Deniz?
Deniz?
Where are you?
Inhale!
Exhale!
Inhale!
Hatice!
Inhale!
Exhale!
- Don't they have female doctor here?
- How would I know?
Professor, there is a foreign lady here asking for something.
- Let her wait Mahmut.
I'll see her.
- OK.
- Ayse?
- Dear darling?
- You wait here.
- My child.
Osman!
Hi.
Ayse didn't pass out because she hit the ground.
She has a cardiac aryhythmia.
We've transferred her to the intensive care unit.
We may need to operate.
Surgery?
We may need to transfer her to Antalya.
It depends on her situation.
- Hope she gets well soon.
- Thank you.
Yes please Mr. Police Officer?
Deniz Gokce, sir.
Yes we talked to his relatives.
He didn't go to his hometown.
We are waiting for your answer.
Thank you very much, sir, my regards, thank you.
Professor...
- We got a problem here.
- What is it?
The girl is pregnant.
What do you mean, pregnant?
I mean, she's pregnant.
And she's in her 13th week.
My God, she's only a child.
How did she end up pregnant?
What shall we do?
What do you mean by what shall we do?
Call Dr. Sait from gynaecology immediately.
Mr. Officer, the last we know is that he took his salary lately and said he was going on a short trip to Antalya.
Mr. Officer, Mr. Hayati is on the other line.
I'll call you back later, ok?
Ok.
Thank you.
Hello Mr. Hayati?
Is there a problem?
OK.
I'm on my way.
Chief Doctor called.
I'll be right back.
You just wait for me here.
Osman what's going on?
Do you any idea, for God's sake?
Her baby?
- Hopefully we will save both of them, right Professor?
- Hopefully.
The children are home alone.
Will Kenan be able take care of them?
He has been a restless boy recently.
She is sleeping.
Ohh, you are German?
Let me see her.
I checked from the door.
She is not even visible.
You can see her when she wakes up.
My brother Huseyin hasn't come yet I guess.
Well, Mr. Demir isn't around.
Osman, do you think there is something we don't know?
Aborting the baby would be risky.
Yes...
Is it the right thing to hide it from her family?
Are those guys from Elâzığ?
Yeah.
They are brothers.
They are working for me in Antalya in construction.
It's just like a house isn't it Osman?
Yeah...
I should talk to them and go to Germany.
How will you go?
My brother Huseyin went there.
Your brother Huseyin can go to space if he wants.
But how will you go?
I tell them I'm Kurdish.
You don't even speak Kurdish.
As if they know.
Please don't crowd around the door!
Please let me hug my daughter just once.
Not now, ma'am.
They are talking about surgery eh?
Oh Lord.
How will you pay for the surgery, Osman?
Well, Hatice does have a little savings.
But not enough I'm afraid.
I bought a plot of land once.
I guess I'll have to sell it.
I don't have much either.
You know I would never leave my brother in a fix, if only I had it.
I know brother...
Money doesn't matter as long as our daughter is safe.
We can live on bread and onions just as well.
God willing, how long is she going to be in the hospital?
They say a couple of days.
Did you call our family in Elâzığ?
Hope they don't shrug off later.
Don't trouble them.
It's a long and tiring journey.
They would suffer on the way.
Oh here you are.
I was looking for you.
There is nothing to worry about.
Guess what?
Guess?
Girl or boy?
Girl or boy?
Good news, you are pregnant.
Pregnant?
Oh God.
What is wrong with that woman?
She is pregnant.
For God's sake tell me my daughter, are these doctors hiding something from us?
Ayla, I want to abort the baby!
But why, Stefanie?
Sir, are you the father of the baby?
Yeah, she is sleeping like a baby isn't she?
I don't mean that, I mean the baby in her belly.
I will kill you all, you bastards!
What's happened, Osman?
Go find out right now!
Otherwise I kill you both, I swear.
What's going on with you Osman?
Osman!
Osman open your hands.
Open his hands!
Open your hands!
How could you?
What is it?
What's going on Osman, don't drive me nuts.
How can I say it?
How can I...
Brother I can't dare speak.
What am I going to do now?
Don't make me crazy, Osman.
She's pregnant.
Who is pregnant?
She...
What happened to her?
She has drunk insecticides.
Oh my, you see what happened.
Seyit!
Hold the child for a moment!
Bastard!
How could you do that to your uncle?
!
How dare you?
Tell me!
What honourable man would do this to his uncle?
I don't know who you took after.
Bastard!
How can I look my brother in the face now?
How will I look my uncle in the face now?
That girl doesn't exist for me Hatice.
She's finished.
Go find out who knocked her up?
I said go!
Who is the father of your bastard?
You know your father will kill you.
He will just cut your throat.
- Tell me, who?
- Please mum.
- Tell me, who it is?
- Please mum.
Look here ma'am!
Are you going to keep going in and out as you please?
Don't come in here every two seconds.
Go outside now.
What's up little Ayse?
Everything is going to be fine.
When will we be able to leave, doctor?
Let's see how she does today and then we'll decide depending on the situation.
They say the girl has killed herself.
Where did Kenan and Seyit go?
I don't know.
Who is it?
I couldn't find out.
She stares at me like a pig.
What do you mean you couldn't find out?
Don't drive me nuts here.
This is a hospital, everybody is staring at us!
I don't care.
Why didn't you find out?
I'll kill her!
What are we gonna do brother?
What do I do now?
How do I face people now?
We call the family in Elâzığ.
Whatever the elders decide, that's what we'll do.
I will kill her.
I swear on God I will kill her.
- Welcome uncle.
- Thank you my nephew.
Welcome uncle.
Don't be upset, be strong.
We will do whatever we have to.
I don't know...
Don't get all worked up.
May God preserve you!
Believe me uncle;
I don't have anything to do with this.
Don't be sad...
Where is Hatice?
In the hospital.
When will they discharge her?
They keep saying today, tomorrow.
Soon I guess.
Let me talk to Seyit first.
Your father will kill you...
I wish I'd give birth to a bar of soap rather than you.
Better had died than bring all this on us.
How are you little Ayse?
What will you name your baby?
Get well soon.
- Are you her mother?
- Yeah!
Ayse has had a serious attack.
Her pregnancy is making it even more difficult...
Ayse needs lots of liquids and plenty of rest.
And she should get her medications regularly.
OK?
When she recovers a little, an operation in a hospital with better facilities...
This is no joke, she needs the surgery.
Hope she gets well soon.
Now..
Come on and tell me.
Who is it?
Did you learn who it was?
Osman!
Come on man, Osman.
Bring an onion!
I talked to Seyit.
The boy swears he didn't do it.
What is it about that guy Mr. Demir?
What about him?
What's up with him?
- God bless you.
- Thank you uncle.
Be careful with the gearshift of the car!
It sometimes gets jammed.
..3 kids and 6 adults were rescued from the sinking boat.
And three bodies have been found so far.
Those rescued are now being treated in Bodrum Public Hospital.
The search continues for passengers of a capsized boat in the Aegean Sea.
The boat was reportedly carrying around..
..fourty people who had entered in Turkey illegally with hopes of reaching Europe through Greece.
Our next news item: "A barbaric act"
A man and his wife, seasonal workers on a farm in Mersin,..
..killed their own daughter after they learned about her illegitimate pregnancy.
The father claimed he did not regret his actions.
Do you feel any remorse?
If my other daughter did the same thing, I'd do it again.
I cleared my honour!
I have no regrets!
Now we have a guest in the studio, assistant professor...
Osman, how is the girl?
I'll take her to Antalya for the surgery.
Hope she gets well soon.
Thank you, brother.
Where is Mr. Demir?
What's wrong Osman?
I said where is he.
He went to the police station, about Deniz.
When will he be back?
I don't know.
Hatice!
Can you push my swing, sister?
Nesibe go check the fire.
You tell her we're taking her for the surgery.
Or that she is going to stay at her uncle's place...
Whatever, just make up some story.
We'll do something.
Put the shovel and pickaxe I just bought, in the trunk.
I had a thick winter coat, where is it?
Sister, push me harder...
I can't Necibe, I'm so tired.
Make me fly high!
I don't have strength, darling.
I don't...
Are you going to die sister?
Do you have a spare manure bag?
Let me bring it.
Thank God your uncle will let you stay in his house.
Nobody else would do it.
What uncle would allow his niece to deliver her bastard in his house?
Listen, you won't set foot out of the house once you get there, okay?
Pray to God, pray for, whoever fathered your bastard to come out and admit it.
Otherwise you are really going to suffer.
No.
No.
Mer-ha-ba. (Hello)
Hello.
Dad did you hear that she spoke Turkish
I.. to want..
Istanbul.. to go..
You go to Istanbul...
No I want to go to Istanbul.
I.. to want..
Istanbul.. to go..
Dad, she wants to go to Istanbul.
Thanks.
Get your hand in.
I want to get out.
Please drop me off.
This is crazy what you're doing...
Crazy.
I don't want to die...
Please drop me off!
If you need to go to the toilet, go now.
No, I don't.
Yes brother?
We can't open the trunk.
Can you take a look?
Let me have a look.
Go get some fresh air.
I don't want to.
I'm fine like this.
What did you do?
It's no good.
We have to drill it...
Leave it then.
This is a borrowed car.
Stop...
Stop...
How strange these foreigners are, don't you think dad?
What happened dad?
Nothing.
I think it's boiled over.
Come on, dad.
What are you doing girl, you'll fall!
Shall I get you something, are you hungry?
No...
I'm not hungry.
No way.
You'll take your medicine.
Go wash your face and let's eat.
God damn it!
Don't just go opening like the sultan's seal!
Thank you.
You are welcome dad.
Let's have some soup first dad.
OK...
Let's sit outside dad.
It's suffocating inside.
Oh, I forgot my medications...
You wait here I'll bring them.
You should drink clean water.
Thank you, dad.
I can't drink it now dad.
My mouth tastes rusty.
The medications taste rusty.
Even water tastes bitter to me.
I feel so anxious.
Let me take a little walk dad, is that ok?
As you wish.
We'll be here for 15 minutes.
Nobody go too far away.
Dad there is a funny smell in the car.
I don't smell anything.
Maybe it's just me.
Does it hurt?
Hurt?
It's throbbing with pain.
Take one of my pills if you like.
No, they're yours.
Dad, does mum get sick to her stomach like me?
Take it.
Thanks, dad.
How slow the guy is driving...
Your car's inspection sticker's expired.
We have to impound the car.
What do you mean?
I just got vehicle inspected.
It's expired.
You can't have it on the road that way.
It received a fine yesterday for the same reason.
Please don't do this.
Listen this is my daughter, she's going to have surgery...
I have to take her to Konya for the operation.
If you take the car what will I do?
She's getting worse on the way.
They do this surgery in Fethiye..
Ohh no..
They don't do this surgery in Fethiye..
I swear...
I swear on God.
Hope she gets well.
You better talk to the head officer.
Thank you so much.
All the best to you.
You get your vehicle inspection.
Otherwise you'll get in trouble.
Yes sir.
Dad, your hand..
Dad, your hand is bleeding...
Dad hold on, let me change with a clean cloth...
Ayse!
Were you sleeping?
No dad it's just that my eyes are hurting.
Honestly, I would have fallen asleep if you hadn't call my name.
What's wrong?
My stomach is burning.
I had a dream, Dad...
What was it?
In my dream, my little sibling was dead.
Which one?
The baby in my mum's belly.
It was a boy.
He looked like you.
Mum handed out the baby to me saying "let it be yours".
As soon as I took the baby in my arms, he started to speak.
He said "I am going to die, sister" and he just died.
I just cried and cried so much that I was parched with thirst.
They give me water but the strange thing is..
I didn't know the person giving water to me.
I knew him and didn't know him at the same time.
He was someone very close.
Yet he wouldn't show his face.
I drank the water given to me.
But the water is not water; it's not air either.
It is water and it's not.
Then I woke up.
It was a boy huh?
It was a boy dad.
So small, a tiny little thing...
He was a handsome boy.
Daddy, you used to sing me a folk song when I was little, do you remember?
Which one?
It was a song called "my Ayse"...
That one..
Would you sing it for me?
Where did you come up with this now?
Please dad.
The sheep comes slowly
Getting all muddy
Little Ayse walks to the fountain
Dragging her feet lightly.
O my Ayse, fair Ayse
The mountaintops are misty, Ayse
What's wrong, Dad?
Dad!
Dad...
Dad...
Dad...
Dad...
Dad...
Dad...
Thank you my daughter.
Don't fall asleep, I need you to keep me awake...
Ayse, my daughter, my little one, wake up...
Come on wake up Ayse.
Then I will fall asleep too.
I feel so sleepy dad.
Ayse come on my little one, wake up and wipe your side of the window.
I can't see it.
Otherwise we'll have an accident.
Dad stop!
Come out have some fresh air.
Breathe fresh air..
Breathe..
There is no fresh air dad.
I can't breathe.
Let me get you some water.
How is your finger dad?
Has it stop throbbing?
Never mind about my finger now, how are you?
Better.
Let's stop in the first gas station and
I will get lots of yoghurt and yoghurt drink for you.
And I'll take you to the hospital in the first town we arrive in and have them check you thoroughly.
We'll have a doctor see your finger too, won't we dad?
See, it's swollen.
Just throw up my daughter, it'll clean your stomach.
Eat this right now.
Clean the bowl well, my little one, don't leave anything behind.
Excuse me friend.
How far is the closest nearby town?
Where are you heading to?
To Konya.
If roads are clear it takes one and a half to two hours.
But if it is snowy then it will take two to two and a half.
The road ahead gets lots of snow this time of year.
A boat sank in the Aegean Sea!
The coast guard reported that the 25 year-old Deniz Gokce, has been missing for the past week.
5 bodies have recovered so far and the police are not hopeful for the remaining passengers.
A major effort has been launched against criminal organizations providing supplies to illegal refugees.
Deniz!
You have created the whole world, the plants, the insects, the sheep the mountains and the plains, the heavens,
You have created each and every thing.
How hard is this for you?
Oh God spare my child.
Spare my little one.
You know I haven't been fasting lately.
You know I have some health problems.
Yet I will start fasting no matter what.
I will even fast the days I didn't for redemption.
You know I've missed Friday prayers while earning the bread for my kids.
From this day onwards I won't miss Friday prayers.
I won't hit my wife even..
..when she drives me nuts.
To nobody, I swear to nobody...
Oh Lord everything is open to you, it's not that I am bargaining...
My Lord...
Please give her back to me.
Spare my little one.
Deniz...
Deniz what shall I do now?
The cruel father: "I do not regret"
What's the difference between them?
Well, I don't know the difference.
They just tell us to sell this one for 35 and that one for 60.
So that's what we do.
Otherwise one is no better than the other.
We will fix a tire not a donkey.
My little one.
My Ayse.
Put this on too!
It looks lovely on you, lovely on my Ayse.
Thank you, daddy.
Thank you.
We have short way to go until the town.
I have asked people.
We'll get to the hospital right away.
Have this yoghurt-drink again my dear.
See it'll do you good.
I don't know what they did in the hospital to me but I just can't return to normal, dad.
The medications taste terrible too, I'd rather die.
It's a good thing, we took this trip, dad.
Don't cry dad!
No, I'm not crying...
What made you think that?
It'll grow up with my sibling.
Who will grow?
With my brother...
Stop dad!
Allah, Allah!
Ayse...
Come up here my daughter, push the accelerator.
The gear is jammed.
Come on my girl...
If it's a boy, we'll name him after you, right dad?
Who knows where the Germans are now.
Who knows what they are doing.
I wonder if they have children.
Oh brother...
Oh...
Don't go to sleep!
Ayse!
Wake up my daughter.
Help me with this.
The gear's jammed again.
Ayse!
Hang on my daughter.
Hang on Ayse.
I could put up with embarrassment and mockery but what could you do?
Everybody would...
Your bastard child...
My Ayse hang on, we are almost there.
We'll give them both the same name.
They'll grow up as siblings together.
Yes, why not?
They'll grow up as siblings together...
They'll grow up as siblings...
Make me fly daddy!
Make me fly daddy!
Make me fly daddy!
My Ayse!
It's OK Ayse!
Don't worry my little one!
It's OK my Ayse!
O my Ayse, my fair Ayse...
The mountaintops are misty, my Ayse.
Femme Fatales 02x12 Libra Original Air Date on August 10, 2012
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
Give me 20 minutes, Detective.
Why am I still here?
What am I, forensic evidence?
Well, he's definitely seen better days.
So you want to tell me what happened?
I ain't telling you shit.
Maybe you don't understand quite how this all works.
You see, you tell me everything I want to know... or I feed you to Olesky's crew... what's left of it... piece by piece.
And I got to tell ya,
I ain't never seen nothing like this before.
Eddie Mars' head looks like a crushed watermelon.
Iggy Bacardi... nobody's gonna miss this prick.
Judging by the burn marks, looks like he was electrocuted.
And our man over here, he's got a crushed trachea and third-degree burns-- so what do you say?
Why don't we try this again, and this time, you tell me everything?
Two nights ago, I was kicking back, enjoying the view at Club Rouge...
Olesky's brothel on Harlowe and Lake.
Olesky wanted to see me about something, but I had to wait until he finished.
Finished with what?
His all-you-can-eat buffet.
Yes!
Mmm, yeah!
Dimitri didn't like to drink, he didn't like to do drugs, but he sure as hell liked to fuck.
Yeah.
And he liked to sample the merchandise, especially when he had something to celebrate.
♪ ♪
Hello?
No.
I'm in a meeting right now.
Yeah.
Yeah, call me later.
Okay.
And Olesky had been celebrating ever since Mr. Ryan got knocked off six months ago.
Don't you know who the hell I am?
Don't you know who I am?
I hear you like to hurt girls.
Since Ryan went down, all the bosses have been jockeying for power in Cuesta Verde.
It's been a bloody war-- awfully bad for business.
Iggy Bacardi brokered a peace and wanted Olesky to sit at the head of the table.
It didn't go down well with the other bosses, especially Eddie Mars.
I know all that, Bailey.
What I don't know is why these three assholes are lying here swimming in their own blood, and you're the only jerk who's still got a pulse.
I was getting to that, Detective.
♪ ♪
So I was chilling with my good friend Vera,
Olesky's favorite girl when he isn't using her as a punching bag, when Chaka comes in and tells me Olesky's ready to see me.
Chaka?
You know him as laddie Sterling.
Yeah, we call him "Chaka" because he's short and hairy, and he looks like that Neanderthal thing that Clint Howard played in that old kids' TV show
The Land of the Lost-- you know, the one with the clay dinosaurs and shit?
You idiot... that wasn't Clint Howard.
It just looked like him.
What kind of cop are you, anyhow?
Just keep talking.
Gotta love the Viagra.
Maxi.
How long we known each other, huh?
It's been a long time, huh?
Yeah.
Your papa and me ran numbers together back then, huh?
Right?
Yeah, that's the way I remember it, sir.
I feel like I could tell you anything, like you're-- you're my son.
Now, I hope you feel the same way about me.
Well, no one can ever replace your pop,
God rest his soul, but the fact is I looked out for you ever since you got out of the slam.
Yeah, I know that.
And I appreciate it, Mr. Olesky.
Really, I do.
Maybe, uh... maybe I don't say it enough, but Lord knows I...
I don't know where I'd be without you.
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that... because we got ourselves a problem...
A big problem.
Yeah, what's that?
We got a mole in the house... a cocksucking police stooge.
You sure about that?
Yes.
I'm sure.
My guy in C.V.P.D. confirmed it.
Mm-hmm.
You know who it is?
Yes, I do.
Who is it?
You.

It could be argued that there is a fine line between fantasy and reality.
Dimitri "UZI" Olesky just won his war against the Ryan mob.
Oh, and he paid a very heavy price to do it.
But all's fair in love and war, and for now, he is the undisputed crime boss of Cuesta Verde.
Ironically, boss Olesky will pay for his sins, but retribution will come from a place he least expects it, for in the end, the scales of justice always tip one way or another.
Mrs. Felstein wasn't at her desk.
Sorry to just, uh, walk in on you like this.
That's because I sent her home early.
Close the door, please.
I wouldn't want to incriminate myself in front of the assistant district attorney, but Dimitri had me robbing one of his warehouses down at the dock so I could file an insurance cl--
don't you have some work to do?
It can wait.
What's wrong?
You didn't say hello.
I want you.
♪ ♪
So hot.
I was--I was surprised you got that Socetti case dismissed.
Even Dimitri thought he was going downhill for that one... especially after Homeland Security got involved.
Well, I had some help on that, and Dimitri spread a lot of cash to make it go away.
Help, huh?
So Olesky does have a mole in Special Investigations.
Any idea who it is?
Not a clue.
Since when are you so nosy?
Anyway, it's a good thing he does.
I can't keep blowing big cases every week without someone catching on.
You ever think... what if you hadn't started taking bribes?
With Burke and Banyon dead, you really could have amounted to something in this town.
Fuck you, darling.
I'll be something in this town because I can be bought.
They got off cheap with Burke, but with me, they're gonna have to pay retail.
That's probably him.
I'm not gonna get it.
Hello?
It's for you.
Hey, Maxi, enough fun-- get your fucking ass back over here right now, you hear me?
Yes, sir.
I'm on my way.
So he knows about us, huh?
He knows about everything, Max.
He's like God with a gun.
You sure you have to leave?
I was just getting warmed up.
Boss says, "jump," I say, "how high?"
Swing by the house tonight, and we can finish what we started.
Sure...
If I don't get hung up.
Get up!
Get the fuck up!
Come on, move!
Move!
Ooh!
You're a dead man, Max!
You just don't know it yet!
So you're telling me you're an undercover cop?
No, not a cop-- just a highly motivated civilian.
I reached out to Sergeant Terello about ten months ago.
He'll confirm that I've been working with the C.V.P.D. ever since.
I ain't confirming nothing with nobody until you start answering my questions-- all my questions.
Fine.
So I was running out of there as quick as my legs could carry me.
It wasn't easy with a bullet in my thigh.
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
I'm out.
I'm out too.
Looks like this is the end of the road for you, Maxi.

Who the fuck are you?
Were you expecting someone else?

Aah!
Ha!
Haya!

You okay?
Hey, stay with me.
Stay with me.
Hey.
Focus.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Hey, don't move.
I need to dress your wound.
Aah!
Oh, my God.
Man up, pretty boy.
You know, you're lucky to be alive.
Luck had nothing to do with it.
You did... unless I'm dead, and this is all some sort of dream.
See?
No dream.
You're telling me some chick named Libra dressed in black spandex, wearing a Halloween mask, saved your ass, took you back to her secret hideout, like some kind of comic-book superhero?
It wasn't spandex.
It was leather.
And she is a comic-book superhero.
At least she thinks she is.
Well, please, don't let me interrupt.
Continue.
Where am I, lady?
The name's not "lady."
It's Libra.
Okay, nice to meet you, um...
Libra.
My name is m--
- Max Bailey-- I know.
I've had Olesky's place under surveillance for weeks.
- Are you a cop?
- You never know.
But mostly just a concerned citizen... same as you.
That's the first time anyone's ever called me that.
Your father worked for Olesky.
They were partners until Olesky cut him out of the business.
When your father started to talk,
Olesky had him killed.
You want revenge... just like I do.
But instead of wearing a mask... you're helping the police.
You're looking for Olesky's mole in Special Investigations.
Yeah, do you know who that is?
Not yet.
Look, I need to report in.
Tomorrow night Olesky's having a sit-down with the other bosses.
That's right.
I plan on being there.
Who are you?
I mean, nobody names their kid "Libra."
We're on the same team, Max.
We just wear different uniforms.
Do I frighten you?
Isn't that the idea?
There's a reason you should be frightened of me.
Before, I was just a woman.
But gangsters aren't scared by women.
They use them, exploit them, manipulate them.
But Libra... she's a symbol... someone... that they can't bribe... scare... or fuck.
And the scales of justice always tip in Libra's favor.
But right now...
I'm not Libra.
I'm just a woman.
You're beautiful.
Thank you, Max Bailey.
So what do you know about Libras?
Hmm?
- Ask me later.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm still learning.
- Yeah?
Well, for one... we loathe cruelty, viciousness, and vulgarity, but we believe in compassion and compromise.
Doesn't sound like you.
You know... what else?
We like to be touched.
Oh.
That leg isn't gonna give you trouble, now, is it?
- No, I'll manage.
- That's what I thought.
You are so... beautiful.

And I want anyone who even talks to them dead!
It took a lot of blood.
It took a lot of treasure to get Bacardi to back me in this war, and you let them get away, slip through your fucking fingers.
Do I make myself clear?
Good.
Hey!
Everyone out... now.
Eddie Mars wanted me dead... for putting you at the head of the table.
And now I find out you had a police mole running around as part of your crew?
It was Frank Bailey's son.
I had no reason not to trust him.
You cut his father out of your business, then had him killed.
What did you expect-- the guy's undying fucking gratitude?
The Ryans... they understood the importance of peace.
I'm beginning to wonder if you do.
I promise you... we will find Max, and we will kill him.
He shacks up with the assistant D.A.
She's on my payroll.
If you can't silence this pest... the rest of the families... will silence you.
Capisce.
Yeah.
Thanks for the drink.
We'll see you tomorrow night.
My name is Libra, and these streets are mine.
Where the hell am I?
Cuesta Verde hospital.
How the hell did I get here?
Someone dropped you off on the curb outside the emergency room.
You had a nasty gunshot wound in your leg.
Where the hell are my clothes?
Over there.
You can't leave.
You--
No, I can't stay.
There's somewhere I have to be.
Here... you can have that.
"Libra"?
She's a comic-book character who gets revenge on people who screwed her over.
Something tells me you might enjoy it.
You have no idea.
Good luck.
You thought I wouldn't know where you were going?
You shouldn't be here.
Neither should you.
Being anywhere near Olesky right now is a very bad idea.
Yeah, and you need to let me be.
Let me take him down.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
You try and get in there, and you're dead.
Libra is a fictional comic-book character.
Somehow I don't think the author based his stories on your real-life exploits.
You're not Libra.
He let my mother die.
Some kidnappers took her for some easy score.
They tried to ransom her back.
$5 million-- they wanted $5 million...
Pocket change for my father.
He told 'em to go fuck themselves, refused to pay a dime.
Cops found her a couple days later, raped and mutilated.
We had to have a closed casket.
He didn't even come to the funeral-- too busy fucking one of his whores.
- Oh, God!
- Oh!
You're Anya Olesky?
No.
I'm Libra, and these streets are mine.
And tonight Dimitri Olesky will pay for the blood that he has spilled.
Okay, I quit.
I can't beat you.
But I can take everyone else.
Not that...
anyone's coming after me.
I mean, families are off-limits.
What?
Eddie Mars, Leland Ryan-- he's got a daughter too.
You are not safe.
No one's safe.
I know you don't want to be here, Kitaro.
But this won't last forever, I promise.
I know you want to go back to your family.
I'm gonna talk to my father.
He's a reasonable man.
He'll let you go home one day.
No.
He'll never let me go.
Your father... is a monster.
You think he tried to save your mother?
He did.
He did everything that he could.
He did nothing.
Ah!
He let those men kill her.
He wanted her dead.
Kick it!
I'm sorry I have to tell you that.
I'm sorry, Anya.
Evidence of his complicity in murders, robberies, and extortion-- enough to put him away for ten lifetimes.
I don't understand why you would want to put your own father behind bars.
Because he let her die.
And now I am gonna let him rot in prison forever.
I'm glad you came to me first with this.
I'd like you to speak to one of my associates.
Thank you, Miss Swanson.
If you'll please step outside...
- This is my office.
- Now.
I am so sorry, Anya.
You could have done something!
You could have saved her!
And then you lied to me!
You told me that you paid them, and you didn't pay them a goddamn dime!
What do you mean you're not fucking paying me?
Why, Daddy?
Because, my darling daughter,
I was so very bored of the bitch.
Oh, fuck you!
What are you doing?
Why are you protecting him after everything he has done to you and your family?
Live to fight another day.
It's time, my darling daughter, you had a nice, long rest.
Hey, Andy.
What you readin'?
Oh, hey.
Just a comic book.
Pretty geeky stuff, huh?
No, I like comic books.
My father threw all mine away.
An oldie but a goodie.
"Libra."
It's an obscure comic from the '80s.
Only ran a few issues, 'cause it was so violent.
I think Tipper Gore got pretty pissed off about it back in the day.
Won it on a snipe bid in the last three seconds on eBay.
- It's pretty cool.
- Yeah.
Bet it's worth something.
Overstreet Price Guide has it valued at over 100 bucks in mint condition.
- Looks good.
- Totally.
It's a story about a girl who seeks revenge from her family being murdered.
She comes back as this vigilante--Libra.
She even has a catchphrase.
"These streets are mine."
You want it?
- I don't have $100.
- On the house.
Really?
Thanks, Andy.
Hey, how come you're always so nice to me?
Because you're not supposed to be here.
You better take this.
Okay.
Whoa!
What do we have here?
Oh, comic books.
Very harmful to the psyche, Miss Olesky.
They seduce the innocent.
Our upcoming therapy session should...
Oh... rid you of any malicious tendencies.
I don't need shock therapy.
My father wants me dead.
And you're on his payroll, just like this whole fucking town.
That is crazy, my dear.
Your father does not want you dead.
He loves you.
He just wants you to forget.
He asked you to lobotomize me.
We don't... like to use that word.
But... clinically, I, uh...
Mmm, mmm... guess it's accurate.
Fuck you!
Language, my dear.
Language.
Here... promise me you'll have a good read.
You're fucking crazy.
"The play's the thing wherein I'll catch conscience of the King."
Shakespeare, Hamlet, act two.
We are going to take this to Broadway.
Shakespeare Undressed.
Mmm, and then...
"I'd like to thank the Academy.
"It is such an honor to accept this award

"I am especially indebted to sir Patrick Stewart

We need to get dressed, like, pronto-rooni.
For what?
The awards are today.
We're both nominated.
I shouldn't be here.
My father just sent me here to shut me up.
And?
A little electric shock never hurt anybody... except this one girl I knew.
She fried in a bathtub.
Ew.
They're gonna lobotomize me.
Bummer for you!
Lights out, Anya.
Hey, I'm reading Libra.
Yeah?
What do you think?
It's great.
All these other comic-book superheroes that get dosed by gamma rays or bitten by radioactive spiders are silly, but Libra... she doesn't even have any special powers.
She has complete self-reliance.
And a bitchin' costume.
You know, that's the great thing about comic books.
Anything's possible.
Sometimes anything is possible.
Libra rules.
Comics aren't just for kids anymore, Andy.
I could get fired for this.
No.
No one will know.
And even if I did say something, no one would believe me in here, 'cause everyone thinks I'm crazy... everyone but you.

My name... is Libra.
- Anya, no!
- Ha!
Oh!
By the time I got in the room, the massacre was over.
I found Libra standing over Olesky's dead body.
She tied me up, and she left me here so I wouldn't follow her.
That's quite a story.
What do you say we do, uh...
Green Eggs and Ham for an encore?
I'm kind of fond of Dr. Seuss.
Every word of it is true, Detective.
You know what I think is true?
I think there ain't no mole and you made this whole story up to cover your own ass.
Either that, or you are crooked.
If you think that, you're dumber than you look, 'cause I not only have all of Olesky's records-- money laundering operations, extortion, gambling, prostitution, the works-- but I also have a list of everybody on Olesky's payroll,
including his mole in C.V.P.D.
So where is this magic list?
On a jump drive in my back pocket.
Well, that certainly makes things convenient.
Wouldn't want that list to get in the wrong hands.
What are you talking about?
Where's the real data?
You talk to me, and maybe I won't kill you.
Yeah, I find that hard to believe, Detective.
You're awfully cocky for somebody who's about to become a corpse.
So tell me, how did you figure out it was me?
I didn't... until now.
Dimitri has someone on the inside in the C.V.P.D.
- You think they know about me?
- I don't think so.
Good.
That prick is trying to consolidate power in Cuesta Verde.
And it's up to me to stop him.
I'm gonna make him pay for what he did to my father... and for what he did to you.
See, I knew there was a mole in Special Investigations.
I just didn't know who it was until you just told me.
You think you're so clever.
Well, tell me, why is it you're the one who's tied up, and I'm the one who's holding the gun?
Well, that may be true, but there is one thing that you did not count on.
I told you.
Libra, I presume.
These streets are mine!
Well, you got your revenge.
I guess we both did.
Now what?
It's not about us anymore.
There's a lot of people suffering in Cuesta Verde... people who have no one to help them.
Cuesta Verde needs a symbol.
A champion for the oppressed.
You know anyone for the job?
I might.
That was a rhetorical question.
I can't do this all by myself.
I need a Robin.
"A Robin"?
Your very own boy wonder?
I don't think so.
Ah, come on.
You'd look hot in tights.
We'll see, Anya.
The name's Libra, and these streets are mine.
We all wear masks-- sometimes for fun and other times for disguise or protection.
Some masks are steel.
Some are satin.
Some are silk, and some are leather.
They're the faces of a stranger, but we love to try them on.
Hopefully, you'll find one that is a perfect fit.

Dimitri "UZI" Olesky just won his war against the Ryan mob.
Oh, and he paid a very heavy price to do it.
But all's fair in love and war, and for now, he is the undisputed crime boss of Cuesta Verde.
Ironically, boss Olesky will pay for his sins, but retribution will come from a place he least expects it, for in the end, the scales of justice always tip one way or another.

That's right.
I plan on being there.
Who are you?
I mean, nobody names their kid "Libra."
[Zipper opens]
We're on the same team, Max.
We just wear different uniforms.
Do I frighten you?
Isn't that the idea?
There's a reason you should be frightened of me.
[Grunts]
Before, I was just a woman.
But gangsters aren't scared by women.
They use them, exploit them, manipulate them.
But Libra... she's a symbol... someone... that they can't bribe... scare... or fuck.
And the scales of justice always tip in Libra's favor.
But right now...
I'm not Libra.
I'm just a woman.
You're beautiful.
Thank you, Max Bailey.
So what do you know about Libras?
- [Breathes heavily]
- Hmm?
- Ask me later.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm still learning.
- Yeah?
Well, for one... we loathe cruelty, viciousness, and vulgarity, but we believe in compassion and compromise.
Doesn't sound like you.
[Laughs] You know... what else?
We like to be touched.
- [Grunts]
- Oh.
That leg isn't gonna give you trouble, now, is it?
- No, I'll manage.
- That's what I thought.
You are so... beautiful.

I want Max Bailey dead.
I want the girl...
dead.
And I want anyone who even talks to them dead!
It took a lot of blood.
It took a lot of treasure to get Bacardi to back me in this war, and you let them get away, slip through your fucking fingers.
Do I make myself clear?
Good.
Hey!
[Sings in Russian]
[Laughs, speaking Russian]
[Speaking Russian]
Everyone out... now.
Eddie Mars wanted me dead... for putting you at the head of the table.
And now I find out you had a police mole running around as part of your crew?
It was Frank Bailey's son.
I had no reason not to trust him.
You cut his father out of your business, then had him killed.
What did you expect-- the guy's undying fucking gratitude?
The Ryans... they understood the importance of peace.
I'm beginning to wonder if you do.
I promise you... we will find Max, and we will kill him.
He shacks up with the assistant D.A.
She's on my payroll.
If you can't silence this pest... the rest of the families... will silence you.
Capisce.
Yeah.
Thanks for the drink.
We'll see you tomorrow night.

[Gun cocks]
My name is Libra, and these streets are mine.
[Gasps] [Monitor beeping]
[Sighs, grunts]
Where the hell am I?
Cuesta Verde hospital.
How the hell did I get here?
[Beeping continues]
[Beeping accelerates]
[Beeping slows]
Someone dropped you off on the curb outside the emergency room.
You had a nasty gunshot wound in your leg.
Where the hell are my clothes?
Over there.
You can't leave.
You- [grunts] No, I can't stay.
There's somewhere I have to be.
Here... you can have that.
"Libra"?
She's a comic-book character who gets revenge on people who screwed her over.
Something tells me you might enjoy it.
You have no idea.
Good luck.
You thought I wouldn't know where you were going?
You shouldn't be here.
Neither should you.
Being anywhere near Olesky right now is a very bad idea.
Yeah, and you need to let me be.
Let me take him down.
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
You try and get in there, and you're dead.
Libra is a fictional comic-book character.
Somehow I don't think the author based his stories on your real-life exploits.
You're not Libra.
He let my mother die.
Some kidnappers took her for some easy score.
[Muffled yelling]
They tried to ransom her back.
$5 million-- they wanted $5 million...
Pocket change for my father.
He told 'em to go fuck themselves, refused to pay a dime.
[Muffled yelling]
Cops found her a couple days later, raped and mutilated.
We had to have a closed casket.
He didn't even come to the funeral-- too busy fucking one of his whores.
- Oh, God!
- Oh!
You're Anya Olesky?
No.
I'm Libra, and these streets are mine.
And tonight Dimitri Olesky will pay for the blood that he has spilled.
[Sighs] Okay, I quit.
I can't beat you.
But I can take everyone else.
Not that...
anyone's coming after me.
I mean, families are off-limits.
What?
Eddie Mars, Leland Ryan-- he's got a daughter too.
[Scoffs]
You are not safe.
No one's safe.
I know you don't want to be here, Kitaro.
But this won't last forever, I promise.
I know you want to go back to your family.
I'm gonna talk to my father.
He's a reasonable man.
He'll let you go home one day.
No.
He'll never let me go.
Your father... is a monster.
You think he tried to save your mother?
He did.
He did everything that he could.
He did nothing.
Ah!
He let those men kill her.
He wanted her dead.
Kick it!
I'm sorry I have to tell you that.
[Gunshot] I'm sorry, Anya.
Evidence of his complicity in murders, robberies, and extortion-- enough to put him away for ten lifetimes.
I don't understand why you would want to put your own father behind bars.
Because he let her die.
And now I am gonna let him rot in prison forever.
I'm glad you came to me first with this.
I'd like you to speak to one of my associates.
[Door opens]
Thank you, Miss Swanson.
If you'll please step outside...
- This is my office.
- Now.
I am so sorry, Anya.
[Door closes]
You could have done something!
You could have saved her!
And then you lied to me!
You told me that you paid them, and you didn't pay them a goddamn dime!
What do you mean you're not fucking paying me?
Why, Daddy?
Because, my darling daughter,
I was so very bored of the bitch.
Oh, fuck you!
What are you doing?
Why are you protecting him after everything he has done to you and your family?
Live to fight another day.
It's time, my darling daughter, you had a nice, long rest.
[Indistinct arguing]
Hey, Andy.
What you readin'?
Oh, hey.
Just a comic book.
Pretty geeky stuff, huh?
No, I like comic books.
My father threw all mine away.
An oldie but a goodie.
"Libra."
It's an obscure comic from the '80s.
Only ran a few issues, 'cause it was so violent.
I think Tipper Gore got pretty pissed off about it back in the day.
Won it on a snipe bid in the last three seconds on eBay.
- It's pretty cool.
- Yeah.
Bet it's worth something.
Overstreet Price Guide has it valued at over 100 bucks in mint condition.
- Looks good.
- Totally.
It's a story about a girl who seeks revenge from her family being murdered.
She comes back as this vigilante--Libra.
She even has a catchphrase.
- "These streets are mine." - [Chuckles]
You want it?
- I don't have $100.
- On the house.
Really?
Thanks, Andy.
Hey, how come you're always so nice to me?
Because you're not supposed to be here.
[Scoffs]
You better take this.
Okay.
[Sighs]
[Thunder booming]
Whoa!
What do we have here?
Oh, comic books.
Very harmful to the psyche, Miss Olesky.
They seduce the innocent.
Our upcoming therapy session should...
Oh... rid you of any malicious tendencies.
I don't need shock therapy.
My father wants me dead.
And you're on his payroll, just like this whole fucking town.
That is crazy, my dear.
Your father does not want you dead.
He loves you.
He just wants you to forget.
He asked you to lobotomize me.
We don't...
[Distant struggling] like to use that word.
But... clinically, I, uh...
Mmm, mmm... guess it's accurate.
Fuck you!
[Sighs]
Language, my dear.
Language.
Here... promise me you'll have a good read.
You're fucking crazy.
[Distant struggling]
[Whistling]
"The play's the thing wherein I'll catch conscience of the King."

We need to get dressed, like, pronto-rooni.
For what?
The awards are today.
We're both nominated.
I shouldn't be here.
My father just sent me here to shut me up.
And?
A little electric shock never hurt anybody... except this one girl I knew.
She fried in a bathtub.
[Electricity crackling]
Ew.
[Giggles]
They're gonna lobotomize me.
[Gasps] Bummer for you!
[Laughs]
[Hums]
Lights out, Anya.
Hey, I'm reading Libra.
Yeah?
What do you think?
It's great.
All these other comic-book superheroes that get dosed by gamma rays or bitten by radioactive spiders are silly, but Libra... she doesn't even have any special powers.
She has complete self-reliance.
And a bitchin' costume.
[Snickers] You know, that's the great thing about comic books.
Anything's possible.
Sometimes anything is possible.
Libra rules.
Comics aren't just for kids anymore, Andy.
I could get fired for this.
No.
No one will know.
And even if I did say something, no one would believe me in here, 'cause everyone thinks I'm crazy... everyone but you.

She killed them all... one by one.
- Aah!
- No mercy.
Eddie Mars, Bacardi...
[Electricity crackles] [Screams]
But she saved the best...
[Crackling]
- For last.
- Anya.
My name... is Libra.
- Anya, no!
- Ha!
[Electricity crackling] Oh!
By the time I got in the room, the massacre was over.
I found Libra standing over Olesky's dead body.
She tied me up, and she left me here so I wouldn't follow her.
That's quite a story.
What do you say we do, uh...
Green Eggs and Ham for an encore?
I'm kind of fond of Dr. Seuss.
Every word of it is true, Detective.
You know what I think is true?
I think there ain't no mole and you made this whole story up to cover your own ass.
Either that, or you are crooked.
If you think that, you're dumber than you look, 'cause I not only have all of Olesky's records-- money laundering operations, extortion, gambling, prostitution, the works-- but I also have a list of everybody on Olesky's payroll,
including his mole in C.V.P.D.
So where is this magic list?
On a jump drive in my back pocket.
Well, that certainly makes things convenient.
Wouldn't want that list to get in the wrong hands.
What are you talking about?
[Giggling]
[Chuckles]
Where's the real data?
[Gun cocks]
You talk to me, and maybe I won't kill you.
Yeah, I find that hard to believe, Detective.
You're awfully cocky for somebody who's about to become a corpse.
So tell me, how did you figure out it was me?
I didn't... until now.
Dimitri has someone on the inside in the C.V.P.D.
- You think they know about me?
- I don't think so.
Good.
That prick is trying to consolidate power in Cuesta Verde.
And it's up to me to stop him.
I'm gonna make him pay for what he did to my father... and for what he did to you.
See, I knew there was a mole in Special Investigations.
I just didn't know who it was until you just told me.
You think you're so clever.
Well, tell me, why is it you're the one who's tied up, and I'm the one who's holding the gun?
Well, that may be true, but there is one thing that you did not count on.
[Door opens]
[Clanging]
[Electricity crackles]
I told you.
Libra, I presume.
These streets are mine!
[Electricity crackles]
Well, you got your revenge.
I guess we both did.
Now what?
It's not about us anymore.
There's a lot of people suffering in Cuesta Verde... people who have no one to help them.
Cuesta Verde needs a symbol.
A champion for the oppressed.
You know anyone for the job?
I might.
That was a rhetorical question.
I can't do this all by myself.
I need a Robin.
"A Robin"?
Your very own boy wonder?
I don't think so.
Ah, come on.
You'd look hot in tights.
We'll see, Anya.
The name's Libra, and these streets are mine.
We all wear masks-- sometimes for fun and other times for disguise or protection.
Some masks are steel.
Some are satin.
Some are silk, and some are leather.
They're the faces of a stranger, but we love to try them on.
Hopefully, you'll find one that is a perfect fit.

Well, don't let that affect your work.
No, I'm really trying not to.
It's just that, you know, I have to run the wires from the other building...
Building and, you know, there's asbestos in the ducts, which...
Good for breathing, so I'm tired.
DENNIS:
Why are you watching this crap?
Come on, turn the TV off.
Let's go out, let's do something...
I'm bored.
Hey, let's go dancing, huh?
I want to do something.
Dancing?
We're watching Real Housewives.
You know, there's nothing real about this shit, Frank.
You know that, come on.
Real women don't even look like that.
SWEET DEE:
Hey, guys.
That is what real women look like.
Dee, are you sick?
No, I feel great.
Oh, I haven't had a chance to shower for a few days.
I've been gaming like a loon.
You've been what?
Gaming...
I've been playing this online video game.
It is awesome.
Charlie, speaking of which, you want to come play my avatar for a little bit while I run some errands?
I don't want my crops to die.
Nah, I'm kind of busy working for the guys at the ele... (groans) Shit!
Yes, he's working for us.
He will do nothing of the sort.
We're going dancing.
Come on!
What if I give you three bucks?
Hey, you're our employee.
You do what we say.
I pay your rent.
Do not drop those wires!
Hey, Charlie, to live is to dance.
Let's go.
Charlie, what if I gave you five bucks?
You owe me five bucks!
(electrical snap)
(Charlie yells)
Ah, shit!
Screw it!
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go with Dee, okay?
But I'm getting sick of this shit, I really am.
You treat me like a dumb-dumb and a grunt, and I have potential, you know?
(panting)
I can go places, I can do things.
Who knows?
I might even rule the world one day.
Rule the world, huh?
Yeah, if that happens, I'll blow myself.

Okay, so it's called TechPocalypse, right?
And we're post-apocalypse, and we have to rebuild civilization.
This is me, ZingingCutie23.

It's a number to put at the end of that.

Just watch over my tribe, and make sure nobody, you know, takes it over, and I'll give you your money, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Wait.
Hold on a second.
What is that?
That's you.
You're one of my subjects.
That's me.
Why am I in the game?
Is that Mac?
Of course that's Mac.
You guys are all here.
See, Mac's my handmaiden.
How do you do?
How do you do?
And Dennis is a midget blacksmith.

Frank is a mutant half-donkey.

And you're my jester.
Why am I eating out of a trough?
Made sense.
Are you kidding me?
So let me get this straight.
You've been playing this game for, like, a week straight just so you feel like you lord over all of us?
Is that what this is?
Charlie, do you want your five bucks or not?
I want my five dollars.
It's just pathetic, Dee.
Okay, well, maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.
I really do need the money, though.
Yeah, well, then get to work.
Can you give me an advance?
No, not in advance.
We'll see how well you do.
All right, I got this.
I got this.
(dance music plays)
Yeah.
See, this is what I'm talking about, guys, huh?
I mean, playing online video games and watching stupid reality shows... that's not real life.
It's keeping people from experiencing real life.
Yeah?
This is real.
It's real, but it feels weird as shit.
There's nobody else in the bar dancing.
We're setting the tone, Frank.
Yeah, we will lead, and others will follow.
I'm stopping.
Oh, come on, don't stop.
Look, all right, let's go do some shots, and that will get you guys fired up, and we'll come back out, and we'll do some more of this or whatever.
You know, you can do the move, and...
well, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey, uh, bartender, three shots of whiskey, come on.
Hey, I know you guys.
You're the donkey man and the princess, right?
We don't know what you're talking about.
Take a hike, Bozo.

Check it out.
Look at this.
This is... this is you, right?
This-this is Frank and-and Mac from ZingingCutie's tribe?
What the hell is this?
This is Dee's online video game, and she's created characters for all of us.
She's humiliating us virtually.
Who cares?
It's a video game.
What do you mean, who cares?
This is starting to piss me off.
Stop getting invested in fake realities.
Let's live real life!
Well, Dennis, my anger feels very real.
Are you feeling it?
Are you feeling it?
Yeah, well, it's not real.
It's not.
I-I-I...
I'm angry.
Okay, it's not real, and you know what it also isn't?
It also isn't epic, okay?
And you know what is epic?
Doing these shots, going out there and dancing.
Come on, do it, do the shots.
I'll do the shots.
I'll just do the shots.
How about that?
Mm-hmm.
(groaning)
(grunting)
(high-pitched humming)
Oh, somebody got a smart phone.
Okay, you know, I tell you what, Carl.
Let's settle for a C trade.
We'll call it a day on that.
I got to run.
ZingingCutie44 is back, so I'm out.
(laughing):
Changed your name.
What the hell are you doing, Charlie?
I told you to just feed my crops.
I did, I fed your crops, and then I gathered some rocks, and
I built a little wall around your tribe.
Then I used the leftover rocks to dam the river so that you could fish.
Now you're doing well in the game.
You sucked at it, all right?
All you did was spend your money on stuff you don't need, just like in real life.
I don't do that in real life.
Yes, you do.
What did you get at the store?
I bought a smart phone so that I can play the game on the go.
What's going on with the fingernails?
Well, I had those done like Flo-Jo.
Why?
!
It's craziness.
I just thought it would be funny.
I...
Dee, this is your problem.
I could take this money, I could feed myself for a month.
I would buy milk, I would buy flour, I'd buy vitamins, I'd boil them down to little energy balls to sustain me, but whatever.
Forget it.
Enjoy your game, enjoy all your new followers, and you're welcome.
Oh, shit!
Charlie, you got me 31 new followers?
Yeah.
That's amazing!
Hey, do you want to maybe team up?
No, 'cause I don't want to be a slave.
Come on, Charlie, please.
I need you.
It's, like, when I'm doing good in the game, I'm doing good in life.
Oh, I want to make fun of you for saying that, but I kind of know what you mean.
It's like I'm thriving.
You are thriving.
Yeah, I did feel that, and I...
You felt that?
I did, I felt that, you know, and I never get to thrive.
I want to be the guy who thrives for once.
Right?
Me, neither.
All right, I'll tell you what... make me your king, and let's get rocking.
Ew, no.
I don't want to do that 'cause we'd have to be married, and that would be awful.
Oh, okay, I'll see you later.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
I'll make you my king; just accept my request to consummate.
Consummate?
What is that?
Have sex.
Oh.
So, um, we should have sex then?
In the game.
Yeah, in the game, sure, yeah.
Yeah.
Either way.
Uh, so, push enter hard, or one, like, slow push, and you do your thing, or a little circular action?
Just push the button, Charlie.
Just push the button.
(Charlie grunts)
(sighs)
That was good, right?
Was it?
I think.
You see me, Frank, you see me coming?
I see you, I see you.
Oh, here comes another guy.
I'm gonna fight him.
Mac attack!
Fight!
I lost again!
Goddamn it, how do I keep losing?
I'm huge.
Stop fighting every guy in the game.
The fighting is the best part.
It's the only reason I'm playing.
Oh, my God, will you guys please shut up?
I'm hungover as shit.
We're playing TechPocalypse.
(Dennis groans)
Mac is a soiled fool, and I am a gorgeous girl with big cans and.
I'm banging all the fishermen in sight for fish and I'm also being catty with all the women in the game, like I'm a Real Housewife.
Look, Dennis, I-I'm six-foot-ten.
I have always wanted to be six-foot-ten.
Hey, look, Mac, you're five- foot-nine, and Frank, you're a man... an ugly, old man!
You're not understanding this, Dennis, but I think I have something that could help you wrap your head around it.
("All Night Long" by Lionel Richie playing)
I've never had my hair cut in a bedroom.
Well, one thing I've learned from cutting hair all these years, Danielle, is you don't have to go to a high-end salon to get a high-end salon-quality cut.
Little spritz?
Why are we watching Dennis' sex tape?
Shh.
It's cold.
I know.
Well, we'll make it hot in a minute, don't worry about that.
(Dennis and woman chuckle)
(Frank groans)
Well, don't...
Well, it's always... there's always so much, so much preamble.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Oh, oh, um, all right.
All right.
Whoa.
Now, Dennis, how does this make you feel?
Powerful.
Yes, of course, but how does it affect you sexually?
I'm very aroused right now.
I, too, am aroused.
I'm starting to swell up.
Yeah.
See, now all three of us are aroused, and there's not a woman in the room.
See, this is no different than sports or video games.
It's all a virtual experience.
No, no, no, bullshit, this was real, okay, this happened, I did this.
All right, I drew this woman in, I styled her hair, I entered her with almost no resistance.
I did these things.
You say it's real, but what even is reality?
Yeah, who knows?
We don't even know if we're in this room.
We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space.
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna go out into the real world again today and have real experiences.
I'm gonna draw those people in to me, okay?
A turtle's dream.
That's crazy, lunacy.
So, tell me something, Queen of Thrones, how about we stop being enemies, we start becoming friends here, huh?
Charlie, I just got a new nose and I'm flying to Miami to get my lips inflated.
Can you hang on one second?
What, Dee, what are you buying?
How are you paying for that?
We have plenty of money.
I know we have money.
We have money because I...
All right, you know what?
Yes, fine, buy your lips, buy your noses, buy whatever you're gonna buy.
All right, don't interrupt me when I'm running our tribe, okay, 'cause that's kind of a big deal.
I know, I'm sorry.
All right, so don't interrupt.
Okay.
Do me a favor, refill my bowl of energy balls, okay?
Please make yourself useful.
Sorry about that, Queen of Thrones, let me step into my office here.
Hey, bitch!
Frank, you are SweetPeaches69?
How did you get so many followers?
What can I say?
Some girls are more popular than others.
Are you wearing a mink coat?
What, this old thing?
Guy gave it to me for going down on him.
I've been getting a lot of gifts lately.
I just got sent a whole box of peaches... real ones.
I'm eating like a goddamn islander.
I'm living a pretty classy life these days.
Ooh, you should come to my party.
I'm gonna meet a lot of my online friends there.
It's gonna be a very classy affair, but you can come anyway.
(Frank laughs)
Well, look, we can sit here, we can talk cheesesteaks all day long, but maybe you and I could get together at my bar, settle this thing once and for all.
Charlie, we got to talk.
Whoa.
We're going to a party... a real one...
Frank's throwing it.
Yes, I know what's going on.
I know everything that's happening.
Do you know he has a bunch of followers?
Do you know that he's parading around in a mink coat, and he humiliated me?
I'm a queen, okay?
I should be the one wearing mink and I should be throwing digs at him.
You know what I mean?
I should have a lot more followers.
You want mink, Dee, you want a mink coat?
You want a nice, real mink coat, not a virtual one like Frank?
Don't dick around with this.
Are you serious?
I am dead serious.
I trade with a guy online;
He has a clothing store.
I'm sure I could give him some crops, maybe a follower or two, and he'll give you a mink coat.
For me?
Would you like that?
I would love that.
You, you would like that, wouldn't you?
You know how that's not gonna happen?
What?
It's not gonna happen if I'm not playing the goddamn game!
Because when I'm not playing the game, people are attacking our tribe, okay, and that's a lot of pressure, that's a lot of stress.
It's too much for you.
And we could lose everything, we could lose everything that we have worked for... everything!
I wasn't thinking.
No, you're not really the thinking kind, though.
I'm kind of the thinking one in the relationship, so...
Right, thank you.
Be pretty, you know, talk to me right.
Yeah.
Get my energy balls.
(Sweet Dee gasps)
Unbelievable.
Hey, Charlie, we need to talk, dude.
(laughing):
Well, well, well, if it isn't the soiled fool.
Frank told you about that?
Uh, no, everyone's talking about it online; it's hilarious.
You destroyed your computer, you bashed it to bits.
I'm assuming it got you in the eye...
is that what's going on there?
It bashed me back a little bit.
Yeah, you should win those fights, you shouldn't lose...
I did win, I did win, it just got a couple of good shots in.
It did, yeah.
Hey, Charlie, hey, listen, I want to tell you something.
Um, Dee...
Yeah?
You're not going to offer our guest any?
Of course I... of course, that's what I was doing.
Yeah.
Hey, Mac, hey, did you, did you want an energy ball or two?
Yeah.
Go ahead, have as many as you want... is that enough?
That's... yeah, that's good.
There you go, okay.
Okay, you need to fuel up.
Have a bunch of balls.
Yeah, I do, thank you.
Okay, thank you.
Okay... don't touch.
No, now I know.
Right, yeah.
I didn't mean that.
And stop groveling, just...
Let me know if you need...
You're not pretty when you do that, so...
Wow, you, like, totally psychologically, like, annihilated her.
Yeah.
You're good at building, I'm good at destroying.
We should totally team up.
Wait, you know what?
Can you do me a favor?
Can you watch her for a little while while I go meet a girl that I met online?
A real girl?
Yeah, a real girl.
She's probably fat, right?
Probably very fat, yeah.
If she's got any fat friends, I'm, I'm in.
If she has any fat friends, I'll let you know.
Or ugly.
Yeah, or ugly.
If they're sick, that's fine, too.
Yeah, or ugly or sick or, or male or female or whatever it is that you like.
That's not the point.
Like, the point is, you know how women get.
You know, she catches wind that I'm meeting a girl, she's going to go...
Oh, totally, totally.
I hate women.
Yeah, I-I know that you feel that way, but do what I'm asking and then I can help you out with the game.
Okay, do what?
Watch Dee.
Oh, okay, yeah.
Hello, hi.
Anyone?
Come on, hello, hi.
God, it's unbelievable.
Does anybody want to experience this?
Anyone want to experience me?
For real?
Oasis Sensory Deprivation.
Enter a new dimension.
Change your perception.
Experience a new reality.
Experience a new reality.
Stop getting invested in fake realities!
I'm six foot, ten.
You're five foot, nine.
(babbles)
What even is reality?
This is real.
(brays)
How do you do?
We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space.
(sighs)
(British accent):
What is real?
Is this real?
Am I?
Who are you?
Oh, I'm you.
Huh.
That's an amazing accent.
I like yours as well.
I think I know what reality is, but maybe I don't.
Everything in life is becoming more and more virtual.
Aw, don't be such a wanker.
Life is all in your mind.
If you believe it to be real, then it's real.
I'm so confused, British Dennis.
You create your own reality.
I've known beggars to be kings and kings to be beggars, all because they believed it so.
It's your choice.
It's my choice.
It's your universe.
It's my universe.
And you are God.
I... am...
God.
Oh... oh... oh, no... okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
(sighs)
(grunts)
(moans)
Charlie?
Hey.
Julie, right?
The Queen of Thrones!
(chuckling)
The second most powerful player in the game.
And you are the Mighty Rat Slayer.
'Tis I, 'tis I!
It's nice to meet you!
Yeah, I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, I haven't had a chance to tidy myself.
You know, when you're playing the game, you get caught up and...
Have a seat!
Have a seat!
Wow, this is...
It's cool to meet someone from the game, you know?
I brought you something.
You did?
It's nothing, really.
It's just, um... the best cheesecake in Philadelphia.
(laughs)
You dog!
Uh, I'll be the judge of that, all right?
You little rascal, you.
Uh, I don't normally meet people from the game, but you seem like such a nice guy.
Thanks, yeah, yeah, you know...
This is embarrassing, but I got you something too, you know?
I don't want...
I don't want to make you feel weird but here.
Oh, how thoughtful.
I wonder what it is.
It's not much.
Just a box of spiders.
(screams) What the hell?
Well, while we've been sitting here, my followers have burned your land, they've raped your people, and they've destroyed your tribe.
You thought you could make a move on me, Queen of Thrones?
Well, you were wrong.
What?
I just wanted to have lunch with you.
Oh, right.
Oh, let's have lunch because we're hungry and we want to eat food.
Bullshit!
You think I'd give up all this for lunch?
You stupid, fat pig.
I'm not fat.
No, you're not fat, but you were...
you were supposed to be.
My friend Mac said you would be fat.
Whatever.
You're a dick.
And your breath smells like dog food.
(shouts)
Whatever, you bitch!
I got the power now!
I'm doing good in the game, so I'm doing good in life!
(panting)
Oh, look who's here.
Well, it's nice that you came.
A little overdressed.
You said that this was a classy affair, Frank.
It was a classy affair until you showed up.
(laughing)
You bitch!
Where are your 101 Dalmatians tonight?
(laughing)
He's better at the zings than you!
All right, Dee, give me your phone, give me your headset...
I got to get back online ASAP.
I just made some big things happen.
Big things, baby!
Boom!
No.
She's not with you anymore, bro.
Hold on.
Shut up.
Wh-Why is the soiled fool talking to me?
I don't need you anymore, Charlie.
I'd like a divorce.
Ooh!
Juicy!
Wait, what are you talking about?
I know you were gonna leave me for the Queen of Thrones, so
I've slept with Mac to humiliate you.
(chuckles)
She's humiliated you and herself by sleeping with me.
I'm good at the game now.
Oh, my God, Dee, you stupid idiot.
Do you... do you have a brain in your head?
I was tricking that girl, so that I could destroy her tribe.
We're the most powerful tribe in the whole game now!
What are you doing?
!
(gasps)
Uh... you know, I-I guess maybe I hadn't really thought the whole thing through.
No, you didn't think!
Because you don't think!
You're just a stupid kept housewife, okay?
Zing it, girl!
Frank, shut the hell up!
How dare you all conspire against me?
How dare you?
!
You know what, I want everyone out.
Everyone get out of my apartment, okay?
No, not you, not you, and not you.
The three of you, sit!
Get out!
Okay, I think we can all agree that this game is the most important thing that ever happened to us, right?
Absolutely, yeah...
It's very important...
That's the truth.
It's a hugely important thing!
So because I'm a nice guy, you know, 'cause I'm a cool dude,
I'll let you live, all right?
But, Mac and Frank, you got to give me your shares of Paddy's Pub.
Done!
What?
Yes!
And, Dee, you're gonna have to do all the Charlie-work in the bar from here until... oh, I don't know... how's eternity sound?
(bad British accent):
Stop...
This game has gone on long enough.
(normal voice):
Uh, shit.
Are you doing an accent?
Yeah, I was doing a British acc...
It was a British accent.
That was British?
!
Yeah, I had it so good in my head... uh, I was doing a really good British accent.
Doesn't matter.
Anyway...
Charlie, you think you have all the power?
Well, you don't.
You see, the only thing bigger than a king is a god.
You think you're a god?
I'm the one who's thriving, Dennis.
I mean, look at me.
You look like you're covered in Hawaiian Punch.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Eh.
I am the god of my own universe, Charlie.
I decide my own reality, and I've decided all of your realities as well.
So, you see, I unplugged it.
You... unplugged reality?
I don't understand what he's saying.
Me neither.
I just...
I deleted all of your characters from the game.
What?
I erased all your... people.
H-How did you do that?
Well, it was easy.
You guys all have the same password, "paddyspub."
Oh, that's my password for everything.
Mine, too.
Why would you do that though?
Why would you delete our characters?
Because the goddamn game was irritating to me.
I thought it was really stupid, and it really is just, you know, sort of that simple, so I ended the game, you know.
That's the end.
Doesn't have to be a whole big thing every single time, you know.
That's life.
That's just sort of how-how shit goes.
(chuckles)
Sometimes things just sort of... end.
♪ All night long ♪
♪ All night ♪
You were disrespectful to me.
That's the past.
God, get a life.
This is my life, bitch.
You bitch!
Aw, you slut.
FRANK:
Ah, hold still, Charlie-- you're flickering.
CHARLIE:
Sorry, it's...
I'm trying to get you good images, but I keep getting shocked a little bit.
MAC:
Well, don't let that affect your work.
No, I'm really trying not to.
It's just that, you know, I have to run the wires from the other building...
Building and, you know, there's asbestos in the ducts, which...
Good for breathing, so I'm tired.
DENNIS:
Why are you watching this crap?
Come on, turn the TV off.
Let's go out, let's do something-
- I'm bored.
Hey, let's go dancing, huh?
I want to do something.
Dancing?
We're watching Real Housewives.
You know, there's nothing real about this shit, Frank.
You know that, come on.
Real women don't even look like that.
SWEET DEE:
Hey, guys.
That is what real women look like.
Dee, are you sick?
No, I feel great.
Oh, I haven't had a chance to shower for a few days.
I've been gaming like a loon.
You've been what?
Gaming-
- I've been playing this online video game.
It is awesome.
Charlie, speaking of which, you want to come play my avatar for a little bit while I run some errands?
I don't want my crops to die.
Nah, I'm kind of busy working for the guys at the ele... (groans) Shit!
Yes, he's working for us.
He will do nothing of the sort.
We're going dancing.
Come on!
What if I give you three bucks?
Hey, you're our employee.
You do what we say.
I pay your rent.
Do not drop those wires!
Hey, Charlie, to live is to dance.
Let's go.
Charlie, what if I gave you five bucks?
You owe me five bucks!
(electrical snap)
(Charlie yells)
Ah, shit!
Screw it!
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go with Dee, okay?
But I'm getting sick of this shit, I really am.
You treat me like a dumb-dumb and a grunt, and I have potential, you know?
(panting)
I can go places, I can do things.
Who knows?
I might even rule the world one day.
Rule the world, huh?
Yeah, if that happens, I'll blow myself.
(sighs)
Okay, so it's called TechPocalypse, right?
And we're post-apocalypse, and we have to rebuild civilization.
This is me, ZingingCutie23.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down!
ZingingCutie 23.
Are you pretending that you're 23 years old?
- No.
- It seems like it.
No, I...
It's...
I...
It's a random number that I picked.
It's a random number?
It's a number to put at the end of that.
You know what?
Just watch over my tribe, and make sure nobody, you know, takes it over, and I'll give you your money, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Wait.
Hold on a second.
What is that?
That's you.
You're one of my subjects.
That's me.
Why am I in the game?
Is that Mac?
Of course that's Mac.
You guys are all here.
See, Mac's my handmaiden.
How do you do?
How do you do?
And Dennis is a midget blacksmith.
(Dennis character babbles)
Frank is a mutant half-donkey.
(braying)
And you're my jester.
Why am I eating out of a trough?
Made sense.
Are you kidding me?
So let me get this straight.
You've been playing this game for, like, a week straight just so you feel like you lord over all of us?
Is that what this is?
Charlie, do you want your five bucks or not?
I want my five dollars.
It's just pathetic, Dee.
Okay, well, maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.
I really do need the money, though.
Yeah, well, then get to work.
Can you give me an advance?
No, not in advance.
We'll see how well you do.
All right, I got this.
I got this.
(dance music plays)
Yeah.
See, this is what I'm talking about, guys, huh?
I mean, playing online video games and watching stupid reality shows-- that's not real life.
It's keeping people from experiencing real life.
Yeah?
This is real.
It's real, but it feels weird as shit.
There's nobody else in the bar dancing.
We're setting the tone, Frank.
Yeah, we will lead, and others will follow.
I'm stopping.
Oh, come on, don't stop.
Look, all right, let's go do some shots, and that will get you guys fired up, and we'll come back out, and we'll do some more of this or whatever.
You know, you can do the move, and...
well, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey, uh, bartender, three shots of whiskey, come on.
Hey, I know you guys.
You're the donkey man and the princess, right?
We don't know what you're talking about.
Take a hike, Bozo.
Geek.
Check it out.
Look at this.
This is... this is you, right?
This-this is Frank and-and Mac from ZingingCutie's tribe?
What the hell is this?
This is Dee's online video game, and she's created characters for all of us.
She's humiliating us virtually.
Who cares?
It's a video game.
What do you mean, who cares?
This is starting to piss me off.
Stop getting invested in fake realities.
Let's live real life!
Well, Dennis, my anger feels very real.
Are you feeling it?
Are you feeling it?
Yeah, well, it's not real.
It's not.
I-I-I...
I'm angry.
Okay, it's not real, and you know what it also isn't?
It also isn't epic, okay?
And you know what is epic?
Doing these shots, going out there and dancing.
Come on, do it, do the shots.
I'll do the shots.
I'll just do the shots.
How about that?
Mm-hmm.
(groaning)
(grunting)
(high-pitched humming)
Oh, somebody got a smart phone.
Okay, you know, I tell you what, Carl.
Let's settle for a C trade.
We'll call it a day on that.
I got to run.
ZingingCutie44 is back, so I'm out.
(laughing):
Changed your name.
What the hell are you doing, Charlie?
I told you to just feed my crops.
I did, I fed your crops, and then I gathered some rocks, and
I built a little wall around your tribe.
Then I used the leftover rocks to dam the river so that you could fish.
Now you're doing well in the game.
You sucked at it, all right?
All you did was spend your money on stuff you don't need, just like in real life.
I don't do that in real life.
Yes, you do.
What did you get at the store?
I bought a smart phone so that I can play the game on the go.
What's going on with the fingernails?
Well, I had those done like Flo-Jo.
Why?
!
It's craziness.
I just thought it would be funny.
I...
Dee, this is your problem.
I could take this money, I could feed myself for a month.
I would buy milk, I would buy flour, I'd buy vitamins, I'd boil them down to little energy balls to sustain me, but whatever.
Forget it.
Enjoy your game, enjoy all your new followers, and you're welcome.
Oh, shit!
Charlie, you got me 31 new followers?
Yeah.
That's amazing!
Hey, do you want to maybe team up?
No, 'cause I don't want to be a slave.
Come on, Charlie, please.
I need you.
It's, like, when I'm doing good in the game, I'm doing good in life.
Oh, I want to make fun of you for saying that, but I kind of know what you mean.
It's like I'm thriving.
You are thriving.
Yeah, I did feel that, and I...
You felt that?
I did, I felt that, you know, and I never get to thrive.
I want to be the guy who thrives for once.
Right?
Me, neither.
All right, I'll tell you what-- make me your king, and let's get rocking.
Ew, no.
I don't want to do that 'cause we'd have to be married, and that would be awful.
Oh, okay, I'll see you later.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
I'll make you my king; just accept my request to consummate.
Consummate?
What is that?
Have sex.
Oh.
So, um, we should have sex then?
In the game.
Yeah, in the game, sure, yeah.
Yeah.
Either way.
Uh, so, push enter hard, or one, like, slow push, and you do your thing, or a little circular action?
Just push the button, Charlie.
Just push the button.
(Charlie grunts)
(sighs)
That was good, right?
Was it?
I think.
You see me, Frank, you see me coming?
I see you, I see you.
Oh, here comes another guy.
I'm gonna fight him.
Mac attack!
Fight!
I lost again!
Goddamn it, how do I keep losing?
I'm huge.
Stop fighting every guy in the game.
The fighting is the best part.
It's the only reason I'm playing.
Oh, my God, will you guys please shut up?
I'm hungover as shit.
We're playing TechPocalypse.
(Dennis groans)
Mac is a soiled fool, and I am a gorgeous girl with big cans and
I'm banging all the fishermen in sight for fish and I'm also being catty with all the women in the game, like I'm a Real Housewife.
Look, Dennis, I-I'm six-foot- ten.
I have always wanted to be six- foot-ten.
Hey, look, Mac, you're five- foot-nine, and Frank, you're a man-- an ugly, old man!
You're not understanding this, Dennis, but I think I have something that could help you wrap your head around it.
("All Night Long" by Lionel Richie playing)
I've never had my hair cut in a bedroom.
Well, one thing I've learned from cutting hair all these years, Danielle, is you don't have to go to a high-end salon to get a high-end salon-quality cut.
Little spritz?
Why are we watching Dennis' sex tape?
Shh.
It's cold.
I know.
Well, we'll make it hot in a minute, don't worry about that.
(Dennis and woman chuckle)
(Frank groans)
Well, don't...
Well, it's always-- there's always so much, so much preamble.
Okay, here we go.
Okay.
Oh, oh, um, all right.
All right.
Whoa.
Now, Dennis, how does this make you feel?
Powerful.
Yes, of course, but how does it affect you sexually?
I'm very aroused right now.
I, too, am aroused.
I'm starting to swell up.
Yeah.
See, now all three of us are aroused, and there's not a woman in the room.
See, this is no different than sports or video games.
It's all a virtual experience.
No, no, no, bullshit, this was real, okay, this happened, I did this.
All right, I drew this woman in, I styled her hair, I entered her with almost no resistance.
I did these things.
You say it's real, but what even is reality?
Yeah, who knows?
We don't even know if we're in this room.
We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space.
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna go out into the real world again today and have real experiences.
I'm gonna draw those people in to me, okay?
A turtle's dream.
That's crazy, lunacy.
So, tell me something, Queen of Thrones, how about we stop being enemies, we start becoming friends here, huh?
Charlie, I just got a new nose and I'm flying to Miami to get my lips inflated.
Can you hang on one second?
What, Dee, what are you buying?
How are you paying for that?
We have plenty of money.
I know we have money.
We have money because I...
All right, you know what?
Yes, fine, buy your lips, buy your noses, buy whatever you're gonna buy.
All right, don't interrupt me when I'm running our tribe, okay, 'cause that's kind of a big deal.
I know, I'm sorry.
All right, so don't interrupt.
Okay.
Do me a favor, refill my bowl of energy balls, okay?
Please make yourself useful.
Sorry about that, Queen of Thrones, let me step into my office here.
Hey, bitch!
Frank, you are SweetPeaches69?
How did you get so many followers?
What can I say?
Some girls are more popular than others.
Are you wearing a mink coat?
What, this old thing?
Guy gave it to me for going down on him.
I've been getting a lot of gifts lately.
I just got sent a whole box of peaches-- real ones.
I'm eating like a goddamn islander.
I'm living a pretty classy life these days.
Ooh, you should come to my party.
I'm gonna meet a lot of my online friends there.
It's gonna be a very classy affair, but you can come anyway.
(Frank laughs)
Well, look, we can sit here, we can talk cheesesteaks all day long, but maybe you and I could get together at my bar, settle this thing once and for all.
Charlie, we got to talk.
Whoa.
We're going to a party-- a real one-
- Frank's throwing it.
Yes, I know what's going on.
I know everything that's happening.
Do you know he has a bunch of followers?
Do you know that he's parading around in a mink coat, and he humiliated me?
I'm a queen, okay?
I should be the one wearing mink and I should be throwing digs at him.
You know what I mean?
I should have a lot more followers.
You want mink, Dee, you want a mink coat?
You want a nice, real mink coat, not a virtual one like Frank?
Don't dick around with this.
Are you serious?
I am dead serious.
I trade with a guy online;
he has a clothing store.
I'm sure I could give him some crops, maybe a follower or two, and he'll give you a mink coat.
For me?
Would you like that?
I would love that.
You, you would like that, wouldn't you?
You know how that's not gonna happen?
What?
It's not gonna happen if I'm not playing the goddamn game!
Because when I'm not playing the game, people are attacking our tribe, okay, and that's a lot of pressure, that's a lot of stress.
It's too much for you.
And we could lose everything, we could lose everything that we have worked for-- everything!
I wasn't thinking.
No, you're not really the thinking kind, though.
I'm kind of the thinking one in the relationship, so...
Right, thank you.
Be pretty, you know, talk to me right.
Yeah.
Get my energy balls.
(Sweet Dee gasps)
Unbelievable.
Hey, Charlie, we need to talk, dude.
(laughing):
Well, well, well, if it isn't the soiled fool.
Frank told you about that?
Uh, no, everyone's talking about it online; it's hilarious.
You destroyed your computer, you bashed it to bits.
I'm assuming it got you in the eye-- is that what's going on there?
It bashed me back a little bit.
Yeah, you should win those fights, you shouldn't lose...
I did win, I did win, it just got a couple of good shots in.
It did, yeah.
Hey, Charlie, hey, listen, I want to tell you something.
Um, Dee...
Yeah?
You're not going to offer our guest any?
Of course I-- of course, that's what I was doing.
Yeah.
Hey, Mac, hey, did you, did you want an energy ball or two?
Yeah.
Go ahead, have as many as you want-- is that enough?
That's-- yeah, that's good.
There you go, okay.
Okay, you need to fuel up.
Have a bunch of balls.
Yeah, I do, thank you.
Okay, thank you.
Okay-- don't touch.
No, now I know.
Right, yeah.
I didn't mean that.
And stop groveling, just...
Let me know if you need...
You're not pretty when you do that, so...
Wow, you, like, totally psychologically, like, annihilated her.
Yeah.
You're good at building, I'm good at destroying.
We should totally team up.
Wait, you know what?
Can you do me a favor?
Can you watch her for a little while while I go meet a girl that I met online?
A real girl?
Yeah, a real girl.
She's probably fat, right?
Probably very fat, yeah.
If she's got any fat friends, I'm, I'm in.
If she has any fat friends, I'll let you know.
Or ugly.
Yeah, or ugly.
If they're sick, that's fine, too.
Yeah, or ugly or sick or, or male or female or whatever it is that you like.
That's not the point.
Like, the point is, you know how women get.
You know, she catches wind that I'm meeting a girl, she's going to go...
Oh, totally, totally.
I hate women.
Yeah, I-I know that you feel that way, but do what I'm asking and then I can help you out with the game.
Okay, do what?
Watch Dee.
Oh, okay, yeah.
Hello, hi.
Anyone?
Come on, hello, hi.
God, it's unbelievable.
Does anybody want to experience this?
Anyone want to experience me?
For real?
Oasis Sensory Deprivation.

Change your perception.
Experience a new reality.

Stop getting invested in fake realities!
I'm six foot, ten.
You're five foot, nine.
(babbles)
What even is reality?
This is real.
(brays)
How do you do?
We could be in a turtle's dream in outer space.
(sighs)
(British accent):
What is real?
Is this real?
Am I?
Who are you?
Oh, I'm you.
Huh.
That's an amazing accent.
I like yours as well.
I think I know what reality is, but maybe I don't.
Everything in life is becoming more and more virtual.
Aw, don't be such a wanker.
Life is all in your mind.
If you believe it to be real, then it's real.
I'm so confused, British Dennis.
You create your own reality.
I've known beggars to be kings and kings to be beggars, all because they believed it so.
It's your choice.
It's my choice.
It's your universe.
It's my universe.
And you are God.
I... am...
God.
Oh... oh... oh, no... okay.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
(sighs)
(grunts)
(moans)
Charlie?
Hey.
Julie, right?
The Queen of Thrones!
(chuckling)
The second most powerful player in the game.
And you are the Mighty Rat Slayer.
'Tis I, 'tis I!
It's nice to meet you!
Yeah, I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, I haven't had a chance to tidy myself.
You know, when you're playing the game, you get caught up and...
Have a seat!
Have a seat!
Wow, this is...
It's cool to meet someone from the game, you know?
I brought you something.
You did?
It's nothing, really.
It's just, um... the best cheesecake in Philadelphia.
(laughs)
You dog!
Uh, I'll be the judge of that, all right?
You little rascal, you.
Uh, I don't normally meet people from the game, but you seem like such a nice guy.
Thanks, yeah, yeah, you know...
This is embarrassing, but I got you something too, you know?
I don't want...
I don't want to make you feel weird but here.
Oh, how thoughtful.
I wonder what it is.
It's not much.
Just a box of spiders.
(screams) What the hell?
Well, while we've been sitting here, my followers have burned your land, they've raped your people, and they've destroyed your tribe.
You thought you could make a move on me, Queen of Thrones?
Well, you were wrong.
What?
I just wanted to have lunch with you.
Oh, right.
Oh, let's have lunch because we're hungry and we want to eat food.
Bullshit!
You think I'd give up all this for lunch?
You stupid, fat pig.
I'm not fat.
No, you're not fat, but you were...
you were supposed to be.
My friend Mac said you would be fat.
Whatever.
You're a dick.
And your breath smells like dog food.
(shouts)
Whatever, you bitch!
I got the power now!
I'm doing good in the game, so I'm doing good in life!
(panting)
Oh, look who's here.
Well, it's nice that you came.
A little overdressed.
You said that this was a classy affair, Frank.
It was a classy affair until you showed up.
(laughing)
You bitch!
Where are your 101 Dalmatians tonight?
(laughing)
He's better at the zings than you!
All right, Dee, give me your phone, give me your headset-
- I got to get back online ASAP.
I just made some big things happen.
Big things, baby!
Boom!
No.
She's not with you anymore, bro.
Hold on.
Shut up.
Wh-Why is the soiled fool talking to me?
I don't need you anymore, Charlie.
I'd like a divorce.
Ooh!
Juicy!
Wait, what are you talking about?
I know you were gonna leave me for the Queen of Thrones, so
I've slept with Mac to humiliate you.
(chuckles)
She's humiliated you and herself by sleeping with me.
I'm good at the game now.
Oh, my God, Dee, you stupid idiot.
Do you... do you have a brain in your head?
I was tricking that girl, so that I could destroy her tribe.
We're the most powerful tribe in the whole game now!
What are you doing?
!
(gasps)
Uh... you know, I-I guess maybe I hadn't really thought the whole thing through.
No, you didn't think!
Because you don't think!
You're just a stupid kept housewife, okay?
Zing it, girl!
Frank, shut the hell up!
How dare you all conspire against me?
How dare you?
!
You know what, I want everyone out.
Everyone get out of my apartment, okay?
No, not you, not you, and not you.
The three of you, sit!
Get out!
Okay, I think we can all agree that this game is the most important thing that ever happened to us, right?
Absolutely, yeah...
It's very important...
That's the truth.
It's a hugely important thing!
So because I'm a nice guy, you know, 'cause I'm a cool dude,
I'll let you live, all right?
But, Mac and Frank, you got to give me your shares of Paddy's Pub.
Done!
What?
Yes!
And, Dee, you're gonna have to do all the Charlie-work in the bar from here until-- oh, I don't know-- how's eternity sound?
(bad British accent):
Stop...
This game has gone on long enough.
(normal voice):
Uh, shit.
Are you doing an accent?
Yeah, I was doing a British acc...
It was a British accent.
That was British?
!
Yeah, I had it so good in my head-- uh, I was doing a really good British accent.
Doesn't matter.
Anyway...
Charlie, you think you have all the power?
Well, you don't.
You see, the only thing bigger than a king is a god.
You think you're a god?
I'm the one who's thriving, Dennis.
I mean, look at me.
You look like you're covered in Hawaiian Punch.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Eh.
I am the god of my own universe, Charlie.
I decide my own reality, and I've decided all of your realities as well.
So, you see, I unplugged it.
You... unplugged reality?
I don't understand what he's saying.
Me neither.
I just...
I deleted all of your characters from the game.
What?
I erased all your... people.
H-How did you do that?
Well, it was easy.
You guys all have the same password, "paddyspub."
Oh, that's my password for everything.
Mine, too.
Why would you do that though?
Why would you delete our characters?
Because the goddamn game was irritating to me.
I thought it was really stupid, and it really is just, you know, sort of that simple, so I ended the game, you know.
That's the end.
Doesn't have to be a whole big thing every single time, you know.
That's life.
That's just sort of how-how shit goes.
(chuckles)
Sometimes things just sort of... end.

In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young man.
His name
- Merlin.
SNEEZING
You're still angry with me, aren't you?
We spend the entire day hunting, catch nothing, because every time we got anywhere near anything you sneezed and frightened it away.
Not the last time.
No.
That time you fell into a stream.
No-one could accuse you of being predictable, Merlin.
I think I'm getting a cold.
Let's hope it's a bad one.
SCREAM
What was that?
I think it was a bird.
SCREAM
That?
That was definitely a woman screaming.
Why couldn't it have just been a bird?
It's never just a bird.
SCREAMS AND CRIES
SCREAMS CONTINUE
What are you doing?
I assume you want to risk our lives and see what's going on.
I never thought I'd say this, Merlin, but you're learning.
Let the woman go.
This woman has been sentenced to death.
It does not concern you.
I am Arthur Pendragon, King of Camelot, and your village is in my lands.
Her sorcery has brought sickness and suffering to this village.
Did she receive a fair trial?
Your father would have shown her no mercy.
I am not my father.
Now cut her down.
I will not endanger the lives of all who live here.
I said... cut her down.
Is there anything more you can do for her?
She won't make it through the night.
Make her as comfortable as possible.
Thank you.
You should try and get some rest.
My time has come.
When you have lived as long as I, you no longer fear the journey to the next world.
I have a gift for you.
You showed kindness, and compassion.
Those are the qualities of a true king.
Open it.
It's beautiful.
It has the power to summon the spirits of the dead.
GASPING
GASPS GROW FAINTER
The Horn of Cathbhadh.
When Uther attacked the Isle of the Blessed, the Horn of Cathbhadh was smuggled to safety before the temple fell.
It hasn't been heard of since.
The old woman said it could be used to open the door to the spirit world?
I have seen it with my own eyes.
Long before the time of the Great Purge I took part in such ceremonies.
Each year at Beltain, the High Priestesses would gather at the Great Stones of Nemeton and summon the spirits of their ancestors.
It holds powerful magic.
You must keep it safe.
HUBBUB OF CONVERSATION AND MUSIC
He's always like this at the anniversary of his coronation.
I thought it was a cause for celebration?
It is, but it's also the anniversary of Uther's death.

What are you doing?
Nothing...
Thinking.
You, thinking?
Well, now I'm really getting worried.
Shut up.
Leave it!
Why?
Because I'm telling you to and I'm the King of Camelot, not that that seems to mean anything to you.
Ready the horses and gather some supplies.
Where are we going?
You don't need to know.
Do not breathe a word of this to anyone.
Not even Guinevere.
You're threatening me with a spoon?
SLAP
Ow!
I'm getting a very bad feeling about this place.
That is because you're a coward.
No.
It's because I value my life and I don't want to die horribly.
Fair point.
So, are we going to turn back?
No.
What are they?
The Great Stones of Nemeton.
You're going to use it?
This will be the only chance I have to see my father again.
I can't let it pass.
This is powerful magic.
My father was taken from me before his time.
Now there isn't a day that passes when I don't think of the things I wish I'd said to him.
If you were given the same chance to see your father, talk to him.
Wouldn't you do the same?
HORN SOUNDS A PLAINTIVE NOTE
Father.
Arthur.
I thought I would never see you again.
There isn't a day that passes when I don't think of you.
And I, you.
There are times when I feel so alone,
I wish more than anything that you were by my side.
If I were at your side,
I fear you would not like all that I have to say.
What do you mean?
Many of the decisions you have made since you have become King go against all that I taught you.
I have done what I have believed to be right.
You have ignored our tradition, our ancient laws.
You have allowed common men to become knights.
They are some of the finest knights that Camelot's ever known.
They would gladly give their lives for the kingdom.
They question your decisions.
They make you look weak.
Listening to others is a sign of strength, not weakness.
How do you expect anyone to fear a King who does not know his own mind?
I don't want my people to respect me because they fear me.
Then they will not respect you at all.
Your marriage should have served to form an alliance with another kingdom and you choose to marry a serving girl.
I married for love.
I love Guinevere.
More than...
I can express.
There are some things that are more important than love.
It is your duty to strengthen and protect the kingdom.
You have failed.
I have always strived to make you proud.
How can I be proud of a son who ignores everything that I taught him?
Who is destroying my legacy?
I have brought peace to the kingdom...
At what price?
The peace cannot last.
If you are not strong, the kingdom will fall.
You must go now.
I need more time.
There is still so much I wish to say.
If you stay, you will be forever trapped in the world of the dead.
You must go now.
Go.
This can't be the last time I will ever see you.
Think about everything that I have said to you.
It isn't too late.
Now go.
I will always love you, Arthur.
Arthur?
Do you want to talk about it?
What happened at the stones?
It seems my father doesn't approve of the way
I have chosen to rule his kingdom.
You mean YOUR kingdom.
The things he said about the knights, about marrying Guinevere.
What if he's right?
What if I have weakened Camelot?
Do you really believe that?
You have always done what you believed to be right.
People respect you.
Thank you, Merlin.
Some people still think you're a foolish, arrogant ass.
Who?
Very funny.
We should get some sleep.
We covered the area from Pawlett down to Meldreth.
This includes 30 troops at Bawtry.
15 at Talan.
Ten at Chime.
Nine at Brune.
RUMBLING
11 at Burwelle...
CRASH
I want the table repaired before the next council meeting.
Are you listening to me, Merlin?
What?
Sorry.
I was just thinking about what happened.
Did you get a terrible fright?
Yes.
My heart nearly jumped out through my mouth.
Oh, well maybe you should have the rest of the day off and put your feet up?
Really?
You were joking?
There really is no limit to your intelligence, is there, Merlin?

The axe must have fallen off the rack.
I'm surprised that a falling axe would cause such a deep wound.
Not as surprised as I was.
Quite.
You were lucky you weren't more severely injured.
It's strange...
What's that?
Just before it happened.
I sensed something, like there was someone there, watching me.
I'm sure it was just my mind playing tricks on me.
Apply a second poultice in the morning.
And no training.
Thank you, Gaius.
EERIE WHISTLING
Is there something wrong, Merlin?
Merlin, I get the distinct impression there is something you're not telling me.
No.
Why would you say that?
Because there usually is.
We went to the Stones of Nemeton.
Merlin, I warned you of the dangers...
I tried to stop him.
He was insistent.
What is it, Merlin?
After the candelabra fell,
I was in the corridor outside the Council Chambers.
I could sense something.
It was like Percival said, a presence of some kind.
In the days of the Old Religion, the priestesses trained for years before entering into the spirit world.
It was fraught with dangers.
There was one thing they were schooled never to do.
As the veil closed, they were never to look back at the spirit.
What happened if they did?
They'd release the spirit into this world.
Arthur must have looked back.
What?
At the Stones of Nemeton, I think that you may have released your father's spirit.
And what makes you think that?
Did you look back?
As the veil closed, did you look back at your father?
I may have glanced round for a second.
In that second, you unleashed Uther's spirit.
All these strange things that have been happening?
The candelabra falling onto the Round Table.
Yes, because the chain broke.
The axe falling on Percival.
It was an accident.
Was it?
Do you really expect me to believe that my father's spirit is responsible for these things?
The Round Table represents everything that's changed since you became King.
You told me how Uther disapproved.
He's angry with you and that makes him dangerous.
I know my father.
He wouldn't do these things.
I think he'd do anything to protect his legacy.
Who knows what he's capable of?
Enough!
That's enough.
Leave me.

I know how hard this is for you.
Gaius, how is she?
Smoke has entered her lungs, but with time she will heal.
I have given her a sleeping draft.
She was lucky to escape with her life.
I've always known my father could be cruel, but why would he do this to Guinevere?
He knows how much I love her.
Gaius.
What do you know about ghosts?
We must force Uther's spirit to return to the other world before he does any more harm.
We must use The Horn of Cathbhadh to reopen the veil between the worlds.
But we must remember one thing... only the person who summoned the spirit can force it from this world.

When I became King, more than anything, I wanted to make him proud.
What is it?
You've always done what you believed to be right even if you knew your father would disapprove of it.
Do you not see how different you are to him?

I know it's you, Father.
Why are you doing this?
I did not spend my entire life building this kingdom to see my own son destroy it.
You tried to kill Guinevere.
For your own good.
How can a serving girl understand what it means to be Queen?
Guinevere is wise, and strong, and I trust her more than anyone.
And that is your weakness.
You put too much trust in other people.
You, and you alone must rule Camelot.
I would rather not rule at all, than rule alone.
Your whole life, I tried to prepare you for the day you would become King.
Did you learn nothing?
I watched you rule, and I learnt that if you trust no-one, you will always live in fear.
Your hatred came from fear, not strength.
How dare you!
I loved, and respected you.
But I have to rule the Kingdom in my own way.
I have to do what I believe to be right.
I will not allow you destroy all that I built.
Then you will have to kill me.
I am not you, Father.
I can't rule the way you did.
Camelot must come before all else.
Even you.

Get away from him, Uther!
You've caused enough harm.
You don't belong here.
You must return to the other world.
This is MY kingdom!
You think you can drive me from it?
You are nothing but a serving boy!
I am much more than that.
You have magic?
I was born with it.
I made you Arthur's servant.
You are a sorcerer?
Even while you were King, there was magic at the heart of Camelot.
I will not allow you and your kind to poison my Kingdom.

I admired and respected him more than anyone.
I have to accept that I can't please him, and be true to myself.
Uther did what he thought he had to do to protect the Kingdom.
That doesn't mean he was right.
I want to build a kingdom that is fair and just.
One where everyone is respected, regardless of rank.
Does that include me?
Of course.
So, does that mean you're not going to hit me anymore?
When do I ever hit you?
All the time.
That's not hitting, Merlin.
That's merely friendly slaps.
It's horseplay.
So, can I give you a friendly slap?
You can certainly try.
What the hell was that?
It was, um... horseplay.
No, Merlin, you're doing it all wrong.
Why don't I show you?

Nothing...
Thinking.
You, thinking?
Well, now I'm really getting worried.
Shut up.
Leave it!
Why?
Because I'm telling you to and I'm the King of Camelot, not that that seems to mean anything to you.
Ready the horses and gather some supplies.
Where are we going?
You don't need to know.
Do not breathe a word of this to anyone.
Not even Guinevere.
You're threatening me with a spoon?
Ow!
I'm getting a very bad feeling about this place.
That is because you're a coward.
No.
It's because I value my life and I don't want to die horribly.
Fair point.
So, are we going to turn back?
No.
What are they?
The Great Stones of Nemeton.
You're going to use it?
This will be the only chance I have to see my father again.
I can't let it pass.
This is powerful magic.
My father was taken from me before his time.
Now there isn't a day that passes when I don't think of the things I wish I'd said to him.
If you were given the same chance to see your father, talk to him.
Wouldn't you do the same?
Father.
Arthur.
I thought I would never see you again.
There isn't a day that passes when I don't think of you.
And I, you.
There are times when I feel so alone,
I wish more than anything that you were by my side.
If I were at your side,
I fear you would not like all that I have to say.
What do you mean?
Many of the decisions you have made since you have become King go against all that I taught you.
I have done what I have believed to be right.
You have ignored our tradition, our ancient laws.
You have allowed common men to become knights.
They are some of the finest knights that Camelot's ever known.
They would gladly give their lives for the kingdom.
They question your decisions.
They make you look weak.
Listening to others is a sign of strength, not weakness.
How do you expect anyone to fear a King who does not know his own mind?
I don't want my people to respect me because they fear me.
Then they will not respect you at all.
Your marriage should have served to form an alliance with another kingdom and you choose to marry a serving girl.
I married for love.
I love Guinevere.
More than...
I can express.
There are some things that are more important than love.
It is your duty to strengthen and protect the kingdom.
You have failed.
I have always strived to make you proud.
How can I be proud of a son who ignores everything that I taught him?
Who is destroying my legacy?
I have brought peace to the kingdom...
At what price?
The peace cannot last.
If you are not strong, the kingdom will fall.
You must go now.
I need more time.
There is still so much I wish to say.
If you stay, you will be forever trapped in the world of the dead.
You must go now.
Go.
This can't be the last time I will ever see you.
Think about everything that I have said to you.
It isn't too late.
Now go.
I will always love you, Arthur.
Arthur?
Do you want to talk about it?
What happened at the stones?
It seems my father doesn't approve of the way
I have chosen to rule his kingdom.
You mean YOUR kingdom.
The things he said about the knights, about marrying Guinevere.
What if he's right?
What if I have weakened Camelot?
Do you really believe that?
You have always done what you believed to be right.
People respect you.
Thank you, Merlin.
Some people still think you're a foolish, arrogant ass.
Who?
Very funny.
We should get some sleep.
We covered the area from Pawlett down to Meldreth.
This includes 30 troops at Bawtry.
15 at Talan.
Ten at Chime.
Nine at Brune.
11 at Burwelle...
I want the table repaired before the next council meeting.
Are you listening to me, Merlin?
What?
Sorry.
I was just thinking about what happened.
Did you get a terrible fright?
Yes.
My heart nearly jumped out through my mouth.
Oh, well maybe you should have the rest of the day off and put your feet up?
Really?
You were joking?
There really is no limit to your intelligence, is there, Merlin?
Merlin?
Why does it always take you twice as long to change out of your armour?
Because I'm twice the size of you, little man.
Then why is it that your brain is so small?
Hello?
Is someone there?
Show yourself.
The axe must have fallen off the rack.
I'm surprised that a falling axe would cause such a deep wound.
Not as surprised as I was.
Quite.
You were lucky you weren't more severely injured.
It's strange...
What's that?
Just before it happened.
I sensed something, like there was someone there, watching me.
I'm sure it was just my mind playing tricks on me.
Apply a second poultice in the morning.
And no training.
Thank you, Gaius.
Is there something wrong, Merlin?
Merlin, I get the distinct impression there is something you're not telling me.
No.
Why would you say that?
Because there usually is.
We went to the Stones of Nemeton.
Merlin, I warned you of the dangers...
I tried to stop him.
He was insistent.
What is it, Merlin?
After the candelabra fell,
I was in the corridor outside the Council Chambers.
I could sense something.
It was like Percival said, a presence of some kind.
In the days of the Old Religion, the priestesses trained for years before entering into the spirit world.
It was fraught with dangers.
There was one thing they were schooled never to do.
As the veil closed, they were never to look back at the spirit.
What happened if they did?
They'd release the spirit into this world.
Arthur must have looked back.
What?
At the Stones of Nemeton, I think that you may have released your father's spirit.
And what makes you think that?
Did you look back?
As the veil closed, did you look back at your father?
I may have glanced round for a second.
In that second, you unleashed Uther's spirit.
All these strange things that have been happening?
The candelabra falling onto the Round Table.
Yes, because the chain broke.
The axe falling on Percival.
It was an accident.
Was it?
Do you really expect me to believe that my father's spirit is responsible for these things?
The Round Table represents everything that's changed since you became King.
You told me how Uther disapproved.
He's angry with you and that makes him dangerous.
I know my father.
He wouldn't do these things.
I think he'd do anything to protect his legacy.
Who knows what he's capable of?
Enough!
That's enough.
Leave me.
Go!
Is someone there?
Gwen!
Gwen!
You know this was Uther.
We don't know what happened.
So Gwen just mysteriously ended up locked in the kitchens, which just mysteriously caught fire.
You said yourself Uther disapproved of you marrying Gwen.
He wouldn't do this.
I know how hard this is for you.
Gaius, how is she?
Smoke has entered her lungs, but with time she will heal.
I have given her a sleeping draft.
She was lucky to escape with her life.
I've always known my father could be cruel, but why would he do this to Guinevere?
He knows how much I love her.
Gaius.
What do you know about ghosts?
We must force Uther's spirit to return to the other world before he does any more harm.
We must use The Horn of Cathbhadh to reopen the veil between the worlds.
But we must remember one thing... only the person who summoned the spirit can force it from this world.
Sorry.
You're fortunate I'm not easily frightened.
Really?
Because it looked like you jumped out of your skin.
That's because you're a clumsy oaf.
Now pick that lot up.
Where is Gaius?
How long does it take to make a potion?
These things take time if they're to be done properly.
What is it?
I heard something behind the door.
You're imagining things, Merlin.
What do we do?
There's your ghost, Merlin.
The potion will allow you to see Uther in his spirit form.
Once you are in his presence, you must blow the horn.
It is the only way you can force him to go back to the spirit world.
Is it safe?
I can't say I'm entirely sure.
What are you waiting for?
To see if it's safe.
So, if I don't die, you'll take yours?
Precisely.
Get on with it.
Well, at least we know it doesn't kill you instantly.
Eurgh!
That...
That is the foulest thing I've ever tasted.
Sorry.
Did I forget to tell you about that part?
There!
Where?
Oh, it's just our shadows.
Ow!
Arthur.
Merlin.
Leon.
Leon.
Is everything all right, my Lord?
It's perfectly fine.
We are...
Merlin.
Tell Leon what we're doing.
We're...
I'm teaching him some poetry.
Poetry?
I...
love poetry.
I was as surprised as you are.
He can't get enough of it.
I'll leave you to your poetry, then, my Lord.
Poetry?
That's the best you could come up with?
What did you want me to say?
I don't know.
Something that didn't make me sound like a lovestruck girl.
What was that?
It was my father.
I never thought the day would come when I would be hunting my own father.
When I became King, more than anything, I wanted to make him proud.
What is it?
You've always done what you believed to be right even if you knew your father would disapprove of it.
Do you not see how different you are to him?
Camelot is a better place since you became King.
My father clearly doesn't think so.
The people believe in you, Arthur.
It counts for nothing if you don't believe in yourself.
Check the storeroom.
Arthur!
Merlin?
Merlin, is that you?
Father?
I know it's you, Father.
Why are you doing this?
I did not spend my entire life building this kingdom to see my own son destroy it.
You tried to kill Guinevere.
For your own good.
How can a serving girl understand what it means to be Queen?
Guinevere is wise, and strong, and I trust her more than anyone.
And that is your weakness.
You put too much trust in other people.
You, and you alone must rule Camelot.
I would rather not rule at all, than rule alone.
Your whole life, I tried to prepare you for the day you would become King.
Did you learn nothing?
I watched you rule, and I learnt that if you trust no-one, you will always live in fear.
Your hatred came from fear, not strength.
How dare you!
I loved, and respected you.
But I have to rule the Kingdom in my own way.
I have to do what I believe to be right.
I will not allow you destroy all that I built.
Then you will have to kill me.
I am not you, Father.
I can't rule the way you did.
Camelot must come before all else.
Even you.
Get away from him, Uther!
You've caused enough harm.
You don't belong here.
You must return to the other world.
This is MY kingdom!
You think you can drive me from it?
You are nothing but a serving boy!
I am much more than that.
You have magic?
I was born with it.
I made you Arthur's servant.
You are a sorcerer?
Even while you were King, there was magic at the heart of Camelot.
I will not allow you and your kind to poison my Kingdom.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
About so much.
Arthur is a better, and more worthy King than you ever were.
No!
Bael onbryne!
It will give me great pleasure killing you.
Father!
Arthur!
No!
Please.
Whatever I have done, I have done for Camelot.
You've had your turn.
Now it's mine.
Merlin has...
I always looked up to my father.
I admired and respected him more than anyone.
I have to accept that I can't please him, and be true to myself.
Uther did what he thought he had to do to protect the Kingdom.
That doesn't mean he was right.
I want to build a kingdom that is fair and just.
One where everyone is respected, regardless of rank.
Does that include me?
Of course.
So, does that mean you're not going to hit me anymore?
When do I ever hit you?
All the time.
That's not hitting, Merlin.
That's merely friendly slaps.
It's horseplay.
So, can I give you a friendly slap?
You can certainly try.
What the hell was that?
It was, um... horseplay.
No, Merlin, you're doing it all wrong.
Why don't I show you?
Princess Mthian...
I have no-one else to turn to but you, Arthur.
You kill me and you'll have all of Camelot to answer to.
In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young man.
His name...
Merlin.
You're still angry with me, aren't you?
We spend the entire day hunting, catch nothing, because every time we got anywhere near anything you sneezed and frightened it away.
- Not the last time.
- No.
That time you fell into a stream.
No-one could accuse you of being predictable, Merlin.
- I think I'm getting a cold.
- Let's hope it's a bad one.
What was that?
I think it was a bird.
That?
That was definitely a woman screaming.
Why couldn't it have just been a bird?
It's never just a bird.
What are you doing?
I assume you want to risk our lives and see what's going on.
I never thought I'd say this, Merlin, but you're learning.
Let the woman go.
This woman has been sentenced to death.
It does not concern you.
I am Arthur Pendragon, King of Camelot, and your village is in my lands.
Her sorcery has brought sickness and suffering to this village.
Did she receive a fair trial?
Your father would have shown her no mercy.
I am not my father.
Now cut her down.
I will not endanger the lives of all who live here.
I said... cut her down.
Is there anything more you can do for her?
She won't make it through the night.
Make her as comfortable as possible.
Thank you.
You should try and get some rest.
My time has come.
When you have lived as long as I, you no longer fear the journey to the next world.
I have a gift for you.
You showed kindness, and compassion.
Those are the qualities of a true king.
Open it.
It's beautiful.
It has the power to summon the spirits of the dead.
The Horn of Cathbhadh.
When Uther attacked the Isle of the Blessed, the Horn of Cathbhadh was smuggled to safety before the temple fell.
It hasn't been heard of since.
The old woman said it could be used to open the door to the spirit world?
I have seen it with my own eyes.
Long before the time of the Great Purge I took part in such ceremonies.
Each year at Beltain, the High Priestesses would gather at the Great Stones of Nemeton
and summon the spirits of their ancestors.
It holds powerful magic.
You must keep it safe.
He's always like this at the anniversary of his coronation.
I thought it was a cause for celebration?
It is, but it's also the anniversary of Uther's death.
What are you doing?
Nothing...
Thinking.
You, thinking?
- Well, now I'm really getting worried.
- Shut up.
Leave it!
- Why?
- Because I'm telling you to and I'm the King of Camelot, not that that seems to mean anything to you.
Ready the horses and gather some supplies.
Where are we going?
You don't need to know.
Do not breathe a word of this to anyone.
Not even Guinevere.
You're threatening me with a spoon?
Ow!
I'm getting a very bad feeling about this place.
That is because you're a coward.
No.
It's because I value my life and I don't want to die horribly.
Fair point.
- So, are we going to turn back?
- No.
What are they?
The Great Stones of Nemeton.
You're going to use it?
This will be the only chance I have to see my father again.
I can't let it pass.
This is powerful magic.
My father was taken from me before his time.
Now there isn't a day that passes when I don't think of the things I wish I'd said to him.
If you were given the same chance...
to see your father... talk to him.
Wouldn't you do the same?
Father.
Arthur.
I thought I would never see you again.
There isn't a day that passes when I don't think of you.
And I, you.
There are times when I feel so alone,
I wish more than anything that you were by my side.
If I were at your side,
I fear you would not like all that I have to say.

Did she receive a fair trial?
Your father would have shown her no mercy.
I am not my father.
Now cut her down.
I will not endanger the lives of all who live here.
I said cut her down.
Is there anything more you can do for her?
She won't make it through the night.
Make her as comfortable as possible.
Thank you.
You should try and get some rest.
My time has come.
When you have lived as long as I, you no longer fear the journey to the next world.
I have a gift for you.
You showed kindness, and compassion.
Those are the qualities of a true king.
Open it.
It's beautiful.
It has the power to summon the spirits of the dead.
The Horn of Cathbhadh.
When Uther attacked the Isle of the Blessed, the Horn of Cathbhadh was smuggled to safety before the temple fell.
It hasn't been heard of since.
The old woman said it could be used to open the door to the spirit world?
I have seen it with my own eyes.
Long before the time of the Great Purge I took part in such ceremonies.
Each year at Beltain, the High Priestesses would gather at the Great Stones of Nemeton
and summon the spirits of their ancestors.
It holds powerful magic.
You must keep it safe.
He's always like this at the anniversary of his coronation.
I thought it was a cause for celebration?
It is, but it's also the anniversary of Uther's death.
What are you doing?
Nothing...
Thinking.
You, thinking?
Well, now I'm really getting worried.
Shut up.
Leave it!
Why?
Because I'm telling you to and I'm the King of Camelot, not that that seems to mean anything to you.
Ready the horses and gather some supplies.
Where are we going?
You don't need to know.
Do not breathe a word of this to anyone.
Not even Guinevere.
You're threatening me with a spoon?
I'm getting a very bad feeling about this place.
That is because you're a coward.
No.
It's because I value my life and I don't want to die horribly.
Fair point.
So, are we going to turn back?
No.
What are they?
The Great Stones of Nemeton.
You're going to use it?
This will be the only chance I have to see my father again.
I can't let it pass.
This is powerful magic.
My father was taken from me before his time.
Now there isn't a day that passes when I don't think of the things I wish I'd said to him.
If you were given the same chance to see your father, talk to him.
Wouldn't you do the same?
Father.
Arthur.
I thought I would never see you again.
There isn't a day that passes when I don't think of you.
And I, you.
There are times when I feel so alone,
I wish more than anything that you were by my side.
If I were at your side,
I fear you would not like all that I have to say.
What do you mean?
Many of the decisions you have made since you have become King go against all that I taught you.
I have done what I have believed to be right.
You have ignored our tradition, our ancient laws.
You have allowed common men to become knights.
They are some of the finest knights that Camelot's ever known.
They would gladly give their lives for the kingdom.
They question your decisions.
They make you look weak.
Listening to others is a sign of strength, not weakness.
How do you expect anyone to fear a King who does not know his own mind?
I don't want my people to respect me because they fear me.
Then they will not respect you at all.
Your marriage should have served to form an alliance with another kingdom and you choose to marry a serving girl.
I married for love.
I love Guinevere.
More than...
I can express.
There are some things that are more important than love.
It is your duty to strengthen and protect the kingdom.
You have failed.
I have always strived to make you proud.
How can I be proud of a son who ignores everything that I taught him?
Who is destroying my legacy?
I have brought peace to the kingdom...
At what price?
The peace cannot last.
If you are not strong, the kingdom will fall.
You must go now.
I need more time.
There is still so much I wish to say.
If you stay, you will be forever trapped in the world of the dead.
You must go now.
Go.
This can't be the last time I will ever see you.
Think about everything that I have said to you.
It isn't too late.
Now go.
I will always love you, Arthur.
Arthur?
Do you want to talk about it?
What happened at the stones?
It seems my father doesn't approve of the way
I have chosen to rule his kingdom.
You mean YOUR kingdom.
The things he said about the knights, about marrying Guinevere.
What if he's right?
What if I have weakened Camelot?
Do you really believe that?
You have always done what you believed to be right.
People respect you.
Thank you, Merlin.
Some people still think you're a foolish, arrogant ass.
Who?
Very funny.
We should get some sleep.
We covered the area from Pawlett down to Meldreth.
This includes 30 troops at Bawtry.
15 at Talan.
Ten at Chime.
Nine at Brune.
11 at Burwelle...
I want the table repaired before the next council meeting.
Are you listening to me, Merlin?
What?
Sorry.
I was just thinking about what happened.
Did you get a terrible fright?
Yes.
My heart nearly jumped out through my mouth.
Oh, well maybe you should have the rest of the day off and put your feet up?
Really?
You were joking?
There really is no limit to your intelligence, is there, Merlin?
Merlin?
Why does it always take you twice as long to change out of your armour?
Because I'm twice the size of you, little man.
Then why is it that your brain is so small?
Hello?
Is someone there?
Show yourself.
The axe must have fallen off the rack.
I'm surprised that a falling axe would cause such a deep wound.
Not as surprised as I was.
Quite.
You were lucky you weren't more severely injured.
It's strange...
What's that?
Just before it happened.
I sensed something, like there was someone there, watching me.
I'm sure it was just my mind playing tricks on me.
Apply a second poultice in the morning.
And no training.
Thank you, Gaius.
Is there something wrong, Merlin?
Merlin, I get the distinct impression there is something you're not telling me.
No.
Why would you say that?
Because there usually is.
We went to the Stones of Nemeton.
Merlin, I warned you of the dangers...
I tried to stop him.
He was insistent.
What is it, Merlin?
After the candelabra fell,
I was in the corridor outside the Council Chambers.
I could sense something.
It was like Percival said,a presence of some kind.
In the days of the Old Religion, the priestesses trained for years before entering into the spirit world.
It was fraught with dangers.
There was one thing they were schooled never to do.
As the veil closed, they were never to look back at the spirit.
What happened if they did?
They'd release the spirit into this world.
Arthur must have looked back.
What?
At the Stones of Nemeton, I think that you may have released your father's spirit.
And what makes you think that?
Did you look back?
As the veil closed, did you look back at your father?
I may have glanced round for a second.
In that second, you unleashed Uther's spirit.
All these strange things that have been happening?
The candelabra falling onto the Round Table.
Yes, because the chain broke.
The axe falling on Percival.
It was an accident.
Was it?
Do you really expect me to believe that my father's spirit is responsible for these things?
The Round Table represents everything that's changed since you became King.
You told me how Uther disapproved.
He's angry with you and that makes him dangerous.
I know my father.
He wouldn't do these things.
I think he'd do anything to protect his legacy.
Who knows what he's capable of?
Enough!
That's enough.
Leave me.
Go!
Is someone there?
Gwen!
Gwen!
You know this was Uther.
We don't know what happened.
So Gwen just mysteriously ended up locked in the kitchens, which just mysteriously caught fire.
You said yourself Uther disapproved of you marrying Gwen.
He wouldn't do this.
I know how hard this is for you.
Gaius, how is she?
Smoke has entered her lungs, but with time she will heal.
I have given her a sleeping draft.
She was lucky to escape with her life.
I've always known my father could be cruel, but why would he do this to Guinevere?
He knows how much I love her.
Gaius.
What do you know about ghosts?
We must force Uther's spirit to return to the other world before he does any more harm.
We must use The Horn of Cathbhadh to reopen the veil between the worlds.
But we must remember one thing - only the person who summoned the spirit can force it from this world.
Sorry.
You're fortunate I'm not easily frightened.
Really?
Because it looked like you jumped out of your skin.
That's because you're a clumsy oaf.
Now pick that lot up.
Where is Gaius?
How long does it take to make a potion?
These things take time if they're to be done properly.
What is it?
I heard something behind the door.
You're imagining things, Merlin.
What do we do?
There's your ghost, Merlin.
The potion will allow you to see Uther in his spirit form.
Once you are in his presence, you must blow the horn.
It is the only way you can force him to go back to the spirit world.
Is it safe?
I can't say I'm entirely sure.
What are you waiting for?
To see if it's safe.
So, if I don't die, you'll take yours?
Precisely.
Get on with it.
Well, at least we know it doesn't kill you instantly.
That...
That is the foulest thing I've ever tasted.
Sorry.
Did I forget to tell you about that part?
There!
Where?
Oh, it's just our shadows.
Arthur.
Merlin.
Leon.
Leon.
Is everything all right, my Lord?
It's perfectly fine.
We are...
Merlin.
Tell Leon what we're doing.
We're...
I'm teaching him some poetry.
Poetry?
I...
love poetry.
I was as surprised as you are.
He can't get enough of it.
I'll leave you to your poetry, then, my Lord.
Poetry?
That's the best you could come up with?
What did you want me to say?
I don't know.
Something that didn't make me sound like a lovestruck girl.
What was that?
It was my father.
I never thought the day would come when I would be hunting my own father.
When I became King, more than anything, I wanted to make him proud.
What is it?
You've always done what you believed to be right even if you knew your father would disapprove of it.
Do you not see how different you are to him?
Camelot is a better place since you became King.
My father clearly doesn't think so.
The people believe in you, Arthur.
It counts for nothing if you don't believe in yourself.
Check the storeroom.
Arthur!
Merlin?
Merlin, is that you?
Father?
I know it's you, Father.
Why are you doing this?
I did not spend my entire life building this kingdom to see my own son destroy it.
You tried to kill Guinevere.
For your own good.
How can a serving girl understand what it means to be Queen?
Guinevere is wise, and strong, and I trust her more than anyone.
And that is your weakness.
You put too much trust in other people.
You, and you alone must rule Camelot.
I would rather not rule at all, than rule alone.
Your whole life, I tried to prepare you for the day you would become King.
Did you learn nothing?
I watched you rule, and I learnt that if you trust no-one, you will always live in fear.
Your hatred came from fear, not strength.
How dare you!
I loved, and respected you.
But I have to rule the Kingdom in my own way.
I have to do what I believe to be right.
I will not allow you destroy all that I built.
Then you will have to kill me.
I am not you, Father.
I can't rule the way you did.
Camelot must come before all else.
Even you.
Get away from him, Uther!
You've caused enough harm.
You don't belong here.
You must return to the other world.
This is MY kingdom!
You think you can drive me from it?
You are nothing but a serving boy!
I am much more than that.
You have magic?
I was born with it.
I made you Arthur's servant.
You are a sorcerer?
Even while you were King, there was magic at the heart of Camelot.
I will not allow you and your kind to poison my Kingdom.
You're wrong.
You're wrong.
About so much.
Arthur is a better, and more worthy King than you ever were.
No!
Bael onbryne!
It will give me great pleasure killing you.
Father!
Arthur!
No!
Please.
Whatever I have done, I have done for Camelot.
You've had your turn.
Now it's mine.
Merlin has...
I always looked up to my father.
I admired and respected him more than anyone.
I have to accept that I can't please him, and be true to myself.
Uther did what he thought he had to do to protect the Kingdom.
That doesn't mean he was right.
I want to build a kingdom that is fair and just.
One where everyone is respected, regardless of rank.
Does that include me?
Of course.
So, does that mean you're not going to hit me anymore?
When do I ever hit you?
All the time.
That's not hitting, Merlin.
That's merely friendly slaps.
It's horseplay.
So, can I give you a friendly slap?
You can certainly try.
What the hell was that?
It was, um... ..horseplay.
No, Merlin, you're doing it all wrong.
Why don't I show you?
Princess Mthian...
I have no-one else to turn to but you, Arthur.
You kill me and you'll have all of Camelot to answer to.
In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young man.
His name
- Merlin.
You're still angry with me, aren't you?
We spend the entire day hunting, catch nothing, because every time we got anywhere near anything you sneezed and frightened it away.
Not the last time.
No.
That time you fell into a stream.
No-one could accuse you of being predictable, Merlin.
I think I'm getting a cold.
Let's hope it's a bad one.
What was that?
I think it was a bird.
That?
That was definitely a woman screaming.
Why couldn't it have just been a bird?
It's never just a bird.
What are you doing?
I assume you want to risk our lives and see what's going on.
I never thought I'd say this, Merlin, but you're learning.
Let the woman go.
This woman has been sentenced to death.
It does not concern you.
I am Arthur Pendragon, King of Camelot, and your village is in my lands.
Her sorcery has brought sickness and suffering to this village.
Did she receive a fair trial?
Your father would have shown her no mercy.
I am not my father.
Now cut her down.
I will not endanger the lives of all who live here.
I said... cut her down.

I have no-one else to turn to but you, Arthur.
You kill me and you'll have all of Camelot to answer to.
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, I see.
Now, you're asking to get lit up.
Somebody wants to get lit up.

Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you scold me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Complainant would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
- Not in Tootsie.
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm--
People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No.
Defense rests.
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, I see.
Now, you're asking to get lit up.

Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you scold me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Complainant would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
- Not in Tootsie.
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm--
People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No.
Defense rests.
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, I see.
Now, you're asking to get lit up.
Somebody wants to get lit up.

Messages, color coded by urgency.
Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you schooled me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
The Plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
Not in Tootsie.
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm--
People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No.
Defense rests.
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
== sync, corrected by elderman == - resync by majork -
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, I see.
Now, you're asking to get lit up.
Somebody wants to get lit up.

Messages, color coded by urgency.
Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you schooled me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
The Plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
Not in Tootsie.
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm--
People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
== sync, corrected by elderman == - resync by majork -
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
[Laughs] Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
[Clicks tongue] You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
[Blow thuds] [Groans]
[People murmuring]
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
[Blows]
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
[Giggling]
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, I see.
Now, you're asking to get lit up.

Messages, color coded by urgency.
Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
[Chuckles] Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
[Telephone ringing] Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
[Sighs]
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
[Exhales] I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
[Distant siren wailing]
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
[Snaps fingers]
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
[Silently]
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
[Laughs]
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
[Clicks tongue]
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- [Clears throat]
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you scold me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Complainant would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
- Not in Tootsie.
- [Laughs]
[Laughs]
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
[Chuckles]
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm-- [chuckles] People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
[Scoffs] Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No.
Defense rests.
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
[Sighs] With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
[Laughs] It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
[Laughs]
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
[Scoffs]
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
[Laughs] Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
[Clicks tongue] You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
[Blow thuds] [Groans]
[People murmuring]
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
[Blows]
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
[Giggling]
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, I see.
Now, you're asking to get lit up.
Somebody wants to get lit up.

Messages, color coded by urgency.
Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
[Chuckles] Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
[Telephone ringing] Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
[Sighs]
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
[Exhales] I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
[Distant siren wailing]
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
[Snaps fingers]
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
[Silently]
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
[Laughs]
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
[Clicks tongue]
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- [Clears throat]
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you schooled me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
The Plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
- Not in Tootsie.
- [Laughs]
[Laughs]
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
[Chuckles]
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm-- [chuckles] People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
[Scoffs] Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No.
Defense rests.
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
[Sighs] With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
[Laughs] It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
[Laughs]
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
[Scoffs]
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
== sync, corrected by elderman == - resync by majork -
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
[Laughs] Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
[Clicks tongue] You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
[Blow thuds] [Groans]
[People murmuring]
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
[Blows]
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
[Giggling]
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.

Messages, color coded by urgency.
Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
[Chuckles] Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
[Telephone ringing] Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
[Sighs]
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
[Exhales] I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
[Distant siren wailing]
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
[Snaps fingers]
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
[Silently]
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
[Laughs]
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
[Clicks tongue]
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- [Clears throat]
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you schooled me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
The Plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
- Not in Tootsie.
- [Laughs]
[Laughs]
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
[Chuckles]
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm-- [chuckles] People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
[Scoffs] Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
[Sighs] With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
[Laughs] It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
[Laughs]
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
[Scoffs]
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
== sync, corrected by elderman == - resync by majork -
TANNER:
So, you did have the document from Coastal Motors.
Objection.
JESSICA:
Harvey.
You're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud?
What?
You just said you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files, found the report...
Whoops, that's it.
Whoops. (LAUGHING) I hope you got that.
Whoops?
Your defense is whoops?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was five million and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about a hundred million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal, anyway.
You know, I see why Hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from five million to a hundred million and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's the sticking point, I might be able to go to zero million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is, he gets disbarred.
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.
I mean, what, does he cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, because he cures more than he makes.
Like when you stuck your nose into my case last year and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then, he took his ball and went home.
Should have stayed there.
Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're, uh, throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I want to take my ball and shove it up your...
Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair.
Your pretty nails.
See, she's the man and you're the girl.
You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like...
This deposition is over.
Oh, what, is Mommy going to take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You've got a thing for Mommy.
And now, it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with Daddy, Mommy was out banging...
Point Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So, when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
It won't.
Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all, but...
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
But she's Managing Partner.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know that you didn't do it, how is a jury going to feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right.
What?
If we're going to do this, I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up.
But that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch them in the face.
(LAUGHING)
You want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
Um, I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Could you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one.
In spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay, I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait.
Harvey, stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan.
Junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me.
Because there is nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, see, now, you're asking to get Litt up.
Somebody wants to get Litt up.
See the money, wanna stay for your meal
Get another piece of pie for your wife
Everybody wanna know how it feel
Everybody wanna see what it's like
I'll even eat a bean pie I don't mind
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money
All right!
All step back I'm 'bout to dance
The greenback boogie
Your messages, color-coded by urgency.
Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then, those would all be the same shade of "l-don't-give-a-shit."
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
How was what?
Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
(LAUGHING) Okay.
Mock trial, trial run, potato, po-taht-oh...
Not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay.
What round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor?
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that.
He thinks I'm pretty.
Wait, what judge?
His Honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No.
No, he can't.
He can.
I'm not.
You are.
Harvey!
Listen,
Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Well, you mess with the bull, you get the horns.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica is going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
And Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
Well, first of all, I'd...
Don't tell me.
Tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
ZOE:
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
Rule number 27.
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's on board.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could have told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't awkward.
You know, because...
I didn't call you back five years ago?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm going to come in.
But I want to know.
Why did you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then, they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case.
And they are undisputed.
(SIGHS)
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
I...
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah, just quoting A Few Good Men.
For work. (WHISPERING) I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you...
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
No, I don't.
How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean...
You don't think he has integrity.
Uh, sorry.
Um, I have to go.
Oh, uh, um, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
LOUIS:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course.
It's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used it against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So, then, use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to, uh, bug his office with a Dictaphone and use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did.
Because you are a devious son of a bitch.
How dare you...
Shut up.
You know it, I know it, everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then, why didn't you take it to the Managing Partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him.
But you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked.
I told him.
Oh, so, he asked if Harvey had a secret.
No, he didn't.
But that...
So, then, you volunteered it, which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you going to ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voicemails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant, I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
I did.
Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh.
And when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted, too?
Donna?
I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm going to be taking the fifth.
So, if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say,
"I decline to answer," because that's all you're going to get out of me, anyway.
Donna.
I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
ZOE:
You don't get my kind of track record just by "Moneyballing" people.
HARVEY:
She's the me ofjury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind ofjury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
BOTH:
Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
HARVEY:
Look, the partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you and it ever goes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
LOUIS:
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that, as an associate, you hid an important file belonging to a...
Ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah.
A Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
That was a one-time thing.
So, you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
No.
Why not?
What was done was done.
What was done was done.
LOUIS:
And like you said, it was a one-time thing.
Right?
Yes.
Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
LOUIS:
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
Your Honor...
This time, a man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
(LAUGHS)
MIKE:
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen.
Did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So, you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
Objection.
You can't object.
Jessica will.
Could you just...
Sorry, yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then, let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is going to be bad.
Isn't it?
MIKE:
Donna's going to be great.
Just follow the script.
No, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
Did you see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
What's this?
A subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing "tip-toe through the tulips"
around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them, too.
You yourself said, "Go after the man."
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something.
And I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now, it is.
Good.
What?
MIKE:
Whoa.
Whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
Yes.
Nope.
You are under oath.
And, and I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will.
Or I'll know.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
(SCOFFS) Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
Where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
Nothing.
(CLEARS THROAT)
You're lying.
No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then, answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard Law.
Now, it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there.
And I don't know anything that's going to help this case.
You want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
What?
I didn't even ask a question, yet.
Yeah, well, you were going to.
Yeah, and you were going to say no.
But instead, you're going to say yes.
(SIGHS) That's funny, because I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Not Harvey, no.
I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document.
And you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
You know that I...
Broke your promise.
Well, then, I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
You hired an attorney?
Yeah, I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once and you schooled me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's going to lose in court, he is going to get disbarred, and he is never going to be able to do what he loves ever again.
That is not fair.
No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what?
Do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take Pilates.
I don't give a shit, because whatever you do, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.
The plaintiff would like to call Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar.
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's going to make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I am acting in an unbiased manner.
Sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest Senior Partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid-eight figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those eight figures, would he have still made Senior Partner so young?
No.
Mmm.
JESSICA:
No, he wouldn't have.
How much has Mr. Specter personally gained as Senior Partner?
Well, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus, yet.
Ballpark.
No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then, answer the question.
Millions.
And a Junior Partner makes?
Much less.
So, win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to almost always win.
SERVER:
Let me clear that for you.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine.
Almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny because you were talking about me.
There it is.
The Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson.
Are you trying to seduce me?
(LAUGHING) Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to "second of all," I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
Not in Tootsie.
(LAUGHING)
Are you afraid you're going to lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes, I drive.
Fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that makes the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
But if they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you'd do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess.
You didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So, I had no way of knowing it was the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not going to believe you, either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Look, Harvey.
When you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever going to protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ah.
Ms. Paulsen.
Did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
LOUIS:
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
I decline to answer.
How...
I'm not going to ask questions that you're just going to plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing.
Which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him.
And I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with...
It has everything to do with.
LOUIS:
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
(BREATHES DEEPLY)
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
Yes.
Who did you choose?
(SIGHS) Harvey.
Because you love him.
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him?
Yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection.
Badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
JESSICA:
Your Honor.
Please.
I just need a...
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough.
You crossed a line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing, and for what?
For fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
You are not Travis Tanner.
I don't...
You did not have to do that.
I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly?
Huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you.
Because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there, that's on you!
Not me!
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo.
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was going to do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart?
Maybe you are.
(LAUGHS) And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did.
To help Harvey.
That's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me.
Because in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait.
You trusted Louis.
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry, but I'm... (LAUGHING)
People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this.
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means Harvey getting disbarred.
DANIEL:
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred, anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're going to do something about it?
Tanner's cases.
Transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is.
And I'm going to find it.
Because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
I do.
Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No, you can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
(LAUGHS) I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now, we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me.
The partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
(LAUGHS) Yes, but they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So, what do we do?
JESSICA:
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mailroom of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No.
You did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that you were the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with.
You care about the people you work for.
And you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
No.
Afraid.
No.
JESSICA:
Then why?
Just let it go.
No, you are under oath.
Then, hold me in contempt.
For God's sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
JESSICA:
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Uh.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
That whole thing your idea?
I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me?
You did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes.
It was my idea.
Harvey, the partners loved what they saw in there.
You're going to win.
LOUIS:
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
He's not better than me.
I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
Shortcomings?
Mmm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
Yes.
Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be Senior Partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
Yes.
And as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No.
Defense rests.
Refusing to admit defeat, even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
Yeah, I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said.
Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis' testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury?
They didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence.
They saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never going to happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the Managing Partner?
(SIGHS) With all due respect, it's not going to matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're going to need it.
What does it matter what I have?
You're just going to sucker punch me again, anyway.
Boo hoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you can stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
This gets me off the hook.
Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time, have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted.
So, stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
What the hell did you do?
This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm a hundred thousand dollars.
Including me.
You share the profits, you share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
I found dirt on Tanner.
What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said what dirt?
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let the partners put this to a vote.
HARVEY:
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
(LAUGHS) It worked?
So, it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
(LAUGHS) You're welcome.
HARVEY:
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to.
Because we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner...
Everybody is paying now.
You have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us.
You, me, Jessica, Louis.
Everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
What I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's going to cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then
I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision, so by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now, all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a hold-out.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show, we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question Jessica's judgment and by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a Partners' meeting, at which point we will vote.
Either Jessica will retain her position as Managing Partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.
So you did have the document from Coastal Motors?
- Objection.
- Harvey, you're the defendant.
I wasn't objecting to his question.
Just his tie.
I do have to look at it, you know.
This is fun, isn't it, Harv?
Hanging out, catching up, learning about your fraud.
I hate to burst your bubble, Trav, but there was no fraud.
There was no fraud.
What?
You just said, you had the document.
Yes.
We went back through the case files.
Found the report.
Whoops.
That's it.
"Whoops"?
[Laughs] Hope, you got that.
"Whoops"?
Your defense is "whoops"?
All right, you've made your point.
You made us a settlement offer that we would never take.
Let's talk about one that we would.
This is a deposition, not a settlement meeting.
Every meeting is a settlement meeting.
Fine.
The offer was 5 million, and Harvey gets disbarred.
How about $100 million?
And Harvey gets disbarred.
Tanner, you want to take this to court, go right ahead.
I'd rather watch her cut you down than see her cut a deal anyway.
You know, I see why hairdo wants to roll the dice, but why you?
You just went from 5 million to 100 million, and you're questioning why I don't want to settle.
If that's a sticking point,
I might be able to go to 0 million.
But the one thing I won't budge on is he gets disbarred.
I think I'm doing you a favor.
And what does he-- cause a headache like this once, twice a month?
Doesn't matter, 'cause he cures more than he makes, like when you stuck your nose into my case last year, and he beat you.
Crushed him.
Then he took his ball and went home.
- Should've stayed there.
- Look at that.
Finishing each other's sentences.
How cute.
No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.
Good for you, Harvey.
I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.
Watch yourself, Tanner.
Oh, what's the matter, Harv?
Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?
You want to take your ball and go home?
I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
Of course.
Your coifed hair, your pretty nails.
See?
She's the man, and you're the girl.
[Clicks tongue] You know, it's funny.
I would have thought she'd prefer someone like--
This deposition is over.
Now what?
Is mommy gonna take you home now?
Wait.
That's it.
You got a thing for mommy.
And now it all makes sense.
Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--
[Blow thuds] [Groans]
[People murmuring]
Point, Tanner.
I'll see you in court, Harv.
So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?
He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.
[Blows]
That's funny.
But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.
- It won't.
- Not if you're prepared.
Are you suggesting a trial run?
I don't want a trial at all but--
We already know your position is to cut me loose.
Not you.
No.
I'm just one of many partners who don't know what to think.
And if they don't know you didn't do it, how is a jury gonna feel?
You're betting everything on this trial.
Better make damn sure you can win.
He's an asshole.
He's right.
All right, what?
If we're gonna do this,
I don't want to waste the chance to tune you up, but that means we need a damn good Tanner.
Are you saying I'm rusty?
When was the last time you were in the ring?
We don't need a good Tanner.
We need a nasty Tanner.
Someone who will do anything to beat me.
Someone who makes you want to punch him in the face.
[Giggling]
Oh, you want me to do what?
I just told you four times.
I want you to play Tanner.
No, no, no.
I'm--I was a little distracted because I was reading.
Can you just repeat it one more time?
Look, Louis, you've had your fun.
When I said the ground rules were to knock me off my game,
I was talking about the trial.
I know what you're talking about.
You didn't come to me because I'm an idiot.
No, not because you're one, in spite of you being one.
I'm the man for the job, and you know it.
Actually, I had you at number five on my list.
And what did Jessica have me at?
Six.
Okay.
I get it.
I get it.
You're trying to make me mad.
No, I'm trying to make you good.
You see, the one thing you have in common with Tanner is your hatred of me.
That is true.
But what you don't have are his skills.
But that's okay.
I'll go to somebody else.
Wait, Harvey.
Stop.
You don't think I can win?
I know you can't.
This isn't some bank loan, junior.
Get out.
I've got a trial to prepare for.
And you know what?
When you lose, do not come crying to me, because there's nothing on this earth that would be sacred enough to stop me from shoving your ass in the goddamn ground.
Good.
Because those are the real ground rules.
Oh, I see.
Now, you're asking to get lit up.
Somebody wants to get lit up.

Messages, color coded by urgency.
Has Donna called back?
She would be red, so...
No.
Then those would all be the same shade of I-don't-give-a-shit.
Call her again.
Yes.
So?
How was it?
- How was what?
- Punching Tanner.
It was awesome, wasn't it?
Tell me it was awesome.
What are you, in middle school?
I'm in the middle of a trial.
A mock trial.
Mock trials are for children.
The adults are doing an in-house trial run.
[Chuckles] Okay.
Mock trial, trial run.
Po-tay-to, po-tah-to, not potato.
What do you need me to do?
What he needs you to do is help me.
What's this?
You've been drafted.
Okay, what round?
Excuse me?
Sports metaphor.
Oh, it's not tennis.
Sports.
You've been assigned by the judge to help me in pretty boy's trial.
Oh, look at that, he thinks I'm pretty.
[Telephone ringing] Wait, what judge?
His honor, Daniel Hardman.
I'll see you in court, sweet tits.
No, no.
He can't.
- He can.
- I'm not--
- You are.
- Harvey--
Listen, Louis is devious, confident, and intelligent.
You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful.
Now is not the time to quote The Breakfast Club.
Oh, you mess with the bully, you get the horn.
Stop it.
This trial is no joke.
Jessica's going against Muhammad Ali.
She better be able to beat Joe Frazier.
Louis is no Joe Frazier.
Okay.
I get it.
You want me to help Louis think outside the box.
Exactly.
Now, how would you come after me?
- Well, first of all--
- Don't tell me, tell Louis.
Because you and I are not discussing this trial during this trial.
Oh, and you were right.
I know.
About what?
Tanner.
It was awesome.
Guess you're not going to let me win.
Have I ever?
Would I know?
Doubtful.
Have you ever?
I am right now.
Rule number 27:
Never beat the person you're trying to close.
I always hated rule number 27.
You couldn't close me five years ago.
What makes you think you've got a shot tonight?
Didn't.
Not couldn't.
And five years ago, it wasn't your legal services
I was interested in.
How does Jessica feel about an employee who resigned coming back to consult?
She's onboard.
Do you mean I have to convince her?
See that?
That's why I want you.
You could've told me all this on the phone.
Well, I wanted to see you first.
Make sure things weren't...
awkward.
You know, because--
"I didn't call you back five years ago"?
Oops.
You think you didn't call me back five years ago?
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.
Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
Because you know I'm right.
Because I'm a bigger person.
Which is why I'm gonna come in.
But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?
Why do you think?
They had the document.
They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
These are the facts of the case, and they are undisputed.
[Sighs]
Aren't you supposed to be over there?
You know, I'm just working on something for work.
Yeah.
And just quoting A Few Good Men.
- For work.
- I know.
Look, I, um...
I have to ask you.
Do you think that it's at all possible that he actually did it?
- No, I don't.
- How do you know?
Because I know Harvey.
I mean, how could you think he could do it?
Because I don't know Harvey.
All I know is that he thinks he's above the rules, and he will do whatever it takes to win.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean--
you don't think he has integrity.
Ah.
Sorry, I have to go.
Oh, Mike.
What happens to you if Harvey loses?
I don't know.
But right now, it's not my job to worry about him losing.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, guilty is not gray.
You either are or you aren't.
And Harvey Specter is guilty of concealing that document.
It's a good opening.
It's not good enough.
Says his lap dog.
Says the guy who knows how to beat him.
[Exhales] I'm listening.
How?
Don't play the odds.
Play the man.
Do you know how Harvey beat Tanner?
No.
He threatened to commit perjury to win.
Of course, it's classic Harvey.
He was bluffing.
But Tanner didn't know that, and Harvey used against him.
What's your point?
My point is you said classic Harvey before you even knew he was bluffing because you don't think Harvey has any integrity.
Nobody thinks Harvey has integrity.
So then use that against him.
Easier said than done.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
Maybe it would just be easier to bug his office with a dictaphone.
Then use that to get ahead.
I did not use it for that reason.
Yes, you did, because you are a devious son of a bitch.
- How dare you--
- Shut up.
You know it.
I know it.
Everybody knows it.
I did what I did for the integrity of the firm.
Then why didn't you take it to the managing partner of the firm?
Daniel had a right to know.
And Jessica had a right to tell him, but you told him.
You sought out Hardman because if he comes out on top, you want him to owe you.
He was there when I heard it.
He asked, I told him.
Oh, so he asked if Harvey had a secret?
- No, he didn't.
- So then you volunteered it.
Which is as good as seeking it out.
Devious.
You weren't there.
You don't know.
You're twisting what happened.
Which is exactly what you need to do to Harvey.
[Distant siren wailing]
How long have you been waiting?
How long were you gonna ignore my calls?
Last I checked, you haven't called.
I've left you ten voicemails in the last week.
Huh, that's so weird.
I seem to remember your assistant leaving me ten voice mails.
You know I don't know how to dial out.
Is it eight?
Is it nine?
Do you know how to use your cell phone?
Because if I were your assistant,
I would have totally programmed my phone number into it.
Oh, wait.
[Snaps fingers]
I did.
When I was your assistant.
Okay, look.
I'm an asshole.
Did you come here to tell me things I already know?
No, I came here to see how you're doing.
You came to get me to do the trial run.
Donna, it's important.
Yeah, important for me to get up there and say
I screwed up trying to protect you?
You did screw up.
Yes.
To protect you.
Which I never asked you to do.
No, you just expected me to do it.
Like I expected you to fight for me.
- I did.
- Really?
Like you fought for Mike?
Because that fight, you somehow managed to win.
Oh, and when you thought he needed to be fired, you respected him enough to do it yourself.
Jessica insisted that she be the one to let you go.
And since when have you ever done anything Jessica wanted if it wasn't what you wanted too?
Donna, I need you there.
I need you to tell them that I didn't do this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
I've hired an attorney.
If this thing goes to trial, I'm gonna be taking the fifth.
So if you need another Donna at the firm, just have anybody say, "I decline to answer,"
because that's all you're gonna get out of me anyway.
- Donna.
- I decline to answer.
Really?
Really?
You don't get my kind of track record just by moneyballing people.
She's the me of jury consulting.
Don't sell me short, Harvey.
I'm trying to close a deal here.
What kind of jury would you pick?
I already did.
You need men.
That's a mistake.
Women love me.
Really?
Because I showed them your photo, and they described you as arrogant, conceited, cocky...
Oh, and arrogant again.
What about handsome?
Did I not mention arrogant?
It's not bragging if it's true.
- Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is.
Zoe, I'm still not convinced
I should hire you instead of Ted Phillips.
After all, Harvey never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips.
Who says I never tried to sleep with Ted Phillips?
I can do what Ted can't.
Hardman came back.
You're in his chair.
He doesn't like that.
You told her?
I didn't have to.
The partners don't know what to think.
We don't just need to convince a jury I'm innocent.
We need to convince them I'm innocent.
Because if they don't trust Harvey...
They don't trust me.
And if they don't trust you, and it ever comes to a vote, he'll win.
She's worked here.
She knows the other partners.
She can read them.
And I also know Hardman.
I never liked him.
I won't tell Hardman what I tell you.
Welcome back, Zoe.
Please state your name.
Harvey Specter.
Your full name.
Harvey Reginald Specter.
[Silently]
Do you consider yourself a liar, Mr. Specter?
Of course not.
Didn't you recently confess that as an associate you hid an important file belonging to a-- ooh, what was his name?
Oh, yeah, a Louis Litt.
That was a prank.
It was a one-time thing.
So you didn't do anything wrong?
I don't think so.
And when asked, did you claim that you knew nothing about it?
Yes.
Did you ever do anything to remedy the situation?
- No.
- Why not?
What was done was done.
"What was done was done."
And like you said, it was a one-time thing, right?
- Yes.
- Ah.
Was it?
Because I think maybe this is a pattern.
Information was hidden, you claim you knew nothing about it, you did nothing to rectify the situation, and years later, you maintain you've done nothing wrong.
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Sounds exactly the same as why we're here today.
Except there's one big difference.
- Your Honor--
- This time...
A man was killed.
No further questions, Your Honor.
What's done is done, right?
[Laughs]
The plaintiff calls Ms. Donna Paulsen.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred this document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
So you don't want to take this opportunity to state your employer's innocence?
- Objection.
- You can't object.
- Jessica will.
- Could you just...
Sorry.
Yeah.
Ms. Paulsen, do you consider yourself good at your job?
I do.
Have you ever stated to one Rachel Zane that you are indeed the best legal secretary in the city?
Mike, you can't.
Donna, I can.
Yes.
Ms. Paulsen, there was a personal date stamp from five years ago on the document that you're accused of shredding.
Was it yours?
I decline to answer.
Did it look like your date stamp?
I decline to answer.
Okay.
Then let me ask you this.
Would you believe that the best legal secretary in the city didn't know about a document, even though it had what appeared to be her date stamp on it?
I decline to answer.
And would you believe that that same secretary would have destroyed that document without explicit orders from her boss?
This is gonna be bad, isn't it?
Donna's gonna be great.
Just follow the script.
Well, Rachel's not Donna.
She's not guilty, and she can't be rattled.
You see how I rattled Harvey?
The jury listens to words, but they respond to fear.
And we don't have that...
Yet.
- What's this?
- Subpoena.
You want to depose me?
Okay, let's stop playing tiptoe through the tulips around the elephant in the room.
That's not a thing.
You know some things about Harvey, and I need to know them too.
You yourself said go after the man.
What better way to go after the man than to question the boy?
But I don't know anything about this case.
That's an evasive answer, Mike.
You're hiding something, and I smell fear.
I have to go to the restroom.
Wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Is it uncomfortable?
Well, now it is.
Good.
What.
Whoa, whoa.
Is that a polygraph?
- Yes.
- Nope.
You are under oath.
And I'll tell the truth.
You bet your ass you will, or I'll know.
[Clicks tongue]
We'll start with an easy one.
What's your name?
Mike Ross.
Where do you work?
Pearson Hardman.
What do you do for a living?
I practice law.
And where did you attend law school?
What?
What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- [Clears throat]
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.
I beg to differ.
Listen to me.
I know why the machine says you're lying.
You're nervous.
You don't want to rat out Harvey.
I get that.
But it's time you accept the situation.
This is happening, and you're going to have to tell me some things about Harvey.
I accept that.
Then answer the goddamn question.
I'm proud to say that I have a diploma from Harvard law.
Now it's time that you accept the situation.
I'm not afraid of you.
I wasn't there, and I don't know anything that's gonna help this case.
Do you want fear?
I'll get you Donna.
The answer's no.
I didn't even ask a question yet.
- Yeah, well you were going to.
- Yeah.
And you were gonna say no, but instead you're gonna say yes.
Oh.
That's funny 'cause I already said no to Harvey.
And you, my dear, are not...
Are not Harvey.
No, I'm the guy who told you not to destroy that document, and you're the girl who promised me she wouldn't.
- You know that I...
- Broke your promise.
Well, then I guess I just suck.
Because I'm breaking another one right now.
I told my attorney that I wouldn't talk to anybody at the firm until after this was over.
- You hired an attorney?
- Yeah.
I'd rather not go to jail.
I don't do roommates, and I definitely don't do orange.
Nobody's going to jail, Donna.
You can't guarantee that.
You dragged me into Harvey's office once, and you scold me about how much he loves his job.
Well, if you don't help him prep for Tanner, he's gonna lose in court, he is gonna get disbarred, and he is never gonna be able to do what he loves ever again.
- That is not fair.
- No, what's not fair is Harvey taking the blame for your mistake.
You know what, do whatever your attorney wants.
Come in.
Don't come in.
Go to the movies.
Take pilates.
I don't give a shit.
Because whatever you do, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Complainant would like to call
Ms. Jessica Pearson to the stand.
Sidebar?
This is just an attempt to make Harvey's attorney look bad in front of the jury.
What, you think Tanner's gonna make you look good?
You're a named defendant.
He has a right to call you.
Louis, will you excuse us for a moment?
You think I don't see what you're trying to do?
You want him to undermine me in front of the partners.
I'm acting in an unbiased manner.
It sure took you a while to jump in when Harvey was up here.
Oh, wait, you never jumped in.
Jessica, you chose to try this case.
You could have been up here.
Instead, you're down there.
Either take a knee or take that stand.
Would you say it's important to win at Pearson Hardman?
You don't get to be one of the top law firms in New York by losing.
What about Mr. Specter?
How's his track record?
Exceptional.
He almost always wins.
Almost always.
Is that why he's the youngest senior partner in firm history?
It's a factor.
And how much did the firm benefit with the Coastal Motors win?
I'd say the profits were somewhere in the mid 8 figures.
And if Mr. Specter had lost those 8 figures, would he have still made senior partner so young?
- No.
- Mm.
- No, he wouldn't have.
- How much did Mr. Specter personally gain as senior partner?
Oh, it's too soon to say.
He hasn't received his first bonus yet.
- Ballpark.
- No.
Are you that ashamed of how much you pay him?
No.
Well, then answer the question.
- Millions.
- And a junior partner makes?
Much less.
So win, and you're rewarded millions.
Win less, and no matter how much hard work, dedication, or administrative dominance is displayed, you get nothing.
Quite the incentive to do whatever it takes to "almost always" win.
I have to say, delicious dinner, fantastic wine... almost enough to make up for the mediocre company.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You're not mediocre.
See, that's funny, because you were talking about me.
There it is, the Specter smile.
What can I say?
It came with the name.
And you're never fully dressed without a smile.
Being fully dressed is overrated.
It is when you look like me.
Mrs. Robinson, are you trying to seduce me?
Did you just call me Mrs. Robinson?
Okay, first of all, I'm younger than Anne Bancroft.
Anne Bancroft was hot.
Which brings me to second of all.
I'm hotter than Anne Bancroft.
I'm hotter than Dustin Hoffman.
- Not in Tootsie.
- [Laughs]
[Laughs]
Are you afraid you're gonna lose this thing?
No.
You should be.
Why, because Louis had one good direct?
You walk through life like men want to be you and women want to sleep with you.
I don't always walk.
Sometimes I drive fast.
And it's exactly that kind of response that make the partners think you're an ass.
Being an ass doesn't make me guilty of fraud.
If they're right about who you are, what would make them think they'd be wrong about what you do?
Well, why don't you tell me?
You're the expert on warm and fuzzies.
You want to know how I know I wasn't the one to call you back?
Because I know why I wasn't the one to call you back.
Let me guess-- you didn't like me.
No, I did.
But in all the time I knew you, you never once showed me any vulnerability.
I told you how I felt about you.
But you never showed me.
So I had no way of knowing it's the truth.
And you could be telling the truth now, but if you don't show the partners some emotion, they're not gonna believe you either.
What do you want me to do?
Manufacture a few tears?
Harvey, when you're a defendant, you need the jury to protect you.
There's no way they're ever gonna protect you if they don't care about you.
The plaintiff would like to call
Ms. Donna Paulsen to the stand.
You got her to come in?
Just stick to the script.
Harvey won't know what hit him.
Ms. Paulsen, did Harvey Specter order you to shred that document?
I decline to answer pursuant to my fifth amendment rights.
Did you put your date stamp on that document?
- I decline to answer.
- Um...
I'm not gonna ask questions that you're just gonna plead the fifth to, so...
Had Harvey Specter asked you to bury something five years ago, would you?
He wouldn't ask me to do that.
That's not what I asked.
If he did, would you do it?
Oh, see, you're pausing, which means you're hiding something.
No, I'm not.
See, I think you'd do anything for him, and I know why.
Is there a question?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
What?
Do you love him?
That has nothing to do with--
It has everything to do with.
Why did your last boyfriend break up with you?
Ms. Paulsen, why did he end it with you?
He thought that I prioritized my work over our relationship.
Your work?
He asked you to choose between him and Harvey, didn't he?
- Yes.
- Who did you choose?
- Harvey.
- Because you love him?
Louis, stop.
It is not that simple.
Do you love him, yes or no?
Answer the question.
Louis.
You're with him all the time.
Your work revolves around him.
Your life revolves around him.
Objection, badgering.
You don't have a boyfriend, but the one you did wouldn't share you with him.
- Your Honor!
- Please, I just need a--
Do you love Harvey Specter?
Do you love Harvey Specter?
That's enough!
Donna.
You crossed the line.
Do not do this to me right now.
You humiliated Donna.
You kept pushing and pushing her for what, for fun?
What, you think I enjoyed that?
That made me sick.
You could have stopped.
You think Tanner would have stopped?
Travis Tanner does not give a shit about Donna Paulsen.
- You are not Travis Tanner.
- I don't--
- You did not have to do that.
- I did my job.
You really want to beat me that badly, huh?
You think this is about beating you?
This whole thing is about saving you.
Everyone is trying to help you because you screwed up.
This is all your fault.
And what just happened to that beautiful woman in there-- that's on you--
not me.
Are you kidding me?
Go home.
Shoo!
Go the hell home.
Look, I didn't know he was gonna do that.
And if you had known, would you have done one thing differently?
I am so sorry.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
- Okay.
Donna, I'm not...
- Harvey.
I know.
But you know what, sweetheart, maybe you are.
[Chuckles]
And I do not mean that as a compliment.
Look, I did what I did for the same reason you did what you did, to help Harvey, that's all.
Well, that worked out the same for you as it did for me, because, in case you hadn't noticed, in addition to screwing me, you completely shafted Harvey.
We had a script.
Wait, you trusted Louis?
You trusted Louis?
Yeah, I thought he would stick to it.
Yes.
Well, he didn't.
And you should have known that, because that is just who he is.
I am sorry.
But I'm-- [chuckles] People are who they are.
Thank you.
Okay.
I can fix this!
What's all this?
It wouldn't concern you.
Why is that?
Because you want to settle even if it means
Harvey getting disbarred.
If he loses in court, he'll get disbarred anyway.
My concern is for the firm.
It's not a personal attack against Harvey.
This whole thing is a personal attack against Harvey.
And you're gonna do something about it?
Tanner's cases, transcripts, appeals, decisions.
I know he did something illegal, because that's who he is, and I'm gonna find it, because that's who I am.
What are you planning on doing with it?
Leveraging that for a settlement?
I'm not against settling.
I'm against Harvey getting disbarred.
You really admire him.
- I do.
- Loyalty.
You can't buy that.
No.
You can't.
What are you doing?
We worked together all night once.
Let's do it again.
I hope this time turns out better than the last time.
Now we have them right where we want them.
Either you're better than I thought you were, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.
Trust me, the partners are starting to believe Harvey.
Why?
Because he protected Donna.
He was also protecting himself.
[Scoffs] Yes.
But they didn't see that.
They saw a man who cared about someone else.
His softer side.
And we need to give them more.
He won't want to.
And we both know Harvey won't do what he doesn't want to do.
Everybody knows that.
So what do we do?
Permission to treat the witness as hostile.
Permission granted.
He's hostile.
The day we met, you were working in the mail room of this law firm.
I don't recall that day.
Well, let me refresh your memory.
An associate had missed a filing, so he backdated the postage.
You came to me, and you said if the firm did not declare misconduct, you would report us to the D.A.
I don't like fraud.
It's no secret.
But what you did want to keep secret was the fact that you told me.
Why?
I didn't want to get in trouble.
No, you did it because if we'd won, an old woman would have lost her pension.
And if anyone found out that he was the one that told me, then they'd know that you cared.
Whatever you say.
You pretend like you don't care, but you do.
You care about the people you work with, you care about the people you work for, and you care about every one of your clients.
But you refuse to let people know.
Is there a question?
I just want to know why.
No answer?
Are you embarrassed?
Nope.
- Afraid?
- No.
Then why?
- Just let it go.
- You are under oath.
Then hold me in contempt.
For God sakes, what the hell happened to you?
What kind of damage was done to you?
Caring only makes you...
Weak.
They think you care, they'll walk all over you.
You weren't weak the day you walked into my office.
You were a man who believed that to win fairly was more important than to win.
And you still are.
And I've never seen anyone walk all over you.
Is there a question here, Your Honor?
No, there isn't.
- That whole thing your idea?
- I didn't know that story.
I asked you a question.
Don't give me that coy bullshit.
Excuse me?
You said you wanted to see through me, you did.
The least you can do is give me an honest answer.
Yes, it was my idea.
Harvey, your partners loved what they saw in there.
You're gonna win.
Bravo.
A tour de force.
I mean, that story?
It was so great.
But there isn't one shred of proof it's true.
Hostile witness, my ass.
I mean, before that story, we all believed you did it.
And I ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if he did commit that fraud, how hard is it to believe that he didn't concoct some bullshit on the stand to get himself off the hook?
That's my close.
We have one more witness to call.
Mr. Litt, do you resent Harvey Specter?
It's complicated.
No, it's simple.
Do you resent him for being better than you?
- He's not better than me.
- I understand.
It's so much easier to criticize someone else than it is to acknowledge your own shortcomings.
- Shortcomings?
- Mm.
My billables are higher than his.
My client list is better than his.
Yes, but I didn't ask you about those things.
What are you asking, Ms. Pearson?
Does the witness resent my client?
- Yes.
- Your own ambition aside, do you think Harvey Specter deserves to be senior partner?
Yes or no?
Yes.
Do you think he's an excellent attorney?
- Yes.
- And, as much as you hate him, do you think he committed this fraud?
No.
Defense rests.
Refusing to admit defeat even after defeat.
You really are like Harvey.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Well, who would you rather be?
Someone who believes it's more important to win fairly than to win.
Like I said, Harvey.
Yeah.
Not in this case.
You both cheated.
Excuse me?
Louis's testimony pushed it over the top.
But that jury, they didn't see Louis Litt believing Harvey's innocence-- they saw Travis Tanner.
And that is never gonna happen in court.
You do realize that you are chastising the managing partner.
[Sighs] With all due respect, it's not gonna matter what you are if Harvey gets disbarred.
We'll find a way to win.
You should be finding a way to settle.
There isn't an acceptable offer.
Yet.
Not just a pretty face.
I hope you brought a baseball bat.
You want to go another round with me, you're gonna need it.
It doesn't matter what I have, you're just gonna sucker punch me again anyway.
Boohoo.
You baited me.
You wanted to catch me on that tape, and you know it.
That's not what I'm talking about, and you know it.
You want to settle?
Let me save you some time.
We pass.
You can pass, you can sign it, or you could stick it up your ass, but this is the best you're getting.
- This gets me off the hook.
- Nice try.
You think I don't know this was your doing?
Harvey, next time have the balls to do it yourself instead of sending your errand boy.
Errand boy?
You got what you wanted, so stop playing dumb.
Daniel Hardman doesn't work you.
You work him.
- What the hell did you do?
- This is a good deal.
A good deal that costs every partner at this firm $100,000.
Including me.
We share the profits;
We share the losses.
There won't be a loss when I win this at trial.
The only reason you weren't willing to settle was Harvey's disbarment.
That's gone.
And I want to know how you made it go away.
- I found dirt on Tanner.
- What dirt?
You blackmailed him into a settlement.
I leveraged a deal that's good for the firm.
I said, "what dirt?"
Not your concern.
It's my concern.
I don't want what you did biting me in the ass.
You were already bitten.
And the last time I crossed the line and you found out about it, it bit me in the ass.
You cleared Harvey's name inside the firm.
We both know that's what you wanted.
Time to move on.
Let's let the partners put this to a vote.
Hardman got Tanner to settle.
Are you kidding?
[Laughs] It worked?
So it was your idea to use dirt to get a deal.
No, it was my idea to use Tanner against Tanner.
Box.
Me.
[Laughs]
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
And I'm not going to, 'cause we're not taking the deal.
Because you don't trust Daniel.
This isn't just about me.
Every partner is-- everybody is paying now.
Do you have any idea why Donna showed up to testify?
Because I convinced her to.
What?
Yeah, I made her do what I needed instead of what she wanted.
I did what you do.
And look where that's gotten us, you, me,
Jessica, Louis, everybody.
Take the deal, Harvey.
What did Hardman find in those files?
I don't know, and I don't care, because he just got every single one of us off the hook.
He can't be trusted, and you should know that by now.
No, what I know is that if you take this thing to trial, it's gonna cost us all a hell of a lot more than money.
[Scoffs]
And if you don't know that by now, after all this, then I don't think I should be the one learning from you.
This is your decision.
So, by a show of hands, those in favor of settling?
Thank you.
Now all those in favor of going to trial.
Split vote.
And it appears we have a holdout.
I vote we settle.
Let the record show we have settled.
Thank you for your time.
In light of recent events, there is one other issue I'd like to raise.
This lawsuit has caused some of you to question
Jessica's judgment and, by extension, her leadership.
Allowing this kind of dissention to fester hurts the entire firm.
Therefore, I am calling a partners' meeting, at which point we will vote:
Either Jessica will retain her position as managing partner, or I will resume control of Pearson Hardman.

Hi.
Welcome back to Love Connection.
Told you we'd be back in two and two.
Our next guest says she likes her men to be very wealthy.
Let's say hello to Robin Givens.
- Hi, Robin.
- Hello, Charles.
Don't ever call me Charles.
I'll go off. [Chuckles]
So, Robin, tell us about this wealthy thing.
Well, Chuck, I don't want people thinking that I'm the type of woman...
- who's only interested in the size of a man's wallet.
- Mm-hmm.
I mean, there are things that are just as important.
- Like what?
- Well, like what's in the wallet.
Am I right?
- [Cheering]
- Thank you.
Okay.
[Chuckles]
Robin, last time you were here, you picked a man to go out with.
Now you're back to tell us how it went.
Let's say hello to Mike Tyson.
Hello, Michael.
- Hi, Michael.
- Hi, Robin.
- How you doin', Chuck?
- Hi, there, Mike.
How are you?
Well, I got to say I'm really ecstatic to be here.
All righty, then.
Robin, tell us how the date started.
Well, at first, I called Michael and, of course, things didn't go very well... because he's just a boxer from Brooklyn... and, of course, I was a Harvard medical student.
What about you, Mike?
What did you think of Robin?
Well, Chuck, when I first saw Robin, I was ecstatic.
I mean, she had this...
she had this really tight dress on... you know, the kind with the push-up bra... and her breasts were, like, poppin' right out.
Like hit me right in the eye, you know?
And as soon as I saw them, Chuck, I said, "Wow.
I'm in love," you know?
Sounds like you two really hit it off.
- So where'd you go first?
- Well, first, Chuck... we went to this lovely little jewelry store... where I allowed Michael to purchase me... a very lovely ruby, diamond and sapphire collection... and a matching car.
- Sounds nice.
Did you give Mike anything?
- Lithium.
It made...
It made me feel really ecstatic, Chuck.
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, we know, Michael.
We know.
So, where'd you go next?
Well, then we went to the most beautiful little wedding chapel... where my mother was waiting with a justice of the peace, and we got married!
- Thank you very much.
- [Cheering, Applause]
[Chuck] Mike, what did you think of Robin's mother?
Well, I got to be honest, Chuck.
I wasn't too ecstatic.
You know, I looked at her mom, the first thing I thought was...
"Wow.
This lady really needs a hair weave."
- And I'm, sorry, Robin.
- [Robin] Michael...
I'm really sorry, darlin', but your mom's head... her forehead is just way too big...
- and she just has too little hair to cover it, you know?
- Messy.
But I tell you something though, what really separates Robin from her mom is class.
Because the franks were still bothering me 'cause I had a boiled egg too.
And I kinda cut one in the car, you know?
And her mom made a big stink out of it. [Giggles]
Robin, we're almost out of time.
Tell us about the rest of the date.
Well, Charles... after the bank, the lithium began to wear off...
- and Michael went a little wild.
- [Mike] Oh, come on, Robin.
- What happened, Mike?
- Oh, well...
Well, Chuck, it was really simple.
It was quite innocent.
I was in the parking lot picking up the car...
I'm waitin' on Robin and her mom, and I see this girl.
She has a really nice butt.
So I walk over, I go, "Hi, my name is Mike."
And then I shove my tongue down her throat, you know?
And this guy comes over and goes, "Hey, that's my mother."
So I punch him in his gut, you know, and he started making little wormy noises.
It was pretty funny.
He was, like, "Oh, God, I'm bleedin' internally."
It was pretty funny, you know?
It reminded me of the Bonecrusher Smith fight... where I hit him in his third rib and then tried to push his nose up into his brain, you know?
- And I came over with...
- [Chuck] Whoa.!
Whoa.!
- I hit him and he went down.
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Ding!
Ding!
[Chuck] Ding.!
Wow, that was quite a date.
Let's see who our audience picked for you.
Was it Mike?
John KennedyJr.?
Or Donald Trump?
They picked Mike by 41%.
So if you two would like to go out again...
[Chuckles] Ultimately, Mike will pay for it.
Well, there is a lovely little fur salon I'd like to go to.
Michael, I wouldn't mind.
- [Giggles]
- What about you, Michael?
All right.
I guess it's all right, Robin.
Well, be sure to come back and tell us about it.
Hey, Mike, maybe I'll see you on Scrabble sometime.
Yeah, right.
Hey, "ecstatic." E-X-K-l-T.
- All right?
- Are you gonna tell him he's wrong?
[Chuckles]
Well, that's it, folks.
I'm Chuck Woolery.
Until next time, may all your dates be a matter of public record.

On July 20, 1969, Apollo astronauts Neil Armstrong...
Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins and Slick Johnson orbited the moon.
Collins remained in the command module... and Armstrong, Aldrin and Johnson... landed the small lunar module on the moon's surface.
While the men were exploring the area...
Armstrong received word from mission control... that a system malfunction had left them with only enough fuel... to take three of the four pioneers safely back to Earth.
After conferring with Collins and Aldrin...
Armstrong sentJohnson out to find a nice spot to play volleyball.
Minutes later, the landing module took off, leaving Slick behind.
Hey, come on, y'all!
Stop playin', man!
Hey, yo, that's not funny!
That's not funny, man!
Come back here!
The mission was an otherwise perfect success.
And an embarrassed NASA deleted all references toJohnson from its official literature.
Tonight, we salute SlickJohnson... the first black man on the moon.
I'm Tommy Davidson with another great moment in black history.

Hi.
This is Redd Foxx with your 1990 tax tips.
Tip number one... pay 'em.
Tip number two... if the I.R.S. Man show up to your house... lie... about everything, especially who you is.
Get back to work, you crusty old heathen.
Oh, Lord!
I thought I flushed my toilet.
I'm the one who save you from the I.R.S.
You belong to me now.
And when you finish cleaning' up and dustin' in here...
I want you to come in the room, massage my feet... and pop the pimples on my back!
Oh, Lord!
There's got to be a better way.
Somebody help me!
Eddie!
Richard!
Lamont!
Somebody tell MichaelJackson to come get Bubbles.
Come here, you old geezer.
You my love slave now.
If your breasts drop any lower, they're gonna be knees.
You got the devil in you!
Oh, Lord, somebody help me.
I'd give you five of these... but I don't want to get none of that dog spit on my hands.
You gonna make love to me if it kills you, Fred.
It will!
Elizabeth, I'm comin' to join you, honey... with a half a bottle of Ripple and an old toothbrush.
Save me!
Somebody, help me!
I was buying a shirt at this clothing store and I was out of cash.
So I gave the salesman my Equity Express Gold Card.
I got a call from the store manager.
He said he was suspicious of a customer trying to use an Equity Express card.
From the manager's description of the man... it was clear he wasn't the right sort to be carrying a Gold Card, if you know what I mean.
So I ran a check on his credit.
[Scoffs] I knew my credit was good, 'cause I just paid my bill.
But the manager asked to see my driver's license, I gave him that.
My birth certificate, no problem.
Mother's maiden name, I had that too.
You see, this had happened before.
He answered all of our questions easily.
There was no doubt that it was his card.
But I wasn't giving up so fast.
I asked to speak to the customer directly.
Then the lady asked me who won the Bob Hope Invitational Golf Tournament in 1978.
[Man's Voice] I said, "Kiss my butt, bitch."
Approve my credit.
I had him.
Use of obscenity over interstate phone lines is a federal offense.
So I asked the store manager to stall him while I called the police.
So they told me everything was cool... and they started treating me real nice, a little too nice.
They gift wrapped my shirt, they served me hors d'oeuvres and started doing magic tricks.
Then it got a little late, so I got up to leave.
[Woman] Luckily, the cops got there in time.
Sure he sued us and won... but it was still fun to do and the store manager was grateful.
[Woman] You see, helping people is what we're all about.
[Man] Equity Express, don't leave your crib without it... or your driver's license or your birth certificate... or your high school diploma, or your blood type... or your passport, or your dental records, or your fingerprints... or a notarized letter from the president.

[Announcer] And now, Public Access presents Men On Films.
- Hello.
I'm Blayne Edwards.
- And I'm Antoine Merriwether.
[Both] And welcome to Men On Films.
We're gonna be reviewing the latest films.
From a male point of view.
First up, is that controversial movie...
Do The Right Thing.
Now I like little Spike Lee's courage in making this film.
I especially liked the way he mixed the racial tension with the violence... in order to give his message:
Do the right thing.
Come on out of the closet.
Don't be afraid to be who you is...
- Black, white or whatever.
- Mm-hmm.
Ain't that the truth, Ruth. [Giggles]
Now I'd like to talk about an exciting new film...
Karate Kid, Part Three.
It's all about men working out their problems in a very physical way.
- It was all so primitive.
- Mm-hmm.
And I really enjoyed Mr. Miyagi, played by little Pat Morita.
Ooh, and that Ralph Macchio, three words...
Fab-U-Lous.
- Boy, I hope I look that good when I'm 40.
- Stop.
But I have to disagree.
I disagree.
There's just too much violence in this movie.
Don't get mad.
Stop.
[Indistinct]
You better give me back my scarf.
Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.
They went all wrong.
What's all this kickin' about?
This is a movie about relationships.
This could have been a beautiful picture about the special friendship... between a mature, masculine, older man... and a tender, ripening, consenting young man.
See, I think America's ready for that.
You know I know I am.
I bet you is.
Now I'd like to talk about a film I've been anxiously awaiting' to see...
Great Balls Of Fire.
I ain't gonna touch it.
But the title alone gets two snaps up.
Tell it.
- Why don't you stop.
- Yes.
Now let's talk about some films that are soon to come out on video.
First up is Black Widow, starring Theresa Russell and Debra Winger.
[Both] Hated it.
Also coming out is Miss Firecracker.
Is that Gene Anthony Ray's new movie?
Holly Hunter.
[Both] Hated it.
And we finally have Dangerous Liaisons... starring John Malkovich and Glenn Close.
You know, John Malkovich is like every moviegoer's fantasy.
I found myself just alone at night just thinkin' about his...
- intensity.
- Yes.
- What'd you think of Glenn Close?
- Oh, I loved him.
And I really have to admire the producers for daring to cast a man in that role.
I mean, that really made the picture for me.
Hello!
Glenn Close is a woman.
[Gasps] Clutch the pearls!
What a sneaky thing to do!
Why you always sayin' stuff like that?
Well, looks like we almost out of time.
Would you join us next week when we talk about Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon?
- I hope it's loaded.
- You crazy. [Giggles]
- [Cheering, Applause]
- Thank you.
All right.
On behalf of the cast and myself...
I want to thank you all for joining us tonight.
We'll see you next week.
Bye-bye.

It's not working.
It's not working!
Stop!
Great, nice job.
Now you're just getting us more stuck.
- This is your fault.
- You were yelling at me.
That's why you weren't looking at the road.
How is that my fault?
!
See?
!
Right there!
You're doing exactly what Dr. Wiseman said.
You're deflecting.
Nothing is ever your fault!
For the love of all that is holy, can we please fight about this when we're not stuck in a ditch?
Symbolic accident.
That's all I'm saying.
Let's just get out of here.
Just rock it, and when I say, give it the gas.
Don't order me around!
All right, rock it!
Yeah!
Good!
All right, rock it!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, more!
Yeah!
Step on it!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop the car!
Is this real or are you just trying to get attention?
No, something shot down my throat.
Here, give me a hand.
Come on.
Why do they eve bother printing the whole paper?
Why can't they just have one page that just says everything is horrible everywhere?
There's an interesting op-ed piece about the deadlock in the House Appropriations Committee.
That sounds like a fun morning read.
So what are you doing there?
"Should I run for president?"
I believe every American should consider what is his or her greatest contribution to the common good.
Right.
And yours would be running for president?
I'm brilliant.
That is not in dispute.
I have a profound depth of knowledge of the evolution of government from early Mesopotamian city states to the Ching Dynasty to Moorish caliphates, the laws of Ur-Nammu and Hammurabi...
Whoo!
Go figure.
You can't run for President of the United States, Bones.
Well, not this election cycle, obviously.
But look what
I have on my "pro" list.
"Excellent understanding of the criminal justice system."
Because of our work together.
And I have an impressive conviction rate, too.
Oh, "Empathy with the struggles of the working class."
I worked several minimum wage jobs while on the run.
I'm actually thinking of a tax plan...
You sort of just glossed over "on the run."
You know, you were a fugitive.
Where's that?
That's not on the list.
I was cleared.
Well, after evading arrest for three months.
Give me the pen-- fugitive, con.
Are you saying that you think I would be a bad candidate?
Because Donald Trump was thinking of running.
Booth.
Yeah, okay, we are on our way.
We are up.
Body in a ditch.
I hope you'll be more supportive if our daughter decides to run for president.
Well, we'll cross that bridge when she starts walking, okay?
So, the cop here, he tells me that this couple here, they were arguing and they ran off the side of the road.
I would suspend the licenses of reckless drivers.
Current laws are much too lenient.
You're making laws now?
She wants to be president.
Oh.
Excellent.
See?
Yeah.
Dr. Hodgins, is there any way to clear the insects off of the remains?
I know.
I am trying.
Where happened to the anterior portion of the victim's skull?
The tire was right on the head when they were trying to get out of the mud.
The wheels spun, tore off most of the face and sprayed it everywhere.
Our friend over there wound up catching a face full of face.
Primary cranial structure indicates a male Caucasian in his late 20s.
I've never seen a Presidential candidate I.D. remains before.
I tell you, you should put that on your "pro" list.
Dr. Hodgins?
Oh, thank you.
Okay, with that.
Hey, check it out!
Bug rapture.
Sorry.
This just makes me so happy.
Look at 'em go!
Okay, okay.
Compression-force trauma extends from his coccyx to his cranium, stopping at the frontal bone.
Getting crushed by the car may have something to do with that, Bones.
Just, you know...
So how long has he been in the ditch?
Well, the moisture from the mud makes it difficult to tell.
But as soon I get back to the lab, my six- and eight-legged friends here will give us an exact time.
The witness isn't feeling well.
He said he swallowed something when he was sprayed with person.
His stomach acid could be destroying evidence.
Sprayed with person?
Hold on-
- Bones...
Excuse me.
My name is Dr. Temperance Brennan.
I understand you may have swallowed some of the remains.
No.
It felt like a rock.
Okay, should we get him back to the Jeffersonian?
Not necessary.
Please open wide and say "ah."
Ah...
Ugh!
Wow.
What did you give him?
Ipecac syrup.
It induces regurgitation.
A leader has to be decisive, Booth.
I certainly wasn't going to wait for him to pass it-- tooth.
He swallowed a tooth.
You lost my vote.
Thank you.

Significant damage to the capitate, the hamate and styloid process of the third metacarpal.
The radiating splintering is suggestive of a high velocity strike, most likely a gunshot wound.
1.6 centimeters in diameter.
If it was a bullet, it was probably from a nine-millimeter fired at very close range.
Shot in the hand.
Torture, maybe?
Look at that crown on the third molar in the fourth quadrant of the mandibular arch.
Based on discoloration, it's unlikely to be more than five years old.
It's the only clean tooth in the bunch.
The lingual surface to the first molar is fractured down to the dentin.
There are two fillings in disrepair and heavy calculus buildup at the gum line.
Why fix one tooth but not the others?
When I am president, I will introduce a bill which will allow every American to get good dental care.
It will involve a simple five-tier system balancing variable efficiency measurements and parametric funding models.
Ah, finally.
Huh.
What is this?
What is that?
Newspaper.
Yeah, he was wearing boots that were much too big for him.
Bad teeth, bad boots.
Our victim came from a lower caste.
We don't have castes in America.
Wow.
Would you care to look me in the face and say that?
Oh, God, did this just morph into a racial thing?
Blowfly larvae indicate time of death to be between five and eight days ago.
And the date on this newspaper is from six days ago.
These treads are really jammed with evidence.
I might be able to tell you the last place this guy walked.
I see nothing giving us cause of death yet.
Shallow grave at the side of the road, gunshot wound...
I'm gonna throw caution to the wind here and call it a suspected homicide.
Hey.
Well?
Well, it's ours.
We officially live together.
Ooh!
I've never lived with a man before.
Me neither.
You're so funny.
Laughter is gonna be the main sound in our apartment.
And sex.
Hopefully, not at the same time.
Okay, so the little one is the mailbox in the lobby.
Mm-hmm.
And the kitty...?
...is the front door, monkey is the deadbolt.
And...
Oh, here is the clicker for the garage.
I've never had a clicker before!
I gotta go!
What about your lunch?
Uh, what's mine is yours.
I'll see you at home tonight.
At home tonight.
Oh, I'll get some wine and sparklers.
Then we can really celebrate.
Oh, it's on.
Ooh!
How am I supposed to reconstruct a face with a big hole in it?
Do everything but the hole?
Way ahead of you, smarty-pants.
Booth asked me to do some approximates.
These look great.
Stop humoring me.
How are you doing?
I'm having trouble, too.
I mean, all I found is buckshot, spun sugar, animal feces, fragments of stained glass and common limestone gravel, which tells me that our victim was at some kind of county fair-type place before he was killed.
Wow.
That's quite a lot.
Yeah.
Plus the purple in this glass, right?
It's manganese oxide.
It's rarely used to color glass today.
Now see these little imperfections?
These are manmade by localized heat treatments.
That's a method that was perfected in Venice.
The Venetian glass, I get.
Yeah.
So I do a fast search, right?
And I found that there's an antique show, which advertised "hundreds of authentic Venetian glass from the turn of the century" which was here last week, because where else would a day laborer step on Venetian glass?
This is you "having trouble"?
Oh, my God, you just looked at me with pity.
No...
Ange, come on.
We're a team, right?
"High tides lift all boats"?
Okay.
Yeah, that's gonna come back to bite me later.
Dr. Sweets?
Hey!
What are you doing in the bone room?
Uh, towels.
Daisy was torn between thread counts, so she wanted me to take a look at these.
And she couldn't send you a link?
Yeah.
That's what I suggested.
But apparently you can't feel the Internet.
And there's no medio-cam to check the thread count, so...
Of course.
Yeah.
It's quite overwhelming moving in together, huh?
Oh, it's great.
I mean, all I had was an old chair, a TV, video games...
my towels were old and ratty.
So, I get it.
Not a pretty picture.
No.
But now I get the woman's touch, you know?
A full set of silverware, ottoman, something called a duvet.
I always thought that men hated all that stuff.
Are you kidding me?
No, we love it.
When we miss living like pigs, we go camping.
I'll have to remember that.
Yeah.
I wish you and Ms. Wick much happiness with your new towels.
How could you not be happy with these?
Feel this one.
Feel it.
Okay.
Oh!
Okay, this is nice.
Right?
Nice.
Yeah.
Hey.
Is it hard for women moving in with a man?
Is that why you said I'd hate this?
Oh, no need to get all shrinky, Dr. Sweets.
Sorry.
Never mind.
But, actually, um... when I moved in with Michelle's father, there were times that I didn't want to compromise, I think.
Sort of like I missed my old ratty towels.
Mm.
But I didn't have these.
These are awesome.
They are.
Can't wait till Daisy shows me under the medio-cam.
I'll bet.
Well, I should get back to work.
Enjoy.
I will.
Thank you.
Well, not much here, Bones.
Hodgins says that two days before the victim died, this area was home to cotton candy, uh, shotgun pellets, camels and this gravel, so I'm confident this is the place.
Shotgun pellets?
Yeah.
Gun show two days before the antique show.
You know, this would be an excellent venue for a political rally.
I don't know, Bones.
It'd be kind of embarrassing if the turnout wasn't too strong.
Oh, it'd be strong.
Okay.
Don't you worry about it being strong.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh, you and you.
That's all I need today, guys.
Hey.
Hey, come on, gu, I'm sorry.
Just come back in a couple of days before the car show, okay?
Come on!
Okay, you two.
Okay, start over there.
Work your way back here, okay?
Thanks, Juan.
You got it.
Yeah, no worries.
Hi.
Hi.
Well, something tells me you two aren't here looking to pick up some unskilled labor.
No, no, we are both extremely skilled.
I'm very skilled.
FBI-skilled, pal.
You're looking to see if I'm hiring illegals?
Because I'm not.
These are all people who lost their jobs, you know-- legal citizens.
Tough times.
Some days, I think
I'm going to get mobbed for minimum wage work, man.
Under my administration, the private sector will receive incentives to increase hiring.
Bones, let's just...
no campaigning while we're doing the investigation, okay?
Okay.
We think that one of your minimum wage workers might have been killed.
Wow, man.
Who?
I don't know.
You missing anyone?
It's a pretty fluid bunch.
I'm their last resort, you know.
Do you recognize any of these men?
Uh...
That one could be Jared.
Jared...?
Jared... uh, Andrews.
No, no, um...
Jared Drew.
Jared Drew.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, what can you tell us about Mr. Drew?
He's been coming around for a year or so.
Good worker.
Never complained, always looking for more.
Sometimes intense competition for limited resources results in violence.
What?
What she means is minimum wage workers...
I mean, any of them likely to go after the competition?
Wait, wait-- Jared was murdered?
Yeah.
Wow.
Uh...
I don't know.
I mean, uh, maybe.
Yeah, thing is, I don't really get to know these guys.
Because they are below you on the social scale.
No.
Wait a second there.
I feel bad sending them away.
I get to know them as people, that's why I feel bad.
I mean, look at them.
I only have work for two.
What about all the other guys?
The victim's name is Jared Drew.
He was a day laborer.
- He used to have his own business?
- Yeah, owned a hardware store.
Wow.
He lost everything in the crash.
Suddenly he's competing for minimum wage, unskilled jobs.
Bones and I just got back from the fairgrounds.
You should have seen this.
There were 20 workers raising their hands for two jobs to pick trash-- garbage.
Does Dr. Brennan have a plan for the economy?
Okay, Sweets, let's not encourage her.
I don't know.
You know, she's very smart.
Maybe she's exactly what this country needs.
Oh, yeah, 'cause she was wanted for murder, she took peyote with the Indians, and her dad was a hard-core criminal.
I don't think I should start printing up
"Bones for President"
campaign buttons any time soon.
It's Daisy.
She's smiling and looking happy.
What's the big deal?
We're moving in together.
She's, uh... she's putting together a little celebration.
Sweets, the case.
Mm-hmm.
Victim.
All right, has no criminal record, but check this out, huh?
Right there.
Restraining order filed two days before the murder by Marcy Drew?
His ex-wife.
How is your reconstruction coming, Ms. Wick?
I hope you'll be pleased, Madam President.
"Dr. Brennan" is fine.
For now.
I found arthritic markers on his knuckles and wrists that predate the gunshot wound.
It's in the nascent stages and asymmetrical.
A day laborer should present symmetrical wear to his joints.
There are over 100 types of arthritis, Ms. Wick.
I'll examine the cell structure to see what we're dealing with.
How will you deal with the CIA?
That would be a problem for me.
I can't keep a secret.
You must realize that espionage is a crucial tool for diplomacy as well as national defense.
But you wouldn't tap my phone or anything.
A campaign must be designed to persuade the electorate that the candidate is on their side.
Which means it is sometimes necessary to lie.
So my answer is... no, I would not tap your phone.
Oh.
You did an excellent job of reconstructing the skull, Ms. Wick.
I know.
And it seems as if we have cause of death-- because of me.
Chiseling shows the bullet path was through the frontal sinus and exited through the right superlateral occipital.
The entry wound and surrounding damage measure 1.828 centimeters.
That would suggest a .45-caliber bullet.
But Dr. Saroyan said that the gunshot to the hand was probably from a nine-millimeter.
Two guns.
Which means we're likely looking for two killers.
This is terrible.
I never wanted anything like this to happen to Jared.
But you did file a restraining order against him.
He was coming around all the time.
He wouldn't leave Marcy alone.
You were listed in the restraining order, as well, Mr. Young.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jared was getting aggressive.
That had to stop.
I don't think that Jared would have hurt us, Mike.
You want to take a chance like that?
Huh?
Preemptive action.
You can never go wrong with a little preemptive action.
You seem angry.
Jared was coming around all the time begging me to take him back.
Marcy's with me now.
Okay?
I'm taking care of her.
I'm taking care of the kids.
All right, Jared's life with her is over.
Certainly is now.
Was he ever violent with you or the children?
Jared?
Oh, God, no, no.
No, he was just...
He was a loser.
He upset the kids.
That hardware store was passed down from Jared's grandfather.
And-and trying to hang onto it, we lost our condo and every penny we had.
He couldn't find any work?
He tried to get on with one of the big home improvement stores, but...
He would have had to move away from the kids.
And since you and Mike here were already together...
Who told you that?
Uh, you did, just now.
Obviously, you feel guilty about leaving your husband.
Ex-husband.
He was a good man.
He was a good provider until he lost that store.
I had to think of my kids.
Right.
You know, often, though, people feel the need to get rid of whatever it is that makes them feel guilty.
No, that's not it.
Do either of you own a gun?
I would like a lawyer.
Me, too.
Not another word without a lawyer.
Dr. Saroyan, have you seen the excrement that I left on my desk?
Think before you speak, Hodgins.
Some people might not understand what you're referring to.
Oh.
That's a good point.
So, have you seen it?
Yes, I took your excrement.
I wanted to study it.
Ooh.
Now everything sounds terrible, doesn't it?
Awful.
I wasn't finished cataloguing what the animal ate.
You'll have plenty of time.
I wanted to get my hands on the ex.... evidence to see if it contained epithelial cells.
Apparently, she hit the mother lode.
The epithelial cells came from a variety of exotic animals.
So far, I've found monkey cells, cougar and digested wolf cells.
Yeah, and all the animals were at a pet expo.
Jared Drew had work there, mucking out the, uh, holding pens.
Have your bugs given you time of death yet?
Yeah, six days ago.
Oh, that was during the pet expo.
This must have been his last job.
Oh, man.
Turns out these expos aren't just for puppies and kittens anymore.
Exotic pets are a $10 billion a year industry.
You're exaggerating, right?
No, there are more pet tigers in Texas than there are in the wilds of India.
What kind of lunatic wants a wild animal as a pet?
I think "lunatic" pretty much describes who we're talking about.
I'm sorry.
I don't know him.
He worked at your pet expo.
Doing what?
Cleaning up.
Oh, I don't hire the day laborers;
the fairground does that.
What kind of people come to these things?
Oh, awful people, really.
Families, retired people.
Antique shows, they draw stolen goods.
Gun shows draw illegal weapons.
Okay, yeah, I can see where this is going.
We don't do any traffic in illegal exotics.
My pet expo is not only in compliance with every local and federal law, but it is also approved by eight animal rights organizations.
It is a family event.
No, cougars and bears are not for families.
They are legal.
The vendors breed them right here in the U.S.
Nothing illegal about it.
These animals aren't domesticated.
It is cruel to treat them as pets.
Well, some would say that it's horrible to watch a lion taking down a zebra, tearing it apart and eating it.
These animals are spared that fate.
Look, I came here to help, not to be attacked for doing something perfectly legal.
All right, simmer down, Bwana Bob.
I comply with the law.
Now, is there anything else, or do you just intend to berate me because we see the world differently?
I believe you will be very impressed when I tell you that this arthritis isn't really arthritis.
I'd be more impressed if you told me what it is instead of what it isn't.
Beginning stages of osteonecrosis.
See here?
On the ulna at the styloid process.
And here, more damage at the olecranon process.
What causes that?
Blood poisoning?
Exactly.
And when sepsis makes its way into bone, it presents as septic arthritis.
What caused the blood poisoning?
Point of entry was here.
See the linear striations on the victim's right lunate and trapezium?
Ouch.
Those cuts are pretty deep, almost like he was slashed.
Scratching the victim down to bone, and inserting the bacteria directly into the victim's bloodstream.
What kind of person doesn't go to the hospital after an injury like that?
A very poor person?
He could've gone to the emergency room.
Either he couldn't get to a hospital, or he was prevented.
Let's see if Hodgins can take some samples and figure out what slashed him.
I'm just saying that you're more important in the lab than I am.
Is this some kind of test?
I give them faces, which, more and mo is just not the way to identify victims, and then, sometimes, I show how they died.
That is very important, Angie.
God help me, if you get into that
"All boats rise in a flood" thing...
"High tide raises all boats."
Yeah.
What?
You said flood-- a flood is a natural disaster.
What?
Most boats would sink in a flood.
Tide's good, flood's bad.
Seriously?
Ask New Orleans.
I'm telling you that I'm feeling inadequate, and you're talking about boats.
I mean, it's totally...
Hey, Sweets!
Hey!
Come here.
Hey.
Save Hodgins' life.
Hey.
Uh... don't you want to finish your your fight?
Whoa, Sweets thinks we were having a fight.
Yeah, well, he clearly doesn't know what a fight is.
I gotta go.
I'm gonna go figure out how our victim's hand got slashed.
I love you.
Hey.
Sit down.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Why?
If I were a psychologist,
I'd say that you overreacted to the slightest disagreement between me and Hodgins.
Because I'm at a turning point in my own relationship.
I was gonna say that maybe you're nervous about moving in with Daisy.
No, I've... yeah, well, I'm a little nervous.
You're getting cold feet.
No!
Why would I?
It's...
It's not like we're getting married.
Moving in together is-is... you know, it's a minor commitment.
Minor.
Oh, boy.
What?
Is it possible that maybe what you're seeing as a minor commitment, Daisy is seeing as...
The beginning of a whole new life together.
Yeah.
It's like you never studied psychology at all.
Yeah.
You found something?
Yeah.
Keratin.
From a claw?
Feline.
He was slashed by a cat?
Yeah, but not the kind that you're thinking.
Don't be so sure.
DNA results from the epithelial cells you found in the victim's boot tread.
Okay, if you say tiger, then we are on the same page.
A Siberian tiger.
Wait-- a pure-bred Siberian tiger?
According to the DNA.
Does the type of tiger make a difference?
Yeah, see, buying and selling cross-bred tigers is legal... but a pure-bred Siberian tiger, I mean, that's... that's a felony.
Definitely motive for murder.
Well, it's only murder if we can find cause of death.
I found cause of death.
I should've seen this earlier.
I was a coroner in New York.
Wait-- seen what earlier?
Dr. Brennan said that the splintering showed that the bullet entered through the palm and exited through the back of the hand...
Yeah?
Shoot me.
I beg your pardon?
No-- with the marker.
Shoot me.
Um... okay, bang--
It was a defensive wound.
The bullet went through the victim's hand and then into his face.
A hollow-point bullet.
It expanded entering the hand.
That's why we thought a nine-millimeter entered his hand and a .45-caliber
entered his face.
One bullet, one gun, one shooter.
Our victim is attacked by a pure-bred Siberian tiger.
The wounds he sustained gave him blood poisoning, but he did not seek medical help-- why?
That's what I'm asking you.
Because if he tells the hospital that he was attacked by a Siberian tiger, he ends up in prison, right?
Okay, the body was found here, on the north side of the road.
The road dead-ends in this valley.
There's five farms there.
So, if the body was found on the north side of the road, he was heading out.
After delivering the tiger.
Right.
Okay, so maybe the buyer of the tiger sees the victim's wound, realizes he's gonna have to go to the hospital...
No, no, no, no, that's too risky, okay?
Buying a tiger is a felony, Sweets.
Right, right, so, maybe... the buyer offers to drive the victim to the hospital, kills him along this deserted stretch of road.
You should search those five farms for a tiger.
I don't have enough for a warrant, okay?
That's why you're here.
- I don't understand.
- I need you to put together some kind of psychological mumbo-jumbo warrant for these five farmers.
Booth, I'm a professional, okay?
I can't just make things up, so you can get a warrant.
You're not helping me.
You... you're not.
Wouldn't it make more sense if I talked to the guy that runs the pet expo?
I mean, maybe one of these farmers is known to be an animal collector.
That's a good idea.
Thank you.
You know what?
He's in the interrogation room, okay?
You have at him.
Gotta go.
You just... you just totally conned me into doing that.
Booth!
Yeah.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Well, that depends on how personal here.
Okay, um... was it a big deal for you to move in with Dr. Brennan?
What do you mean?
You know, big deal, like... getting married.
Whoa-- living together is not getting married, okay?
Getting married's a big-boy commitment.
Okay, yes, yes.
I totally agree with that.
For me.
But, for Bones, that was a... that was a huge step, you know?
Living together.
The only reason she even considered it was because she was pregnant.
Okay, so...
Dr. Brennan's the most rational human being on the planet... and, to her, moving in together...
Big deal.
Big.
Huge.
Huge.
Huge.
Breathe it out, kid.
You'll get him.
Okay.
None of these names mean anything to me.
Who-who are they?
We have reason to believe that one of them bought a Siberian tiger on the black market.
Oh, here we go again.
Mr. Neibling, the victim worked at the fairgrounds during the time of your pet exposition, all right?
He was injured by a Siberian tiger.
Maybe one of these, one of these farmers made suspicious inquiries.
10,000 people came through that expo.
We had over 200 exhibitors.
An innocent man is dead;
we're just exploring every avenue.
If he was transporting a pure-bred Siberian tiger, then he was not innocent.
Okay, but he didn't deserve to die.
I'm not sure I agree with that.
These smugglers, they don't care about the animals, and they interfere with my legitimate business.
Now, what happens if the press finds out that you're questioning me?
My reputation goes right into the toilet.
We won't leak your name to the press.
All right, well, let me take the names.
I'll ask around.
If I hear anything suspicious, I'll get back to you.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate your help.
I love farms.
Someday, Lance and I will have a farm of our own.
The pet expo guys didn't recognize any of the farmers' names.
Yeah, but what are the chances that a guy is gonna buy a Siberian tiger with his real name, anyway?
Oh!
Oh!
I could call in an anonymous tip like:
I hear roaring at night.
I was thinking more along the lines of looking at satellite photos on the Internet, and seeing if any of the farms shout "tiger!"
That is brilliant.
Okay, here they are.
Kinda grainy.
Yeah, well, this is just what the government allows us to see on the Internet.
You know they keep all the good stuff for themselves.
Could those be endangered animals?
Are blobs endangered?
Let me try a fractal enlargement program.
I'm guessing cows.
Pigs!
Which are not endangered.
Unless you factor in bacon.
Are those cages?
Yeah... they could be.
"Could be" will not get us a warrant.
Yeah, and these images haven't been updated in over a year.
What we need is our own satellite.
Oh!
We've got one!
All of Neibling's permits are up to date-- there's no citations, no violations, he even got an "A" rating from the Better Business Bureau.
Legality notwithstanding, why would someone willingly keep these animals as pets?
People who live where these creatures are indigenous, take great lengths to keep these animals away from their homes.
Look, I'm with you, man.
You want to see a wild animal, go to the zoo.
Oh...
I do not like zoos.
What do you mean?
It's a zoo.
Keeping animals captive for human entertainment is just wrong.
Come on!
Don't ruin the zoo for me.
I used to go with Pops.
I have great memories there.
I can't wait to take Christine.
No, that will not be happening.
It's educational, okay?
What, if she doesn't go to the zoo, how's she gonna learn about the animals?
The satellite system you insisted that we buy provides us with 16 animal-themed channels.
One, just for penguins.
It's not the same, okay?
The TV won't give you a balloon.
The balloons end up in the ocean, and very often choke seals.
Okay, all right, you know what?
Find something bad to say about the kitty train they have.
Burns fossil fuels just to go round and round in circles.
Cotton candy.
Encourages Type 2 diabetes.
I could do this all day, Booth.
Fine, fine.
Just know that someday, we are getting a dog for Christine.
Hm.
Possibly.
Studies have shown that children who grow up with dogs have stronger immune systems.
And you can play ball with them.
If you say so.
I do say so.
And you know what?
We're gonna name him Gretzky.
Well, we'll see about that.
Yeah, it's Gretzky.
Here, Gretzky!
Gretzky boy!
Come on, boy!
Gretzky!
I am using a World War II Spitfire, so...
I don't have a lot of range.
And I thought you didn't have a lot of range 'cause you're using a toy.
A hobbyist does not play with toys, he works with replicas.
All right, so, you getting the signal?
Yeah, yeah, and I like the replica, sweetie.
It's awesome.
Fine.
I'm the bad guy.
All right, here we go.
Ooh, we're getting a good signal.
A goat... more pigs... lots of cows...
Try to limit the play-by-play to the exotic animals, Ms. Wick.
Well, I grew up in the city, so they're all exotic to me.
Can you get any higher?
It's a Spitfire.
Cages!
Can you get up under those trees?
Uh-huh...
What are those?
A camel!
Zebra!
Is that a wolf?
A kangaroo!
You know, Booth can tell a judge that we got this video from a hobbyist.
This is definitely enough to get us a warrant.
Oh, no, no, no...!
Ooh!
Aw...!
Aw.
Thomas Casey, FBI!
Casey, open up!
We have a warrant!
Booth, the cages are over here but...
I don't see a tiger.
Bones, wait up.
Bones!
There's a wolf, a kangaroo, a zebra...
All legal, Bones.
The state doesn't even require them to be registered.
Really?
You have to register for a dog but not a wolf?
It's horrible, Booth.
None of these animals should be kept like this.
If only you were president, Bones.
Hey!
If only.
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?
You can't be here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, okay?
FBI.
We have a warrant.
For what?
I haven't done anything wrong.
What about these animals?
They're not meant to be kept as pets.
Hey, all these animals are legal.
Well, we're here about your Siberian tiger.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You see a tiger?
Because I don't.
What I see is an empty cage over there.
You waiting for something?
I hope I can find a chimp.
Chimp?
Oh, my God.
What?
Carrion birds.
What?
That's bad.
Go.
Go!
Go!
Go!
You shot it!
You killed it!
I had to; it was out of control, trying to get out and go for the other animals.
Whoa, easy.
You shot your own tiger?
How could...
How could he do that?
How could you do that?
!
Easy, easy!
Relax.
All right, easy, easy, easy, easy.
Okay, it's all right.
It's gonna be okay, Bones.
Don't worry about it.
What I want to know is how many things we can charge him with.
Well, we got him killing an endangered species.
Does that carry the death penalty?
$50,000 fine, a year in jail.
When I am president, killing tigers will be a death penalty offense.
Well, the president isn't actually a dictator, Bones.
That's right.
I'll have to convince two other branches of the government to execute animal traffickers.
You know what, you're very persuasive when you set your mind to something.
That animal was beautiful.
It was beautiful and rare, just like you.
You should leverage the tiger buyer into ratting out whoever he bought the tiger from.
Sorry, did you hear what I said?
It was very sweet.
Maybe we can bring down the entire criminal organization.
Right, let's do that.
Let's bring them all down.
I shot that tiger in self-defense.
It was a man-killer.
You're lying.
We are charging you with murder.
For the tiger?
!
No, for Jared Drew.
Who is Jared Drew?
He's the poor bastard who delivered the tiger to your farm.
He's dead?
Yes, he's dead.
That guy was really sick.
He could barely stand up.
He probably died of whatever disease he had.
We think that you offered to drive him to the hospital.
Killed him on the way.
And then buried him at the side of the road.
I didn't drive him anywhere.
He was too sick to drive himself.
You said it yourself.
He didn't have to drive himself.
There was the other guy.
Other guy?
What other guy?
Two of them brought me the tiger.
What did the other one look like?
I don't know.
He waited in the truck.
I never got a good look.
Yeah, well, we're still charging you with murder.
But I didn't kill anyone.
Yeah, but purchasing that tiger and transporting it over a state line, that's a felony.
Someone dies in the commission of that felony, everyone involved is guilty of homicide, pal.
Right there, that's why, when I'm president, you get appointed to head up the FBI.
There we go.
Thank you.
Who was the man in the truck?
I don't know.
I'll tell you everything
I do know.
You write down that I cooperated.
Sure, go ahead.
I'm looking online for cool animals for my collection, five clicks later, there's somebody wants to sell a Siberian tiger.
You bought it online?
"Siberian tiger available.
Serious inquiries only."
No names.
Just a e-mail telling me to meet a guy named Juan at the fairground, give him half the money in an envelope.
I only took an envelope from the guy.
I didn't even know what was inside.
Come on, Juan.
You know what an envelope full of cash feels like.
You took the money and then delivered a tiger.
A tiger?
The money was for a tiger?
The envelope full of cash, who did you give it to?
Mr. Neibling.
Eric Neibling?
I don't know his first name, man.
It's Mr. Neibling, the boss.
I give him the envelope, he gives me 50 bucks.
He asks me to send him a good worker, he gives me another $50.
You sent him Jared Drew.
Poor guy, man.
All he wanted was to make enough money and hold his head high with his wife and kids.
You know what, this makes complete sense to me now.
You saw the buyer's name on the list that we gave you.
So what do you do?
You call him up, you say, "Quick, get rid of the tiger."
Show me the phone records you've got to prove that.
I thought so.
Something wrong with you?
You need a glass of water?
I got a stomach bug or something.
He's sick.
What you have is nascent osteonecrotic septicemia.
Blood poisoning.
You got it when you shot Jared Drew in the face.
Right, from the blowback.
I got the sniffles from shooting someone?
Come on, do you know how much face time I have with the public?
He has to have a fragment of the victim's bone somewhere in him.
How big?
A sliver, probably in his face.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna leave.
Whoa, you're not going anywhere.
His face looks fine to me.
Sit down.
Sit.
Where else does blowback hit?
Put your hands on the table.
I want a lawyer.
You're gonna need one.
Put your hands on the table.
Right-handed.
Right hand holds the gun.
If I went to the hospital and they found out about the tiger,
I would've been ruined.
Look at that, huh?
You traded in 50 grand and a year in jail for the death penalty.
Lance!
Hey.
Welcome home.
Why didn't you go in?
I thought we'd go in together.
Hi!
Hey.
Is this your place?
Yeah.
Oh, wow, it looks great.
Yeah.
We'd invite you in but...
Oh, that's okay.
We'll have a housewarming party when we're settled.
You should carry her over the threshold.
Girls love that stuff.
Oh, don't bother.
I had a lump on my head for weeks and he threw out his back.
Threshold-carrying is kind of a marriage thing, and we're not actually...
We will do it.
Lance is so strong.
Okay, well, we'll leave you to it.
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
See you guys.
Um...
I'm not doing it.
I'll wrap my arms around your neck and hang on.
It will be easy.
No, I'm...
I'm not going into the apartment.
Oh, why?
Because I-I underestimated the meaning.
Which is ironic 'cause, you know,
I'm trained to discern nuance.
Stop talking like that.
When were you thinking we'd get married?
I don't know.
A year maybe.
Sooner if I get pregnant.
You want to get married before we live together.
That's fine.
My answer is yes.
No, no, no, no.
I'm...
I'm not thinking about getting married at all.
But we're moving in together.
Um, I misconstrued the significance.
I got it all wrong.
I'm so sorry.
Um...
First month's rent and last month's rent is paid.
So you have two months to figure out what you want to do.
We're not moving in together?
We're breaking up.
I'm...
I'm really sorry.
I really am.
Caroline offered to drop the charges to second degree murder if Neibling gave us the names of suppliers.
Good.
I hope Caroline puts all of them in little cages.
Right.
Did you know that Abraham Lincoln was a bartender?
Grover Cleveland was a hangman.
Andrew Johnson was a tailor.
Well, I'm sure you would be the smartest president.
I'm not sure.
James Garfield could simultaneously write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other.
That's just a trick.
So now you think I'd be a good president?
Um, no, I don't.
You know you're an atheist, you're not diplomatic, and you think America is an empire.
America is an empire.
And I really, really wouldn't give you your own army or nuclear weapons.
That would just be a disaster.
Because I'm like a tiger?
Excuse me?
Earlier today, you said I reminded you of a wild tiger.
I did.
You do.
You called me rare and beautiful.
Like a tiger, you said.
I thought you didn't hear.
Wild tigers do not have the qualities of a good president.
You know what, Bones,
I wouldn't vote for you, but I would definitely encourage other people to vote for you.
That's irrational.
Yeah, well, so is politics and love.
I think you're trying to convey that you no longer would like to discuss politics.
Unless we're talking about JFK and Marilyn Monroe.
Booth, what are you doing?
Where are you going?

Come on, Sweets.
Open up.
I'm in the middle of work, Booth.
No, you're not.
I can see you right through the window.
Get up.
Open up the door, Sweets.
Let's go.
- Okay.
- Come on.
Come on.
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
There you are, my friend.
Ah, Sweets, you can't keep sleeping in your office like this.
- You didn't have to bring me coffee.
- The coffee's mine.
But I did print up some apartment listings for you.
Take a look.
This place is a mess, huh?
Oh!
I can't believe you gave Daisy the apartment.
You know, I broke up with her.
I can't take the apartment too.
Come on!
Man, look at you.
You gotta shake it off.
Right?
Get a new girlfriend.
Get a new place to live.
Yeah, thanks.
I'll check these out.
You've been sleeping in this office for two weeks.
You're gonna go cuckoo.
If anyone knows what cuckoo is, that would be you, Mr. Shrink.
Maybe I'm dealing with a few things that are preventing me... from moving on as quickly as I could.
A breakup like this makes one reevaluate-
Oh-Oh.
Work calls.
Uh, the dead waits for no man.
Okay.
That-
Yeah, okay, let's get back to work.
All right, I'll tell you what, Sweets.
Why don't you just come and... stay at our place for, like, a night or two?
Really?
Yeah.
So you can clear your mind, you know.
Get ready for your next move.
Thank you.
Clear my mind.
Here, have a coffee.
You're back.
Come on.
Let's go, Sweets.
I'm coming.
You invited Sweets to move in with us?
I know I should have asked you first, but you should have seen him.
He was pitiful.
I mean, it was bad.
But it's just for a couple of days until he finds his own place.
Okay.
Was that an â€œokayâ€ okay, or â€œyou can't be seriousâ€ okay?
I don't know what that means.
It means that we're talking about Psychology Sweets here.
You know, the guy who drives you crazy.
He's going through a difficult time.
It takes a village, Booth.
I learned that living in a village.
Sweets will be gone in a couple days.
I promise, okay?
Gone?
Gone where?
Is he okay?
- Booth invited Sweets to live with us.
- Not to live.
To stay with us for a couple of days until he finds his own place.
Is he still dealing with his breakup from Daisy?
Yeah.
I feel bad for the kid, you know?
it's-it's tough.
Aw.
He's going through an early-life crisis.
Good luck.
Good luck?
I don't need luck.
This is not about luck.
This is about a friend extending to another friend.
It's like an olive branch that-Stop.
Can we just stop and deal with this here?
The remains.
What's up with this?
Based on the width of the greater sciatic notch... and the dorsal margin of the pubic face, this was a female.
Early to mid-20s.
There's no organs to examine, so there's nothing for me here.
Ugh.
Whoa.
The Coch/iomy/'a macel/ar/'a eggs and larvae... measuring upwards of four millimeters means our victim's been dead for about 36 hours.
- Is that a foot?
- That is a foot.
Hey, so, uh,
Sweets told Angela that he was never getting involved with anyone again, so...
- good luck with that.
- Let's stop with the luck stuff, okay?
Can we just deal with what's going on in front of us?
Okay, Bones, so it only took a day and a half to get down to bone?
Heavy sharp-force trauma indicates that tissue, muscle... and viscera have been ripped from her bones.
Where's all the gutsy stuff?
I think I might have found it.
Yeah.
Gutsy stuff.
Whoa.
[ I 300th ] Uh!
There's a leak.
Oh.
No guts, no glory.
Good luck with that.
Numerous deep incisions to the glabella, supraorbital ridges, zygomatic arches-
Her face was scratched off.
Thoracic and pelvic regions... and the extremities.
Oh, my God.
This is awful.
Yes. it will take some time to catalog.
Judging by the mass, this has to be almost all her ï¬‚esh.
With this many wounds, there should be particulates from the weapon on the bone.
It's gonna be difficult to isolate cause of death.
- It'll be a doozy.
- Yes, a real doozy.
We should get whatever ï¬‚esh is still on these bones removed.
Okay, just please tell me that this poor thing was dead... before any of this happened.
- I'm sure she was.
- Definitely.
Great.
Hodgins and Cam are lying to Angela...
- to spare her feelings.
- Yeah, I got that.
Because we have not in any way ascertained... if the victim was dead or alive... when she was ï¬‚ayed to the bone.
We have ascertained actually.
Acute liver hemorrhaging suggests... that the victim was still alive... when she was eviscerated.
- So I out-and-out lied to Angela.
- Thank you for that.
What kind of monster guts his victim and then removes all her ï¬‚esh?
In 1957, Ed Gein was arrested for murder.
And while searching his home, police stumbled upon... bowls made of human skulls, lampshades of human ï¬‚esh, even a belt made out of nipples.
The heinousness of Gein's crimes... diminishes in comparison to those of the Aztecs.
More heinous than a nipple belt?
In order to appease Huehueteotl, the fire god, the Aztecs would burn their captives alive.
Moments before death, the human sacrifices were pulled from the fire... to have their still-beating hearts ripped out of their chests.
- Those were the good old days.
- Those were the bad days.
What-What kind of freak feels nostalgic over human sacrifices?
I'm gonna go ahead and plead the Fifth on that.
Severe chipping to the frontal, nasal and zygomatic bones... prevents a complete facial reconstruction.
Does that mean that Angela's off the hook for this one?
- Yes.
- Yes!
- Um, actually-
I hate to be the one to suggest this, but Angela might be able to reconstruct the face from the face.
You mean the face from the skin, right?
I have an ear, some cheek and part of a nose.
I'll see what else I can dig up.
That is a very good idea, Cam.
No need to tell Angela that this was my very good idea.
Teamwork!
So, you stay in here.
Parker won't be visiting us for a couple months, so-
Sorry about all the junk and toys.
Oh, no.
Beats the hell out of my office.
Look at all this stuff.
Kids from broken homes... really rake in the material goods... by way of compensation.
Right.
Uh, take a look at this.
Take a closer look, all right?
What?
Oh, my God.
This corpse is so mutilated.
Cut right down to the bone.
So you're a psychologist.
Who would do something like this?
Want me to figure that out right now?
No, I tell you what.
Why don't you just relax.
Make yourself at home.
Huh?
Take things in.
All right.
Thanks.
Yep.
This is the last piece of facial tissue I found.
Thank God.
This is not why I went to art school.
I'll start loading the images into the computer, and I'll piece them together, and then I will hurl.
Well, how long do you think it'll take you... to piece the pieces together?
Oh, not long.
I am starting a pool on how long Sweets lasts... with Booth and Brennan.
I say he's out tonight.
Did you swab the cuts in the bones?
I did, yes.
Yeah.
So are you in on the pool?
I give Sweets four days.
What'd you find?
Uh, ammonium hydroxide.
It's the same stuff... that's all over our victim's clothing.
So, Angie, how long do you give Sweets?
I say he lives with them permanently from now on.
What's ammonium hydroxide?
It's a cleaning product.
- The killer probably used it to wash away the evidence.
- Huh.
Did it work?
Yeah. it's wiped out all the other evidence as far as I can see.
Wh-What do you mean â€œfrom now onâ€?
I mean for the foreseeable future.
They will adopt him.
Well, I don't have a box for infinity.
I mean, the furthest I went was a month.
Okay.
Then I'll take the month.
Our killer is sick and smart.
I hate that combination.
Okay, so, this program will search for wrinkles, freckles and other microscopic facial features on each piece, pick up the pattern, and pair it with the corresponding piece.
- Very Frankensteiny.
- Ew.
Okay, so I'm gonna wrap the face around the image of the victim's skull.
Pop in eyeballs and hair.
Okay.
What do you think?
That most definitely looks like a human person.
I know this woman.
You do?
Oh, my God.
Wh-What?
Is this a friend of yours?
Not a friend but-Whoa.
Okay.
This is Michael Vincent's favorite applesauce.
And what does that have to do with our victim?
Someone killed the Them Apples applesauce lady.
Them Apples applesauce is owned by the two girls that are on the label,
Jessica Pearson and Brooke Guminski.
It's the applesauce I buy for Christine too.
What the hell is going on here?
Pumpkin butter.
What is this, olden times?
Olden times is not a legitimate historical reference.
But I see your point.
Right.
There's a pickle maker and a candlestick maker.
Oh.
I know what this is.
Okay.
What is this, a time portal?
No, this is an artisanal community, Booth.
Oh, that's just ridiculous.
From an anthropological standpoint, the artisanal subculture is fascinating.
Really?
Fascinating?
Well, to me, I think it's just stupid.
Hmm.
The founding fathers were heavily inï¬‚uenced by the Athenians, which resulted in democracy.
Care for a sample?
So- Uh, great.
Democracy, Bones.
Not a pickle.
Enjoy your pickles.
And if you want some more-Creating handcrafted, handmade products... provides artisans with the authenticity they feel is lacking... in today's technology-driven, industrialized world.
Great.
Okay, eat your pickle.
We're here.
These are very good.
You should have eaten yours.
That's nice.
I don't want a pickle.
In the 1930s, Joseph Ball killed over 20 women and fed their remains to alligators.
Was this victim fed to alligators?
I don't think so.
Please shut up about alligators.
Hemorrhagic staining indicates these wounds were made around time of death.
The dimension of the â€œVâ€-shaped incisions suggests the weapon used to create them was a blade.
Those are some seriously deep cuts.
Which only a serrated blade should be capable of making, but I'm not finding any evidence of striations in these wounds.
- Meaning?
- Whoever did this is incredibly strong.
You okay?
ls there someone we should call?
Usually, I'd say Jess.
We ran this place together.
- I can't believe she's dead.
- She is most certainly dead.
Very sorry for your loss.
[ Snifï¬‚es 1
When was the last time you saw your partner?
Saturday afternoon.
We had a pretty good morning at the farmers' market.
We had lunch.
I dropped her off at the free clinic.
Wow.
She was my best friend.
You charge nine dollars for a jar of applesauce?
Yes.
You pay nine bucks for this stuff?
Yes.
Every apple is handpicked from local orchards.
No chemicals, no additives.
You think somebody killed Jess because we charge nine dollars for applesauce?
Uh, so, um, what was the purpose for her going to the, uh, free clinic?
Jess had lupus.
She went in for her monthly checkup before starting a sales tour.
She was gonna cover every farmers' market in Maryland, starting with Baltimore.
We were just starting to make a go of this.
Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your partner?
- Maybe.
- Maybe?
There's this creep, Adam.
- He's been getting kind of stalkery with Jess lately.
- Stalkery how?
Kept bringing her meat.
Meat?
No, that's definitely not normal.
Oh, no-yeah.
Adam is a butcher.
He's creepy, but he's the butcher down the street.
Yeah, I'm Adam.
What do you want?
Okay, Adam, F.B.l., all right?
Let's put the cleaver down.
Have to ask you a few questions.
Here we go again.
You know, my shop is safer than any regulations that agribusiness paid for.
I source all my meat locally, all grass fed.
- No hormones of any kind.
- Hey, pal, I don't care about your meat.
We just have to ask you a few questions about the death of Jessica Pearson.
Death?
What are you talking about?
Ms. Pearson's mutilated remains were found in a garbage can... a quarter of a mile from here.
Oh, my God.
That's horrible.
Wh-What happened?
Our evidence indicates that the murder was committed by an exceptionally strong man... skilled at using an extremely sharp knife.
You think / killed Jessica?
- Well, we know you were trying to romance her.
- With free meat.
Look, Jessica could barely afford food.
Every dime of hers went into her business.
I was just trying to help her out.
For what in return?
Nothing.
Especially after this guy came in and threatened me.
- What guy?
- I don't know.
Some big-ass, angry-looking guy... threatened to crush my skull like a cracker if I didn't lay off Jess.
Adam, do you rub ammonia on your meat as a way of killing bacteria?
This is an artisan butchery.
I'd never use chemicals.
Look, you can accuse me of murder, but when you start insulting my craft, that's where I draw the line.
Good to know your priorities.
We need to examine your knives as possible murder weapons.
You want my knives?
Get a warrant.
You find any more money in her clothes?
Yep.
It was mixed up in the garbage.
Oh, yeah.
The smell was a dead giveaway.
Let's see what we got.
So, we found 20 hundred-dollar bills on the victim.
That's a lot of money for a girl who can barely afford to eat.
Well, Brennan said that the victim was at a farmers' market... selling her applesauce the morning before she died.
Maybe that's where she got the money.
No, I don't think so.
Look at this.
The bills are sequential.
Meaning that they came from the same source.
We love our kid, but we're not spending two grand a month on applesauce at a farmers' market.
What is she doing with all this cash?
And why was she making monthly trips to the doctor for blood tests?
Her partner said that she had lupus.
I know, but she didn't.
I tested all the tissue.
Our victim was perfectly healthy.
She was lying to her partner, but the question is why.
Regular doctor visits for no reason, a wad of cash.
You think she was selling pills?
Want more?
Aw.
Booth is upset that I pay... nine dollars a jar for Christine's applesauce.
Well, artisanal products are more expensive to produce, so they're more expensive to purchase.
But the real value comes in knowing that they're not made... by some faceless, soul-destroying corporation.
You seem to have a real appreciation for the artisan, Sweets.
I used to work in a record shop.
I'm afraid Christine will never know what a record is.
Digital will never replace vinyl.
Hey there, you three.
Huh?
Let's go, Sweets.
- Booth, Sweets was going to get a hotel room.
- Hotels are nice.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- No, if you stay at a hotel, you will feel rushed and you'll take an apartment... that does not align with your sensibilities.
Wait a second.
Sweets has sensibilities?
Yes.
He worked in a record shop.
- So?
- I think what Dr. Brennan means... is that working in a moribund enterprise gave me a lasting appreciation... for the craftsmanship that goes into making a record.
You know, I remember stocking this T. Rex album.
Uh, the one with â€œ20th Century Boy.â€ And the liner notes, the album art, even the tactile feel of the vinyl-
- And so you need an apartment that tickles your same fancy.
- Yeah.
Whoa, whoa.
Excuse me.
Those are my underwear, pal.
What is he doing?
Sweets has been very helpful.
He vacuumed, did the laundry.
All right, that's great and all, but a man doesn't fold another man's underwear.
Are those Captain America boxers?
Booth has a nostalgic side too.
You know, psychologically, we yearn for our past because we fear our future.
Or you just like Captain America or old records or your own apartment.
So can we go now?
Come on, we have a doctor to talk to.
Let's go.
Thanks.
Thanks for that.
Appreciate it.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I saw Jessica at the clinic just last Saturday.
Is she okay?
Jessica was murdered last Saturday evening.
Oh, my God.
Was, uh, Jessica healthy, Dr. Reese?
Yes.
Very.
Why?
Why did she come visit you every month?
Well, that's confidential information.
Thank you.
Not when your patient's been murdered.
We found a lot of cash on her, so we're thinking maybe the two of you were selling drugs.
That's absurd.
You wouldn't be the first doctor... to make a little extra cash distributing pills on the street.
Jessica needed money.
That isn't why she had an appointment every month.
I have to tell you, legally?
I'm afraid so.
I don't want you to get the wrong impression of Jessica.
Okay.
Well, try us.
Jessica came to the clinic once a month... to have her blood tested for S.T.D.'s.
S.T.D.'s, cash- Jessica was a prostitute?
It's not my job to tell my patients how to live their lives.
I just want them to stay healthy.
- Pig bones?
- Yes.
And I believe Dr. Brennan will heap praise on me for acquiring them.
Not as if that will cheer me up.
And why?
'Cause I got 'em from Adam Borchardt.
From his butchery.
- The suspect?
- It's a lot easier than waiting... for a warrant that might never come.
I figured if our butcher butchered the victim, he might have done it in a similar manner in which he would butcher an animal.
I might have to heap a little praise on you too.
It would be wasted.
Look at the cuts on our victim's bones.
Each one extremely precise and clean.
No clefts, no hesitation marks.
Definitely made by someone who knows what they're doing.
Like the butchered pig bones.
And the ï¬‚esh was removed in a similar way as our victim's.
Is it true that she was a lady of the night?
According to Booth, she may have been prostituting herself... as a way of supplementing her income.
An occasional prostitute.
Interesting.
I was thinking sad.
The nicks on both sides of the mandible appear to be at the ends of an arc... that would've transected the victim's left-side carotid artery.
The killer slit her throat.
Judging by the microscopic spalls, the nick on the right side of the mandible would be the exit wound.
Meaning the killer was right-handed.
Which rules out our left-handed butcher.
I don't look so good now, do I?
- Does that cheer you up?
- A little.
Oh, my God.
The killer slit her throat.
That's now old news.
And she was an occasional prostitute that was dumped in the garbage.
There is more than butchery and applesauce that's old-school here.
The killer is mimicking Jack the Ripper.
Do I even want to know?
Dr. Saroyan. it's past 10:00.
What are you still doing here?
Oh, digging through the booze-soaked lobster ravioli I found in the victim's stomach.
Last meal, huh?
2,000-buck-a-night call girl- definitely not skimping on dinner.
You might be able to find what restaurant she went to.
Your turn.
I am examining the victim's remains.
By the light of a lantern?
Oh, the lantern provides oblique lighting, which bounces off an angled reï¬‚ector and back onto the bone, which happens to be awesome for spotting scratches and micro cuts on bone.
But mostly it's because it appeals to your sense of the macabre.
It does make me look insane, doesn't it?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
But what if I told you I found something?
Microfracturing on the anterior aspect of the right radius and ulna... is inconsistent with the â€œVâ€-shaped incisions.
So, not caused by a blade.
Nope.
What do you think caused them?
Well, I do not know, but I can certainly keep looking.
And people think I'm creepy because I'm a pathologist.
- Bones.
- Yes?
Is Sweets in our bathroom?
Yes.
Should I have put a note on the door?
Well, a little warning.
That would have been nice.
What's he doing in our bathtub?
- Jets.
- Our jets in our bathtub.
Societies in Japan and Turkey encourage public bathing.
- In modern-day Finland-
- Finland?
Whoa, whoa!
This is not Finland.
Sorry, Booth.
I should have locked the door, huh?
Because you played on so many sports teams and spent a lot of time in the army,
I assumed you were comfortable with male nudity.
You know, fear of nudity is called gymnophobia?
Okay, listen, Psychology and Anthropology,
I liked it better when you two were fighting, all right?
Are we done with our bathtub?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like to soak in our tub after work.
If you'd seen Booth's X-rays, you'd understand.
The list of bones that he hasn't broken is shorter than the ones that he has.
Really?
Now what?
Yeah?
- Hey, is Dr. Brennan home?
- What the hell are you doing here?
Sweets, looking right up your skirt there.
We weren't expecting guests.
We're not expecting- What are you do-Hello?
Time out.
Can this not wait until tomorrow?
Okay, check this out.
Microfracturing on both wrists.
Very symmetrical.
The victim was restrained.
This is looking more and more like an abduction-torture scenario.
This can't wait until tomorrow because?
This probably isn't a one-time thing.
We have a serial killer!
That's what I'm saying.
Jack the Ripper is back.
- Jack the Ripper.
I don't buy it.
- Why?
Because serial killers don't dump their victims in garbage.
Let's go.
Out!
Out.
Get out of the house.
Bye-bye.
Done.
Back to the lab, squint.
And you, Sweets, go put some clothes on.
- Oy!
Now I have to go clean the tub.
- Thanks to Sweets.
What did I do?
You don't need to clean it.
Just get up the stairs, Sweets.
What am I, a Sasquatch?
Yes.
This artisan world.
That's why I studied art in the first place-to pursue my true passion.
Hey, I thought I was your true passion.
Good God.
You know what I mean.
Yes, I do.
My true passion are bugs and slime, and yours is art.
But come on now, I think we're doing pretty well.
Dr. Hodgins, what does an ethanol composed of rye, juniper berries... and licorice mean to you?
Juniper berries and rye points to gin.
Licorice-
Is it part of the liquor or-or separate?
In the liquor.
It was the last thing our victim drank before she was murdered.
Was there a sign of any drugs?
Rohypnol?
Narcotics?
No.
Well, hey, gin can be pretty debilitating all on its own.
But she didn't drink all that much.
Well, you'd think a prostitute would deaden the pain... with anything she could find.
I hope someone isn't targeting prostitutes.
It would help if we could talk to the pimp, but Booth's had a hard time tracking him down.
- Old Tom Gin.
- Excuse me?
Old Tom Gin is an old-fashioned English gin sweetened with licorice instead of sugar.
It's extremely rare today.
- It sounds like more artisans.
- Yeah, Cam is right.
Old Tom Gin is made at Dr. Biltmore's micro distillery. [Typing I
Which is a few blocks from our victim's applesauce store.
- And, oh, boy.
- What?
Dr. Biltmore's is owned and operated by Dr. Cole Reese.
The doctor that treated our victim.
Maybe it's a coincidence.
Sure.
Reese had his own practice, but closed it to open up the distillery.
So, uh, he volunteers at the free clinic.
These people all seem to be following their dreams.
Reese is following something, all right.
Look, read his record.
Right.
Arrested for solicitation in 2003.
You know, one of the most prevalent theories about Jack the Ripper... is that he was, in fact, a physician.
The clinic would be an ideal way to pick victims.
Right, and to ensure that the victim wasn't an undercover cop.
Hmm?
That too.
Yep.
♪♪
Booth, the front door is off its hinges.
♪♪
Looks like Reese is really into the good old days.
Sounds like he's not alone.
I'll-I'll get the door.
Shh.
[Whimpering 1
Drop it, Reese!
Drop it.
Just give me an excuse.
Just one.
You know, most doctors live by a code of ethics.
Â€œDo no harmâ€ is one of them.
And who was I harming, Dr. Sweets?
I'm the victim here.
You're the- Excuse me?
You were caught tying up a woman, holding a knife.
Harmless role-play.
And paying Jessica, who was one of your patients, that's also harmless?
Yes.
I follow my passions.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
It's moralizing psychologists like you that make society puritanical and narrow-minded.
It's psychologists like me that understand that you are- to coin a 19th-century term you might be familiar with-a paraphiliac.
I don't want to kidnap and ravish an actual unwitting young woman.
So I hire someone to play the role of the damsel in distress.
That's all these events were.
Buteventhough you were paying her, you still had to get Jessica drunk to get her to play along.
Jessica had never been handcuffed before.
She was nervous.
I was hoping that a libation would loosen her up a little.
Well, judging by the fractures on her wrists,
- I guess that didn't work out too well, did it?
- Jessica began struggling.
She was screaming to be let go.
Since you're into bondage, seeing her in pain must have turned you on.
I'm not a monster.
Listen, that poor girl was making herself bleed... trying to rip the handcuffs from the bedpost.
I took them off her as quickly as I could.
Next thing I know, the front door is kicked in, this 250-pound behemoth throws me across the room.
Her pimp?
Bodyguard?
He stuffed me in a closet.
Did he Say anything?
No!
I mean, he was obviously furious.
But he was silent.
No threats, nothing.
Well, we'll be analyzing all of the surgical instruments from your clinic, Dr. Reese.
Be my guest.
And the antique medical equipment we found hidden in your apartment.
Those tools are very valuable.
That's the only reason that they were hidden.
These antiques are beautiful, but the edges are far too rough to have caused the injuries we found.
If I were to create a calendar of history's most ghoulish killings, the Black Dahlia murder would have to be my December.
Had medical examiners in 1947 had access to the technology we have today,
Elizabeth Short's murder would have certainly been solved.
The medio-cam would have easily unearthed particulates left behind by the murder weapon.
The considerable space between the blade and the â€œVâ€-shaped incision... suggests this knife is too small to be the murder weapon.
But we've only just begun.
Sure looks like the doc loved his sharp objects.
And we have casts of some of the bone injuries.
Will you tell me again about the French nobleman who bathed in the blood of children?
In a moment, Mr. Fisher.
Okay.
Both knives appear to be tilted downward in the femur... at the same 45-degree angle.
And it looks like a 45-degree angle on the humerus... and the radius as well.
All of these incisions appear to have been made in a downward motion... at precisely the same angle.
Meaning?
The killer was even more precise than we had originally thought.
Well, I can't think of anyone more precise than a doctor.
I wish his tools agreed with you.
Hey, Booth, I wanted to apologize for last night.
I totally took advantage of your hospitality.
That wasn't cool.
Uh, don't worry about it, Sweets.
You know what?
It's a-it's a great tub.
Oh, it really is.
Those jets are awesome.
Stop.
All right, enough with the tub talk.
Okay.
Um, I'm looking for an apartment.
That's good.
You know what?
That's a great first step.
Oh.
What is it?
None of the doctor's tools match the injuries of the bones.
I gotta admit, I'm off the doctor as a prime suspect.
So, what are you thinking?
It was the pimp?
Well, I'm wondering why a pimp would interrupt his prostitute at work.
She could be freelancing.
Cutting the pimp out of the equation.
Yeah, that could get someone killed.
Or- Or?
The big guy was a client... who had developed feelings for Jessica.
You know, that kind of paranoid, unrequited love... could definitely fuel feelings of intense rage.
That's him.
That's our guy.
I gotta find him.
I gotta find an apartment.
Okay, so keep your eye out for a man, approximately 6 foot 6, between 250 and 280 pounds, dark hair.
I am looking for him anywhere near Reese's place.
I wouldn't imagine there would be... that many surveillance cameras in the neighborhood.
Yeah.
You know, none of the artisanal shops even use them.
Half of them don't even have phones.
In New York, the police eventually tracked down... the Son of Sam through a parking ticket.
A ticket.
That's genius, Cam.
This Web site collects all traffic violations... to analyze traffic ï¬‚ow and congestion.
- And?
- Reese lives one door from the intersection.
These are all the photos of the drivers caught running the red... on Reese's block on Saturday night when Jessica was with Reese.
You think he was driving?
No, no.
But look at the angle of the camera.
Right across the street from Reese's building.
There he is.
Look, in the background.
- You sure this is our guy?
- Well, yeah.
I mean, unless you see another 6-foot-6, 250-pound man... in front of Reese's building at the same time the victim was there.
Let's get the F.B.l. to put his picture on the nightly news.
See if the public can identify him.
Pretty cool.
Well done.
I saw my face on the news.
I turned myself in.
I did not kill Jess.
- That girl meant the world to me.
- What was it, Willis?
Did you end up buying a night or two with her and end up falling in love?
No, no.
You have it all really, really wrong.
Okay, why don't you tell me how it really, really is.
Jess was my niece.
Ah, you know, you're not starting off too good.
See, Jessica Pearson has no family members.
Not by blood.
Jessica's father and I were best friends since we were seven years old.
When he died,
I promised him that I would take care of his daughter.
That was 10 years ago.
And why should I believe you?
I got photos of me and Jess since she was five.
Okay?
Look.
High school graduation.
After that, I paid for two years of college.
You-You can check it all out.
As Jess got older, she didn't need me as much.
Maybe I reminded her of her dad.
I don't know.
She calls me out of the blue about some guy who was scaring her.
- The butcher?
- I took care of that.
But I'm not stupid.
I have eyes.
I saw how Jess's life was going.
- So you figured out that she was-
- Yeah.
I saw it.
- So you followed her?
- I heard her scream.
- So I kicked down the door-
- And you stuffed her client in the closet.
I came this close to killing him.
This close.
You and me could be sitting here now, only you'd be right.
Agent Booth, you got anybody that you're responsible for, who needs help even though they feel like they got to be out in the world on their own?
Oh, yeah.
Look, I'm in banking.
I'm not a big guy.
I'm a medium guy.
But I told Jess that I could get investors for her applesauce company... so that she could stop... taking clients for money and make a go of it.
Was she gonna take the deal?
She said she'd think about it.
And that was the last night you saw her.
Yes.
Okay, so this is a rundown of how the injuries were dispersed across the remains.
Four incisions to the skull, seven to the right arm, six to the left, eight to the thoracic region, two to the pelvis and another four on each leg.
It appears as if the spacing between the incisions on the left arm... is equal to the spacing between the incisions on the thoracic region.
Okay, that's interesting.
Okay, let me try the right arm.
Hmm.
Try the legs, Angela.
Whoa.
What is this telling us?
This is the position the victim was in when her ï¬‚esh was removed.
She was protecting herself.
She was cut 18 times with surgical-like precision.
Why would she stay in the same position throughout the entire attack?
Perhaps she was already dead at this point?
Or worse, she could have been paralyzed... and forced to bare witness to the systematic carving of her own ï¬‚esh.
There's something very odd here.
Yeah.
But you're gonna have to be a little more specific than that... for those of us who find this entire scenario odd.
These wounds are too regular, too precise.
Each one is calculated.
The surgical precision, the working knowledge of the human anatomy-
- I think the doctor's our guy.
- No.
The evidence indicates that this was done by some kind of machine.
Yeah, I believe if Jessica Pearson wanted to sell out, her partner might have been angry enough to murder.
Come on, really?
Over applesauce?
For artisans, it's their life.
You know, Brooke might have thought that Jessica was... attacking the very foundation of her life.
- Oh, better her partner is a prostitute than sells out?
- Essentially, yeah.
It's not about money for these people.
You know, artisans go into business... 'cause they're passionate about the products they create.
That is so un-American.
Hey, so, uh-I'm gonna move out of the house tonight.
Hey, you found a place.
You've been great, but I think we both know it's time I face the world on my own.
It's time.
Excuse me.
Brooke Guminski, we have a search warrant here for the premises.
Can't this wait?
I've got orders to fill, and I'm all by myself.
Well, you should have considered that before you killed Jessica.
We know Jessica came to visit you before she left for Baltimore.
- We know what you two were talking about.
- We didn't talk about anything.
She stopped by to grab a couple jars before she left town.
Booth?
Yep?
I believe I discovered the murder weapon.
- What do we have here?
- Nothing.
It's a ribbon blender.
We use it to blend spices into our sauce.
If the victim fell into this blender while the blades were spinning, her body would have become wedged to the side... where the blades would have continuously sliced her... at a 45-degree angle while removing her ï¬‚esh.
It was an accident, wasn't it?
[ Snifï¬‚es 1
- Bones?
- We are certain to find bone shards or splinters in here.
Look, it looks much better to the jury if you tell me that it was an accident... before Bones here finds any evidence.
It was an accident.
She told me she wanted to sell, and I slapped her and-
Would it have been so bad to make some money?
My parents only cared about money.
It destroyed their marriage.
It destroyed my childhood.
I didn't mean for Jessica to fall in.
I turned it off, but it was too late.
I didn't know what to do, so I cleaned up the mess... and I dumped the body down the street.
I'm sorry.
[ Snifï¬‚es 1
Sometimes I feel guilty feeling so good after Christine goes to bed.
It's good to be happy when the baby goes down.
Is it?
Yeah, it is.
It gives us time to be alone, huh?
This applesauce is pretty good.
Yeah.
You want some?
No.
The wine is fine.
It's not bad, I'm telling you.
Nine bucks.
A nine-buck applesauce is kind of like drinking a fine wine.
I mean, I'm telling you.
Plus, keeps the doctor away.
Actually, eating too many apples could do the opposite, since they contain a lot of sugar.
You could get diabetes.
Great.
That's nine bucks down the drain, hmm?
You know what?
Stick with the scotch.
Alone time.
Right.
- All right, thanks.
- What?
Wait.
You're leaving?
Yeah, I don't want to overstay my welcome.
Thanks a million though for-
Come on, Sweets.
Come on in.
You know, hey, have some sauce.
We have apple or wine.
But you can't have my scotch.
Uh, did I somehow give you the impression that you should leave?
Because you haven't overstayed your welcome yet.
Come on, put the bag back.
Put it back.
- Is this because you want to win the pool?
- Oh, you know about that?
Yeah, Booth only wins if I stay another two weeks, right?
- Is that why you want him to stay?
- No.
No.
Don't you think that as a man, I should be on my own?
I mean-
Most cultures have ceremonies...
- to celebrate milestones in a man's life.
- Oh.
Oh, God, this isn't about circumcision, is it?
No, it's about dancing.
What?
There are three important elements in moving on past an old relationship.
- Admission.
- I admit it's over with Daisy.
- Cleansing.
- Right.
You were in ourjet tub.
- And celebration.
- So I can't get my own apartment till I celebrate being alone?
- That's right.
- Anthropology is all about dancing.

Now you're just getting us more stuck.
- This is your fault.
- You were yelling at me.
That's why you weren't looking at the road.
How is that my fault?
!
See?
!
Right there!
You're doing exactly what Dr. Wiseman said.
You're deflecting.
Nothing is ever your fault!
For the love of all that is holy, can we please fight about this when we're not stuck in a ditch?
Symbolic accident.
That's all I'm saying.
Let's just get out of here.
Just rock it, and when I say, give it the gas.
Don't order me around!
All right, rock it!
Yeah!
Good!
All right, rock it!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, more!
Yeah!

Is this real or are you just trying to get attention?
No, something shot down my throat.
Here, give me a hand.
Come on.
Why do they eve bother printing the whole paper?
Why can't they just have one page that just says everything is horrible everywhere?
There's an interesting op-ed piece about the deadlock in the House Appropriations Committee.
That sounds like a fun morning read.
So what are you doing there?
"Should I run for president?"
I believe every American should consider what is his or her greatest contribution to the common good.
Right.
And yours would be running for president?
I'm brilliant.
That is not in dispute.
I have a profound depth of knowledge of the evolution of government from early Mesopotamian city states to the Ching Dynasty to Moorish caliphates, the laws of Ur-Nammu and Hammurabi...
Whoo!
Go figure.
You can't run for President of the United States, Bones.
Well, not this election cycle, obviously.
But look what
I have on my "pro" list.
"Excellent understanding of the criminal justice system."
Because of our work together.
And I have an impressive conviction rate, too.
Oh, "Empathy with the struggles of the working class."
I worked several minimum wage jobs while on the run.
I'm actually thinking of a tax plan...
You sort of just glossed over "on the run."
You know, you were a fugitive.
Where's that?
That's not on the list.
I was cleared.
Well, after evading arrest for three months.
Give me the pen-- fugitive, con.
Are you saying that you think I would be a bad candidate?
Because Donald Trump was thinking of running.
Booth.
Yeah, okay, we are on our way.
We are up.
Body in a ditch.
I hope you'll be more supportive if our daughter decides to run for president.
Well, we'll cross that bridge when she starts walking, okay?
So, the cop here, he tells me that this couple here, they were arguing and they ran off the side of the road.
I would suspend the licenses of reckless drivers.
Current laws are much too lenient.
You're making laws now?
She wants to be president.
Oh.
Excellent.
See?
Yeah.
Dr. Hodgins, is there any way to clear the insects off of the remains?
I know.
I am trying.
Where happened to the anterior portion of the victim's skull?
The tire was right on the head when they were trying to get out of the mud.
The wheels spun, tore off most of the face and sprayed it everywhere.
Our friend over there wound up catching a face full of face.
Primary cranial structure indicates a male Caucasian in his late 20s.
I've never seen a Presidential candidate I.D. remains before.
I tell you, you should put that on your "pro" list.
Dr. Hodgins?
Oh, thank you.
Okay, with that.
Hey, check it out!
Bug rapture.
Sorry.
This just makes me so happy.
Look at 'em go!
Okay, okay.
Compression-force trauma extends from his coccyx to his cranium, stopping at the frontal bone.
Getting crushed by the car may have something to do with that, Bones.
Just, you know...
So how long has he been in the ditch?
Well, the moisture from the mud makes it difficult to tell.
But as soon I get back to the lab, my six- and eight-legged friends here will give us an exact time.
The witness isn't feeling well.
He said he swallowed something when he was sprayed with person.
His stomach acid could be destroying evidence.
Sprayed with person?
Hold on-
- Bones...
Excuse me.
My name is Dr. Temperance Brennan.
I understand you may have swallowed some of the remains.
No.
It felt like a rock.
Okay, should we get him back to the Jeffersonian?
Not necessary.
Please open wide and say "ah."
Ah...
Ugh!
Wow.
What did you give him?
Ipecac syrup.
It induces regurgitation.
A leader has to be decisive, Booth.
I certainly wasn't going to wait for him to pass it-- tooth.
He swallowed a tooth.
You lost my vote.
Thank you.

Significant damage to the capitate, the hamate and styloid process of the third metacarpal.
The radiating splintering is suggestive of a high velocity strike, most likely a gunshot wound.
1.6 centimeters in diameter.
If it was a bullet, it was probably from a nine-millimeter fired at very close range.
Shot in the hand.
Torture, maybe?
Look at that crown on the third molar in the fourth quadrant of the mandibular arch.
Based on discoloration, it's unlikely to be more than five years old.
It's the only clean tooth in the bunch.
The lingual surface to the first molar is fractured down to the dentin.
There are two fillings in disrepair and heavy calculus buildup at the gum line.
Why fix one tooth but not the others?
When I am president, I will introduce a bill which will allow every American to get good dental care.
It will involve a simple five-tier system balancing variable efficiency measurements and parametric funding models.
Ah, finally.
Huh.
What is this?
What is that?
Newspaper.
Yeah, he was wearing boots that were much too big for him.
Bad teeth, bad boots.
Our victim came from a lower caste.
We don't have castes in America.
Wow.
Would you care to look me in the face and say that?
Oh, God, did this just morph into a racial thing?
Blowfly larvae indicate time of death to be between five and eight days ago.
And the date on this newspaper is from six days ago.
These treads are really jammed with evidence.
I might be able to tell you the last place this guy walked.
I see nothing giving us cause of death yet.
Shallow grave at the side of the road, gunshot wound...
I'm gonna throw caution to the wind here and call it a suspected homicide.
Hey.
Well?
Well, it's ours.
We officially live together.
Ooh!
I've never lived with a man before.
Me neither.
You're so funny.
Laughter is gonna be the main sound in our apartment.
And sex.
Hopefully, not at the same time.
Okay, so the little one is the mailbox in the lobby.
Mm-hmm.
And the kitty...?
...is the front door, monkey is the deadbolt.
And...
Oh, here is the clicker for the garage.
I've never had a clicker before!
I gotta go!
What about your lunch?
Uh, what's mine is yours.
I'll see you at home tonight.
At home tonight.
Oh, I'll get some wine and sparklers.
Then we can really celebrate.
Oh, it's on.
Ooh!
How am I supposed to reconstruct a face with a big hole in it?
Do everything but the hole?
Way ahead of you, smarty-pants.
Booth asked me to do some approximates.
These look great.
Stop humoring me.
How are you doing?
I'm having trouble, too.
I mean, all I found is buckshot, spun sugar, animal feces, fragments of stained glass and common limestone gravel, which tells me that our victim was at some kind of county fair-type place before he was killed.
Wow.
That's quite a lot.
Yeah.
Plus the purple in this glass, right?
It's manganese oxide.
It's rarely used to color glass today.
Now see these little imperfections?
These are manmade by localized heat treatments.
That's a method that was perfected in Venice.
The Venetian glass, I get.
Yeah.
So I do a fast search, right?
And I found that there's an antique show, which advertised "hundreds of authentic Venetian glass from the turn of the century" which was here last week, because where else would a day laborer step on Venetian glass?
This is you "having trouble"?
Oh, my God, you just looked at me with pity.
No...
Ange, come on.
We're a team, right?
"High tides lift all boats"?
Okay.
Yeah, that's gonna come back to bite me later.
Dr. Sweets?
Hey!
What are you doing in the bone room?
Uh, towels.
Daisy was torn between thread counts, so she wanted me to take a look at these.
And she couldn't send you a link?
Yeah.
That's what I suggested.
But apparently you can't feel the Internet.
And there's no medio-cam to check the thread count, so...
Of course.
Yeah.
It's quite overwhelming moving in together, huh?
Oh, it's great.
I mean, all I had was an old chair, a TV, video games...
my towels were old and ratty.
So, I get it.
Not a pretty picture.
No.
But now I get the woman's touch, you know?
A full set of silverware, ottoman, something called a duvet.
I always thought that men hated all that stuff.
Are you kidding me?
No, we love it.
When we miss living like pigs, we go camping.
I'll have to remember that.
Yeah.
I wish you and Ms. Wick much happiness with your new towels.
How could you not be happy with these?
Feel this one.
Feel it.
Okay.
Oh!
Okay, this is nice.
Right?
Nice.
Yeah.
Hey.
Is it hard for women moving in with a man?
Is that why you said I'd hate this?
Oh, no need to get all shrinky, Dr. Sweets.
Sorry.
Never mind.
But, actually, um... when I moved in with Michelle's father, there were times that I didn't want to compromise, I think.
Sort of like I missed my old ratty towels.
Mm.
But I didn't have these.
These are awesome.
They are.
Can't wait till Daisy shows me under the medio-cam.
I'll bet.
Well, I should get back to work.
Enjoy.
I will.
Thank you.
Well, not much here, Bones.
Hodgins says that two days before the victim died, this area was home to cotton candy, uh, shotgun pellets, camels and this gravel, so I'm confident this is the place.
Shotgun pellets?
Yeah.
Gun show two days before the antique show.
You know, this would be an excellent venue for a political rally.
I don't know, Bones.
It'd be kind of embarrassing if the turnout wasn't too strong.
Oh, it'd be strong.
Okay.
Don't you worry about it being strong.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh, you and you.
That's all I need today, guys.
Hey.
Hey, come on, gu, I'm sorry.
Just come back in a couple of days before the car show, okay?
Come on!
Okay, you two.
Okay, start over there.
Work your way back here, okay?
Thanks, Juan.
You got it.
Yeah, no worries.
Hi.
Hi.
Well, something tells me you two aren't here looking to pick up some unskilled labor.
No, no, we are both extremely skilled.
I'm very skilled.
FBI-skilled, pal.
You're looking to see if I'm hiring illegals?
Because I'm not.
These are all people who lost their jobs, you know-- legal citizens.
Tough times.
Some days, I think
I'm going to get mobbed for minimum wage work, man.
Under my administration, the private sector will receive incentives to increase hiring.
Bones, let's just...
no campaigning while we're doing the investigation, okay?
Okay.
We think that one of your minimum wage workers might have been killed.
Wow, man.
Who?
I don't know.
You missing anyone?
It's a pretty fluid bunch.
I'm their last resort, you know.
Do you recognize any of these men?
Uh...
That one could be Jared.
Jared...?
Jared... uh, Andrews.
No, no, um...
Jared Drew.
Jared Drew.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, what can you tell us about Mr. Drew?
He's been coming around for a year or so.
Good worker.
Never complained, always looking for more.
Sometimes intense competition for limited resources results in violence.
What?
What she means is minimum wage workers...
I mean, any of them likely to go after the competition?
Wait, wait-- Jared was murdered?
Yeah.
Wow.
Uh...
I don't know.
I mean, uh, maybe.
Yeah, thing is, I don't really get to know these guys.
Because they are below you on the social scale.
No.
Wait a second there.
I feel bad sending them away.
I get to know them as people, that's why I feel bad.
I mean, look at them.
I only have work for two.
What about all the other guys?
The victim's name is Jared Drew.
He was a day laborer.
- He used to have his own business?
- Yeah, owned a hardware store.
Wow.
He lost everything in the crash.
Suddenly he's competing for minimum wage, unskilled jobs.
Bones and I just got back from the fairgrounds.
You should have seen this.
There were 20 workers raising their hands for two jobs to pick trash-- garbage.
Does Dr. Brennan have a plan for the economy?
Okay, Sweets, let's not encourage her.
I don't know.
You know, she's very smart.
Maybe she's exactly what this country needs.
Oh, yeah, 'cause she was wanted for murder, she took peyote with the Indians, and her dad was a hard-core criminal.
I don't think I should start printing up
"Bones for President"
campaign buttons any time soon.
It's Daisy.
She's smiling and looking happy.
What's the big deal?
We're moving in together.
She's, uh... she's putting together a little celebration.
Sweets, the case.
Mm-hmm.
Victim.
All right, has no criminal record, but check this out, huh?
Right there.
Restraining order filed two days before the murder by Marcy Drew?
His ex-wife.
How is your reconstruction coming, Ms. Wick?
I hope you'll be pleased, Madam President.
"Dr. Brennan" is fine.
For now.
I found arthritic markers on his knuckles and wrists that predate the gunshot wound.
It's in the nascent stages and asymmetrical.
A day laborer should present symmetrical wear to his joints.
There are over 100 types of arthritis, Ms. Wick.
I'll examine the cell structure to see what we're dealing with.
How will you deal with the CIA?
That would be a problem for me.
I can't keep a secret.
You must realize that espionage is a crucial tool for diplomacy as well as national defense.
But you wouldn't tap my phone or anything.
A campaign must be designed to persuade the electorate that the candidate is on their side.
Which means it is sometimes necessary to lie.
So my answer is... no, I would not tap your phone.
Oh.
You did an excellent job of reconstructing the skull, Ms. Wick.
I know.
And it seems as if we have cause of death-- because of me.
Chiseling shows the bullet path was through the frontal sinus and exited through the right superlateral occipital.
The entry wound and surrounding damage measure 1.828 centimeters.
That would suggest a .45-caliber bullet.
But Dr. Saroyan said that the gunshot to the hand was probably from a nine-millimeter.
Two guns.
Which means we're likely looking for two killers.
This is terrible.
I never wanted anything like this to happen to Jared.
But you did file a restraining order against him.
He was coming around all the time.
He wouldn't leave Marcy alone.
You were listed in the restraining order, as well, Mr. Young.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jared was getting aggressive.
That had to stop.
I don't think that Jared would have hurt us, Mike.
You want to take a chance like that?
Huh?
Preemptive action.
You can never go wrong with a little preemptive action.
You seem angry.
Jared was coming around all the time begging me to take him back.
Marcy's with me now.
Okay?
I'm taking care of her.
I'm taking care of the kids.
All right, Jared's life with her is over.
Certainly is now.
Was he ever violent with you or the children?
Jared?
Oh, God, no, no.
No, he was just...
He was a loser.
He upset the kids.
That hardware store was passed down from Jared's grandfather.
And-and trying to hang onto it, we lost our condo and every penny we had.
He couldn't find any work?
He tried to get on with one of the big home improvement stores, but...
He would have had to move away from the kids.
And since you and Mike here were already together...
Who told you that?
Uh, you did, just now.
Obviously, you feel guilty about leaving your husband.
Ex-husband.
He was a good man.
He was a good provider until he lost that store.
I had to think of my kids.
Right.
You know, often, though, people feel the need to get rid of whatever it is that makes them feel guilty.
No, that's not it.
Do either of you own a gun?
I would like a lawyer.
Me, too.
Not another word without a lawyer.
Dr. Saroyan, have you seen the excrement that I left on my desk?
Think before you speak, Hodgins.
Some people might not understand what you're referring to.
Oh.
That's a good point.
So, have you seen it?
Yes, I took your excrement.
I wanted to study it.
Ooh.
Now everything sounds terrible, doesn't it?
Awful.
I wasn't finished cataloguing what the animal ate.
You'll have plenty of time.
I wanted to get my hands on the ex.... evidence to see if it contained epithelial cells.
Apparently, she hit the mother lode.
The epithelial cells came from a variety of exotic animals.
So far, I've found monkey cells, cougar and digested wolf cells.
Yeah, and all the animals were at a pet expo.
Jared Drew had work there, mucking out the, uh, holding pens.
Have your bugs given you time of death yet?
Yeah, six days ago.
Oh, that was during the pet expo.
This must have been his last job.
Oh, man.
Turns out these expos aren't just for puppies and kittens anymore.
Exotic pets are a $10 billion a year industry.
You're exaggerating, right?
No, there are more pet tigers in Texas than there are in the wilds of India.
What kind of lunatic wants a wild animal as a pet?
I think "lunatic" pretty much describes who we're talking about.
I'm sorry.
I don't know him.
He worked at your pet expo.
Doing what?
Cleaning up.
Oh, I don't hire the day laborers;
the fairground does that.
What kind of people come to these things?
Oh, awful people, really.
Families, retired people.
Antique shows, they draw stolen goods.
Gun shows draw illegal weapons.
Okay, yeah, I can see where this is going.
We don't do any traffic in illegal exotics.
My pet expo is not only in compliance with every local and federal law, but it is also approved by eight animal rights organizations.
It is a family event.
No, cougars and bears are not for families.
They are legal.
The vendors breed them right here in the U.S.
Nothing illegal about it.
These animals aren't domesticated.
It is cruel to treat them as pets.
Well, some would say that it's horrible to watch a lion taking down a zebra, tearing it apart and eating it.
These animals are spared that fate.
Look, I came here to help, not to be attacked for doing something perfectly legal.
All right, simmer down, Bwana Bob.
I comply with the law.
Now, is there anything else, or do you just intend to berate me because we see the world differently?
I believe you will be very impressed when I tell you that this arthritis isn't really arthritis.
I'd be more impressed if you told me what it is instead of what it isn't.
Beginning stages of osteonecrosis.
See here?
On the ulna at the styloid process.
And here, more damage at the olecranon process.
What causes that?
Blood poisoning?
Exactly.
And when sepsis makes its way into bone, it presents as septic arthritis.
What caused the blood poisoning?
Point of entry was here.
See the linear striations on the victim's right lunate and trapezium?
Ouch.
Those cuts are pretty deep, almost like he was slashed.
Scratching the victim down to bone, and inserting the bacteria directly into the victim's bloodstream.
What kind of person doesn't go to the hospital after an injury like that?
A very poor person?
He could've gone to the emergency room.
Either he couldn't get to a hospital, or he was prevented.
Let's see if Hodgins can take some samples and figure out what slashed him.
I'm just saying that you're more important in the lab than I am.
Is this some kind of test?
I give them faces, which, more and mo is just not the way to identify victims, and then, sometimes, I show how they died.
That is very important, Angie.
God help me, if you get into that
"All boats rise in a flood" thing...
"High tide raises all boats."
Yeah.
What?
You said flood-- a flood is a natural disaster.
What?
Most boats would sink in a flood.
Tide's good, flood's bad.
Seriously?
Ask New Orleans.
I'm telling you that I'm feeling inadequate, and you're talking about boats.
I mean, it's totally...
Hey, Sweets!
Hey!
Come here.
Hey.
Save Hodgins' life.
Hey.
Uh... don't you want to finish your your fight?
Whoa, Sweets thinks we were having a fight.
Yeah, well, he clearly doesn't know what a fight is.
I gotta go.
I'm gonna go figure out how our victim's hand got slashed.
I love you.
Hey.
Sit down.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Why?
If I were a psychologist,
I'd say that you overreacted to the slightest disagreement between me and Hodgins.
Because I'm at a turning point in my own relationship.
I was gonna say that maybe you're nervous about moving in with Daisy.
No, I've... yeah, well, I'm a little nervous.
You're getting cold feet.
No!
Why would I?
It's...
It's not like we're getting married.
Moving in together is-is... you know, it's a minor commitment.
Minor.
Oh, boy.
What?
Is it possible that maybe what you're seeing as a minor commitment, Daisy is seeing as...
The beginning of a whole new life together.
Yeah.
It's like you never studied psychology at all.
Yeah.
You found something?
Yeah.
Keratin.
From a claw?
Feline.
He was slashed by a cat?
Yeah, but not the kind that you're thinking.
Don't be so sure.
DNA results from the epithelial cells you found in the victim's boot tread.
Okay, if you say tiger, then we are on the same page.
A Siberian tiger.
Wait-- a pure-bred Siberian tiger?
According to the DNA.
Does the type of tiger make a difference?
Yeah, see, buying and selling cross-bred tigers is legal... but a pure-bred Siberian tiger, I mean, that's... that's a felony.
Definitely motive for murder.
Well, it's only murder if we can find cause of death.
I found cause of death.
I should've seen this earlier.
I was a coroner in New York.
Wait-- seen what earlier?
Dr. Brennan said that the splintering showed that the bullet entered through the palm and exited through the back of the hand...
Yeah?
Shoot me.
I beg your pardon?
No-- with the marker.
Shoot me.
Um... okay, bang--
It was a defensive wound.
The bullet went through the victim's hand and then into his face.
A hollow-point bullet.
It expanded entering the hand.
That's why we thought a nine-millimeter entered his hand and a .45-caliber
entered his face.
One bullet, one gun, one shooter.
Our victim is attacked by a pure-bred Siberian tiger.
The wounds he sustained gave him blood poisoning, but he did not seek medical help-- why?
That's what I'm asking you.
Because if he tells the hospital that he was attacked by a Siberian tiger, he ends up in prison, right?
Okay, the body was found here, on the north side of the road.
The road dead-ends in this valley.
There's five farms there.
So, if the body was found on the north side of the road, he was heading out.
After delivering the tiger.
Right.
Okay, so maybe the buyer of the tiger sees the victim's wound, realizes he's gonna have to go to the hospital...
No, no, no, no, that's too risky, okay?
Buying a tiger is a felony, Sweets.
Right, right, so, maybe... the buyer offers to drive the victim to the hospital, kills him along this deserted stretch of road.
You should search those five farms for a tiger.
I don't have enough for a warrant, okay?
That's why you're here.
- I don't understand.
- I need you to put together some kind of psychological mumbo-jumbo warrant for these five farmers.
Booth, I'm a professional, okay?
I can't just make things up, so you can get a warrant.
You're not helping me.
You... you're not.
Wouldn't it make more sense if I talked to the guy that runs the pet expo?
I mean, maybe one of these farmers is known to be an animal collector.
That's a good idea.
Thank you.
You know what?
He's in the interrogation room, okay?
You have at him.
Gotta go.
You just... you just totally conned me into doing that.
Booth!
Yeah.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Well, that depends on how personal here.
Okay, um... was it a big deal for you to move in with Dr. Brennan?
What do you mean?
You know, big deal, like... getting married.
Whoa-- living together is not getting married, okay?
Getting married's a big-boy commitment.
Okay, yes, yes.
I totally agree with that.
For me.
But, for Bones, that was a... that was a huge step, you know?
Living together.
The only reason she even considered it was because she was pregnant.
Okay, so...
Dr. Brennan's the most rational human being on the planet... and, to her, moving in together...
Big deal.
Big.
Huge.
Huge.
Huge.
Breathe it out, kid.
You'll get him.
Okay.
None of these names mean anything to me.
Who-who are they?
We have reason to believe that one of them bought a Siberian tiger on the black market.
Oh, here we go again.
Mr. Neibling, the victim worked at the fairgrounds during the time of your pet exposition, all right?
He was injured by a Siberian tiger.
Maybe one of these, one of these farmers made suspicious inquiries.
10,000 people came through that expo.
We had over 200 exhibitors.
An innocent man is dead;
we're just exploring every avenue.
If he was transporting a pure-bred Siberian tiger, then he was not innocent.
Okay, but he didn't deserve to die.
I'm not sure I agree with that.
These smugglers, they don't care about the animals, and they interfere with my legitimate business.
Now, what happens if the press finds out that you're questioning me?
My reputation goes right into the toilet.
We won't leak your name to the press.
All right, well, let me take the names.
I'll ask around.
If I hear anything suspicious, I'll get back to you.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate your help.
I love farms.
Someday, Lance and I will have a farm of our own.
The pet expo guys didn't recognize any of the farmers' names.
Yeah, but what are the chances that a guy is gonna buy a Siberian tiger with his real name, anyway?
Oh!
Oh!
I could call in an anonymous tip like:
I hear roaring at night.
I was thinking more along the lines of looking at satellite photos on the Internet, and seeing if any of the farms shout "tiger!"
That is brilliant.
Okay, here they are.
Kinda grainy.
Yeah, well, this is just what the government allows us to see on the Internet.
You know they keep all the good stuff for themselves.
Could those be endangered animals?
Are blobs endangered?
Let me try a fractal enlargement program.
I'm guessing cows.
Pigs!
Which are not endangered.
Unless you factor in bacon.
Are those cages?
Yeah... they could be.
"Could be" will not get us a warrant.
Yeah, and these images haven't been updated in over a year.
What we need is our own satellite.
Oh!
We've got one!
All of Neibling's permits are up to date-- there's no citations, no violations, he even got an "A" rating from the Better Business Bureau.
Legality notwithstanding, why would someone willingly keep these animals as pets?
People who live where these creatures are indigenous, take great lengths to keep these animals away from their homes.
Look, I'm with you, man.
You want to see a wild animal, go to the zoo.
Oh...
I do not like zoos.
What do you mean?
It's a zoo.
Keeping animals captive for human entertainment is just wrong.
Come on!
Don't ruin the zoo for me.
I used to go with Pops.
I have great memories there.
I can't wait to take Christine.
No, that will not be happening.
It's educational, okay?
What, if she doesn't go to the zoo, how's she gonna learn about the animals?
The satellite system you insisted that we buy provides us with 16 animal-themed channels.
One, just for penguins.
It's not the same, okay?
The TV won't give you a balloon.
The balloons end up in the ocean, and very often choke seals.
Okay, all right, you know what?
Find something bad to say about the kitty train they have.
Burns fossil fuels just to go round and round in circles.
Cotton candy.
Encourages Type 2 diabetes.
I could do this all day, Booth.
Fine, fine.
Just know that someday, we are getting a dog for Christine.
Hm.
Possibly.
Studies have shown that children who grow up with dogs have stronger immune systems.
And you can play ball with them.
If you say so.
I do say so.
And you know what?
We're gonna name him Gretzky.
Well, we'll see about that.
Yeah, it's Gretzky.
Here, Gretzky!
Gretzky boy!
Come on, boy!
Gretzky!
I am using a World War II Spitfire, so...
I don't have a lot of range.
And I thought you didn't have a lot of range 'cause you're using a toy.
A hobbyist does not play with toys, he works with replicas.
All right, so, you getting the signal?
Yeah, yeah, and I like the replica, sweetie.
It's awesome.
Fine.
I'm the bad guy.
All right, here we go.
Ooh, we're getting a good signal.
A goat... more pigs... lots of cows...
Try to limit the play-by-play to the exotic animals, Ms. Wick.
Well, I grew up in the city, so they're all exotic to me.
Can you get any higher?
It's a Spitfire.
Cages!
Can you get up under those trees?
Uh-huh...
What are those?
A camel!
Zebra!
Is that a wolf?
A kangaroo!
You know, Booth can tell a judge that we got this video from a hobbyist.
This is definitely enough to get us a warrant.
Oh, no, no, no...!
Ooh!
Aw...!
Aw.
Thomas Casey, FBI!
Casey, open up!
We have a warrant!
Booth, the cages are over here but...
I don't see a tiger.
Bones, wait up.
Bones!
There's a wolf, a kangaroo, a zebra...
All legal, Bones.
The state doesn't even require them to be registered.
Really?
You have to register for a dog but not a wolf?
It's horrible, Booth.
None of these animals should be kept like this.
If only you were president, Bones.
Hey!
If only.
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?
You can't be here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there, okay?
FBI.
We have a warrant.
For what?
I haven't done anything wrong.
What about these animals?
They're not meant to be kept as pets.
Hey, all these animals are legal.
Well, we're here about your Siberian tiger.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You see a tiger?
Because I don't.
What I see is an empty cage over there.
You waiting for something?
I hope I can find a chimp.
Chimp?
Oh, my God.
What?
Carrion birds.
What?
That's bad.
Go.
Go!
Go!
Go!
You shot it!
You killed it!
I had to; it was out of control, trying to get out and go for the other animals.
Whoa, easy.
You shot your own tiger?
How could...
How could he do that?
How could you do that?
!
Easy, easy!
Relax.
All right, easy, easy, easy, easy.
Okay, it's all right.
It's gonna be okay, Bones.
Don't worry about it.
What I want to know is how many things we can charge him with.
Well, we got him killing an endangered species.
Does that carry the death penalty?
$50,000 fine, a year in jail.
When I am president, killing tigers will be a death penalty offense.
Well, the president isn't actually a dictator, Bones.
That's right.
I'll have to convince two other branches of the government to execute animal traffickers.
You know what, you're very persuasive when you set your mind to something.
That animal was beautiful.
It was beautiful and rare, just like you.
You should leverage the tiger buyer into ratting out whoever he bought the tiger from.
Sorry, did you hear what I said?
It was very sweet.
Maybe we can bring down the entire criminal organization.
Right, let's do that.
Let's bring them all down.
I shot that tiger in self-defense.
It was a man-killer.
You're lying.
We are charging you with murder.
For the tiger?
!
No, for Jared Drew.
Who is Jared Drew?
He's the poor bastard who delivered the tiger to your farm.
He's dead?
Yes, he's dead.
That guy was really sick.
He could barely stand up.
He probably died of whatever disease he had.
We think that you offered to drive him to the hospital.
Killed him on the way.
And then buried him at the side of the road.
I didn't drive him anywhere.
He was too sick to drive himself.
You said it yourself.
He didn't have to drive himself.
There was the other guy.
Other guy?
What other guy?
Two of them brought me the tiger.
What did the other one look like?
I don't know.
He waited in the truck.
I never got a good look.
Yeah, well, we're still charging you with murder.
But I didn't kill anyone.
Yeah, but purchasing that tiger and transporting it over a state line, that's a felony.
Someone dies in the commission of that felony, everyone involved is guilty of homicide, pal.
Right there, that's why, when I'm president, you get appointed to head up the FBI.
There we go.
Thank you.
Who was the man in the truck?
I don't know.
I'll tell you everything
I do know.
You write down that I cooperated.
Sure, go ahead.
I'm looking online for cool animals for my collection, five clicks later, there's somebody wants to sell a Siberian tiger.
You bought it online?
"Siberian tiger available.
Serious inquiries only."
No names.
Just a e-mail telling me to meet a guy named Juan at the fairground, give him half the money in an envelope.
I only took an envelope from the guy.
I didn't even know what was inside.
Come on, Juan.
You know what an envelope full of cash feels like.
You took the money and then delivered a tiger.
A tiger?
The money was for a tiger?
The envelope full of cash, who did you give it to?
Mr. Neibling.
Eric Neibling?
I don't know his first name, man.
It's Mr. Neibling, the boss.
I give him the envelope, he gives me 50 bucks.
He asks me to send him a good worker, he gives me another $50.
You sent him Jared Drew.
Poor guy, man.
All he wanted was to make enough money and hold his head high with his wife and kids.
You know what, this makes complete sense to me now.
You saw the buyer's name on the list that we gave you.
So what do you do?
You call him up, you say, "Quick, get rid of the tiger."
Show me the phone records you've got to prove that.
I thought so.
Something wrong with you?
You need a glass of water?
I got a stomach bug or something.
He's sick.
What you have is nascent osteonecrotic septicemia.
Blood poisoning.
You got it when you shot Jared Drew in the face.
Right, from the blowback.
I got the sniffles from shooting someone?
Come on, do you know how much face time I have with the public?
He has to have a fragment of the victim's bone somewhere in him.
How big?
A sliver, probably in his face.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna leave.
Whoa, you're not going anywhere.
His face looks fine to me.
Sit down.
Sit.
Where else does blowback hit?
Put your hands on the table.
I want a lawyer.
You're gonna need one.
Put your hands on the table.
Right-handed.
Right hand holds the gun.
If I went to the hospital and they found out about the tiger,
I would've been ruined.
Look at that, huh?
You traded in 50 grand and a year in jail for the death penalty.
Lance!
Hey.
Welcome home.
Why didn't you go in?
I thought we'd go in together.
Hi!
Hey.
Is this your place?
Yeah.
Oh, wow, it looks great.
Yeah.
We'd invite you in but...
Oh, that's okay.
We'll have a housewarming party when we're settled.
You should carry her over the threshold.
Girls love that stuff.
Oh, don't bother.
I had a lump on my head for weeks and he threw out his back.
Threshold-carrying is kind of a marriage thing, and we're not actually...
We will do it.
Lance is so strong.
Okay, well, we'll leave you to it.
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
See you guys.
Um...
I'm not doing it.
I'll wrap my arms around your neck and hang on.
It will be easy.
No, I'm...
I'm not going into the apartment.
Oh, why?
Because I-I underestimated the meaning.
Which is ironic 'cause, you know,
I'm trained to discern nuance.
Stop talking like that.
When were you thinking we'd get married?
I don't know.
A year maybe.
Sooner if I get pregnant.
You want to get married before we live together.
That's fine.
My answer is yes.
No, no, no, no.
I'm...
I'm not thinking about getting married at all.
But we're moving in together.
Um, I misconstrued the significance.
I got it all wrong.
I'm so sorry.
Um...
First month's rent and last month's rent is paid.
So you have two months to figure out what you want to do.
We're not moving in together?
We're breaking up.
I'm...
I'm really sorry.
I really am.
Caroline offered to drop the charges to second degree murder if Neibling gave us the names of suppliers.
Good.
I hope Caroline puts all of them in little cages.
Right.
Did you know that Abraham Lincoln was a bartender?
Grover Cleveland was a hangman.
Andrew Johnson was a tailor.
Well, I'm sure you would be the smartest president.
I'm not sure.
James Garfield could simultaneously write Latin with one hand and Greek with the other.
That's just a trick.
So now you think I'd be a good president?
Um, no, I don't.
You know you're an atheist, you're not diplomatic, and you think America is an empire.
America is an empire.
