Bye-bye.
Bye!
Aaaggghhh!
'15 fire crews are present, though it's thought there's little chance 'of saving the infrastructure.'
ALARM CLOCK BUZZES
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
You could try them.
They've always got jobs.
Oh, great, the butcher's.
It might be good.
You were getting airs and graces.
I'm not joking about compensation, you've had genuine shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council, just cos the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek!
I know she is Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, you're such a liar!
I said to nail the cat-flap.
We'll get strays!
I did it weeks back.
Na... you thought about it.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
What do you do that for?
Cos I do!
I'm here cos someone blew up my job!
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
Nope, bonehead.
Bye.
You, inside, right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
He's part of the inquiry.
She deserves compensation!
Oh, we're talking millions.
I'm...
I'm in my dressing gown.
Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
..Well, anything could happen.
No.
Don't mind the mess.
Coffee?
Might as well, thanks, just milk.
We should go to the police.
Seriously.
That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you, even if it was some sort of joke...
Sad ending.
It said on the news they found a body. "Rose Tyler."
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!
He was nice.
He was a nice bloke.
Anyway, if we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying.
I want you to explain.
Maybe not.
FLAPPING SOUND What's that?
...
Have you got a cat?
No.
We did have, but we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
I told Mickey to chuck that out.
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?
It's all right, I've stopped it.
There.
See... armless!
You think?
!
Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off?
I can.
This is me, swanning off.
But that arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
Well observed.
You can't walk away!
That's not fair.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
No, I don't.
All right, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
Tell me or I'll talk.
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Sort of.
Doesn't work.
Who are you?
Told you, the Doctor.
Yeah, but Doctor what?
Just the Doctor.
The Doctor?
Hello!
Is that meant to sound impressive?
!
Sort of.
Come on then, you can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?
No!
I was just passing.
I'm a long way from home...
But what have I done wrong?
How come those plastic things come after me?
Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you.
You got in the way, that's all.
It tried to kill me!
It was after me, not you!
I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined it all!
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down.
It fixed on you cos you'd met me.
So, you're saying the entire world revolves around you?
Sort of, yeah.
You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah.
All this plastic stuff, who else knows?
No-one.
What, you're on your own?
Well, who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep and watch telly while underneath you, there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
I mean, if we're going with living plastic, and I don't believe that, how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into it.
I cut off the signal.
So, radio control?
Thought control.
You all right?
Yeah.
So... who's controlling it, then?
Long story.
What's it all for?
Shop window dummies, what's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
!
No!
Well, no!
It's not a price war.
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
Do you believe me?
No.
But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor...
Tell me.
Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid.
The first time they tell you the world's turning and you can't believe it cos it looks like everything's standing still.
..I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour.
The entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour.
I can feel it, we're falling through Space, you and me.
Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
STRANGE MACHINE-LIKE NOISE
H... hey, here's my woman!
Kit off.
Oh, shut up.
Coffee?
Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?
Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom.
Don't read my e-mails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did!
That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.
Dad!
It's one of your nutters.
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive.
Obviously.
I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's in the car, in case you kill me!
No, good point!
No murders!
Who is it?
It's to do with the Doctor, she's been reading the website.
Please come through, I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she?
This is quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it.
People might intercept.
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.
Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just the Doctor.
Always the Doctor.
The title seems to be passed from father to son, like an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive, last year.
The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original...
November 22nd 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy.
See.
Must be his father.
Going further back...
April 1912, this is a photograph of the Daniels family of Southampton, and friend...
Taken the day before they were due to go to the new world.
On the Titanic.
But for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip, and survived.
And here we are... 1883, another Doctor.
Look, the same lineage, he's identical...
This one washed up on the Sumatran coast, the night Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend, woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings the storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on then.
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... ..then God help you.
BIN ROARS
BIN BURPS But who is he?
Who d'you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.
Complete online conspiracy freak, you win!
So, what are we going to do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
Pizza!
Puh-puh-puh.
Pizza!
Or Chinese.
Pizzaaaaaaaa!
Should I try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it then, dishing out chips?
I could do A-levels.
I dunno.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school cos of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
So where did you meet this Doctor?
Oh, sorry, was I talking about me?
I reckon it started at the shop, am I right?
Was he something to do with that?
No.
Come on.
Sort of.
What was he doing there?
I'm not going on about it, really I'm not.
Cos I know it sounds daft, but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
You can trust me, sweetheart.
HIS VOICE IS ROBOTIC AT TURNS Babe, darling, sugar...
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning.
I can help you, Rose.
That's all I want, sweetheart, darling, babe, sugar sweetheart.
What are you doing that for?
Champagne.
We didn't order any.
Where's the Doctor?
Madam, your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?
I need know out how much he knows, so where is he?
Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
Look, we didn't order...
Ah, gotcha.
Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway!
Don't think that's gonna stop me.
Everyone, out, now!
Get out, get out, get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing!
Sonic screwdriver.
Use it!
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.
You can't hide in a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
It's gonna follow us.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but a head's perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where d'you want to start?
Um...
The inside's bigger than the outside.
Yes.
It's... alien.
Yep...
Are you alien?
Yes.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
It's called the Tardis, this thing.
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
Happens to the best of us.
Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh, I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend!
You pulled off his head, they copied him, and you didn't even think?
Now you're just gonna let him melt.
Melt?
!
Aw, no, no, no, NO!
What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading!
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!
Almost there, almost there...
Here we go!
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!
I lost the signal.
I got so close.
We've moved.
Does it fly?
It disappears there and reappears here.
But if we're... somewhere else, that headless thing's still on the loose.
Melted with the head.
Are you gonna witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him.
Again!
You were right.
You are alien.
If I did forget some kid called Mickey.
He's not a kid!
..It's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right?
All right?
!
Yes, it is!
If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north?
Lots of planets have a north!
..What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box, from the 1950s.
It's a disguise.
OK.
And, this, this living plastic, what's it got against us?
Nothing.
It loves you.
You've got a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins, perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted.
So.
Earth.
Dinner.
Any way of stopping it?
Antiplastic.
Antiplastic?
Antiplastic!
But first, I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
Hide what?
A transmitter.
The Consciousness is controlling all plastic, a transmitter boosts the signal.
What does it look like?
A transmitter!
Round and massive - in the middle of London.
A huge, metal, circular structure, like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing, it must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think.
Plastic.
Everywhere, every artificial thing waiting to be alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires, cables.
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.
Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach.
Oh, my God.
Mickey!
It's me!
It's OK.
It's all right.
Shhh.
That thing, down there...
The liquid, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
Yeah, that was always a possibility - keep him alive to maintain the copy.
You knew that and never said?
!
Can we keep domestics outside, thank you!
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp, shunt technology.
So, may I suggest, with greatest respect, that you shunt off?
!
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I AM TALKING!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid, little people have just learnt how to walk.
They are capable of so much more.
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go.
Doctor!
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy, I swear.
What do you mean?
No!
Honestly, no...
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true!
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.
What's it doing?
It's the Tardis.
The Nestene's identified it as superior technology.
It's terrified!
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion...
Get out, Rose!
Just leg it!
Mum?
Oh, there you are.
I was gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation.
I've got this document thing off the police.
Don't thank me!
Where are you, Mum?
I'm in town.
Look, go!
Just go home right now.
Darling, you're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit shopping.
I'll see you later, ta-ra.
Mum?
Mum?
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
My God!
I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I've read.
All those stories, it's all true.
Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
RUN!
The stairs have gone.
I haven't got a key...
We're gonna die!
Leave him!
There's nothing you can do!
I've got no A-levels, no job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I have got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s gymnastic team.
I got the bronze!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose, don't go out of the house!
'Lt's not safe.
There are these things, they were shooting and... '
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
You were useless!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I would.
..Thank you.
Right, then!
I'll be off.
Unless...
I dunno.
You could come with me.
This box isn't just a London hopper, you know.
It goes anywhere in the universe.
Free of charge.
Don't!
He's an alien, he's a thing.
He's not invited.
What d'you think?
You could... stay here.
Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go... anywhere.
Is it always this dangerous?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump.
So...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
Thanks.
Thanks for what?
Exactly.
This is the year five billion, and this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
Ooh, I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler.
She's my plus one, is that all right?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
That's not supposed to happen.
Subtitles by Leanne Matheson, BBC Broadcast 2005
- Bye!
- See you later.
Bye!
The store will be closing in five minutes.
Thank you.
Hey!
Wilson?
Wilson, I've got the lottery money.
Wilson.
Are you there?
I can't hang about 'cause they're closing the shop.
Wilson!
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Hello, Wilson.
It's Rose.
Hello?
Wil...
Wilson?
Wilson?
Wilson!
You're kidding me!
Is that someone mucking about?
Who is it?
You got me.
Very funny
Right, I've got the joke.
Whose idea was this?
Is it Derek's?
Is it?
Derek, is this you?
Run!
- You pulled his arm off!
- Yep.
Plastic.
Nice trick.
Who were they?
- Is it a student thing?
- Why would they be students?
- I don't know.
- You said it.
Why students?
That many people dressed up and being silly.
They gotta be students.
That makes sense.
Well done.
- Thanks.
- They're not students.
Wilson will call the police.
- Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
Wilson's dead.
- That's not funny.
That's sick.
- Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this now.
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there?
I said who are they?
They're living plastic creatures.
They're controlled by a relay device on the roof, which would be a problem if I didn't have this.
I'm going to blow it up, and I might well die in the process, but don't worry about me - go home and have your beans on toast.
If you tell anyone about this, you'll get them killed.
- I'm the Doctor.
You are?
- Rose.
Nice to meet you, Rose.
Run for your life!
Watch it!
Police investigate a fire in Central London.
I know.
It's on the telly.
It's everywhere.
She's lucky to be alive!
It's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.
You'd think I was HER daughter.
Here's himself.
I've been phoning your mobile.
You could have been dead.
I can't believe the shop went up!
I'm fine.
Don't make a fuss.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- What caused it?
- I wasn't in the shop.
I didn't see anything.
Debbie knows a man on the "Mirror".
500 quid for an interview.
Brilliant.
Give it here.
You've got to find some way of making money.
I'm not bailing you out.
Bev!
She's alive!
I've told her.
Sue for compensation.
She was within seconds of death!
- Is that tea?
You need something stronger.
- I'm all right.
You deserve a proper drink.
- Let's go down the pub.
- Is there a match on?
- No!
I'm just thinking about you.
- There's a match on.
- We could catch the last five minutes.
- Go on, then.
I'm fine.
Go.
Get rid of that.
- Bye!
- Bye.
It's thought there's very little chance of saving the infrastructure.
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've got no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
- They've always got jobs.
- Oh, great.
The butcher's
It might do you good.
That shop gave you airs and graces.
I mean it about compensation.
You've had shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council 'cause the old man at the desk said she looked Greek.
She IS Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, I told you to nail that cat flap down.
We're gonna get strays.
- I did it weeks back!
- You thought about it.
What are you doing here?
- I live here.
- What for?
'Cause I do.
I'm only here 'cause someone blew up my job.
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
No, bonehead.
Bye, then.
Inside.
Right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
Give us ten minutes.
She deserves compensation.
Oh, we're talking millions!
Um...
- I'm in my dressing gown.
- Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
Well, anything could happen.
No.
- Don't mind the mess.
Do you want a coffee?
- Might as well, thanks.
Just milk.
- We should go to the police.
Seriously.
- That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you.
- Even if it was a joke that went wrong.
- Hmm.
Sad ending.
- It said on the news they found a body.
- "Rose Tyler."
Ah!
Could have been worse.
Look at the ears!
- He was a nice bloke.
- Luck be a lady...
If we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying.
I want you to explain everything.
Maybe not!
What's that, then?
- Have you got a cat?
- No.
We did have, but now we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
- I told Mickey to chuck that out.
- You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?
Agh!
I've stopped it.
See?
- 'Armless
- Do you think?
- You can't just go swanning off!
- Yes, I can.
This is me swanning off.
- That arm tried to kill me!
- Well observed.
You can't just walk away.
- You've got to tell me what's going on.
- No, I don't.
All right.
I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said if I did that, I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
- Tell me or I'll start talking.
- Is that supposed to sound tough?
- Sort of.
- It doesn't work.
- Who are you?
- Told you.
The Doctor.
- Doctor what?
- Just the Doctor.
- The Doctor?
- Hello!
- Is that supposed to sound impressive?
- Sort of.
Come on.
You can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?

Why are those plastic things after me?

That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
- Hey-hey!
Here's my woman.
Kit off!
- Shut up.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
- Not rinse, wash.
Can I use your computer?
- Yeah.
Any excuse to get in the bedroom!
Don't read my emails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe.
He's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did.
That's exactly what an internet murderer would say!
Hello.
I've come to see Clive.
We've been emailing.
Dad!
One of your nutters!
Oh, sorry.
Hello.
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive, obviously.
My boyfriend's waiting in the car - just in case you're gonna kill me
Good point.
No murders!
- Who is it?
- It's to do with the Doctor.
She's been reading the website.
Come through.
I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read the website about the Doctor and she's a she?
A lot of this stuff's quite sensitive.
I couldn't just send it to you.
People might intercept it.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor crops up all over the place - political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just "the Doctor" - always "the Doctor".

This was taken the day before they were due to sail on the Titanic.
For some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip and survived.
Here we are... 1883.
Another Doctor.
Look - the same lineage.
It's identical.
This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra the night that Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings a storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, then one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on, then!
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... then God help you!
Agh!
Who is he?
Who do you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter!
Off his head.
A complete online conspiracy freak.
You win.
What are we gonna do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
- Pizza!
Puh-puh-pizza!
- Or a Chinese.
Pizza!
Do you think I should try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it, then - dishing out chips?
I could do A levels.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school 'cause of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
- Where did you meet this Doctor?
- Sorry.
Did I talk about me then
It started at the shop, right?
Was he something to do with that?
- No.
- Come on.
Sort of.
- What was he doing there?
- I'm not going on about it, Mickey.
I'm not.
I know it sounds daft but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
- You can trust me, sweetheart.
- Babe.
Sugar.
Tell me what the Doctor's planning and I can help you, Rose.
- That's all I really want to do, sweetheart.
- Babe.
Sugar.
Sweetheart.
What are you doing?
- Your champagne.
- We didn't order it.
- Where's the Doctor?
- Your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what's wrong?
I need to find out how much he knows.
- Don't you want champagne?
- We didn't order it.
- Ah!
Gotcha!
- Don't mind me.
Just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway...
That's not gonna stop me.
Everyone out now!
Get out!
Get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing.
- Sonic screwdriver.
- Use it!
Nah.
Let's go in here.
You can't hide inside a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
He's gonna follow us!
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried.
You see, the arm was too simple, but the head is perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where do you want to start?
The inside is bigger than the outside.
- Yes.
- It's alien.
Yep.
Are you alien?
Yes.
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.
It's called the Tardis.
T-A-R-D-l-S.
Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
- Happens to the best of us.
- Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh.
I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend.
You pulled off his head.
They copied him and you didn't even think?
- And now you're just gonna let him melt?
- Melt?
- No, no, no!
- What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading.
No, no!
Almost there.
Here we go.
You can't go out there.
It's not safe.
I lost the signal.
I got so close!
- We've moved.
Does it fly?
- Disappears there and reappears here.
What about that headless thing?
It's still on the loose.
- It melted with the head.
Stop wittering on.
- I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead.
You forgot him again!
- You were right.
You ARE alien.
- If I did forget some kid, it's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape on this planet, all right?
- All right.
- Yes, it is!
- Why do you sound like you're from the north?
- Lots of planets have a north.
What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box from the 1950s.
- It's a disguise.
- OK.
- This living plastic, what's it got against us?
- Nothing.
It loves you.
You have a great planet.
Lots of smoke and oil, toxins and dioxins in the air.
Perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed.
- Its protein planets rotted, so Earth - dinner!
- Can you stop it?
- Antiplastic.
- Antiplastic?
First I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big?
- What?
- The transmitter.
The Consciousness controls the plastic.
The transmitter boosts the signal.
- What does it look like?
- Like a transmitter.
Round and massive.
Slap bang in the middle of London.
A huge metal circular structure.
Like a wheel.
Close to where we're standing.
Must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think of it - plastic all over the world.
Everything coming alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires.
- The cables...
- The breast implants.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it inside the vat.
A living plastic creature.
- Tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
- I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with you under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach?
Oh, God!
Mickey, it's me.
It's OK.
It's all right.
That thing down there - the liquid, Rose - it can talk!
You're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
That was always a possibility.
That way, they maintain the copy.
- You knew that and never said?
- Can we keep the domestics outside?
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
You infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp-shunt technology, so may I respectfully suggest that you shunt off?
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I am talking!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid people have only just learnt to walk, but they're capable of so much more.
- I'm asking you on their behalf.
Please go.
- Doctor!
It was just insurance.
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy.
I swear I'm not.
What do you mean?
No!
Honestly, no!
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true.
I should know.
I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world or any of them.
What's it doing?
The Nestene's identified the Tardis as superior technology.
It's terrified.
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion.
Get out, Rose.
Just leg it now!
- Mum?
- There you are.
I was just gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation.
I've got this document off the police.
Don't thank me.
- Where are you, Mum?
- I'm in town.
- Just go home right now.
- You're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit of late-night shopping.
See you later.
Ta-ra!
Mum?
Mum!
It's the activation signal.
It's transmitting!
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
God!
I thought they were dummies.
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I read - all the stories - it's all true.
- Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
Run!
- The stairs have gone!
I haven't got the key!
We're gonna die.
Agh!
Agh!
- No!
- Time Lord!
Just leave him!
- There's nothing you can do!
- I've got no A levels.
No job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I HAVE got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s Gymnastics Team.
I've got the bronze.
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose!
Don't go out of the house.
It's not safe.
These things were shooting...
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
- Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
- You were useless in there.
- You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
- Yes, I would.
Thank you.
Right, then, I'll be off... unless...
I don't know...
You could come with me.
This box goes anywhere in the universe free of charge.
Don't.
He's an alien.
He's a thing!
He's not invited.
What do you think?
You could stay here, fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go anywhere.
- Is it always this dangerous?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum, and someone's got to look after this stupid lump, so...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
- Thanks.
- Thanks for what?
Exactly!
This is the year five billion.
And this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor.
This is Rose Tyler, my "plus one", OK?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have trees.
The Moxx of Balhoon.
The Face of Boe.
The last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare!
Look how thin I am!
That's not supposed to happen.
Run.
- I'm the Doctor.
- I'm Rose.
Nice to meet you.
Run!
It's following us!
Genghis Khan couldn't get in here and he's tried.
- Are you alien?
- Yes.
Come with me.
- Is it always dangerous?
- Yeah.
Right, Rose Tyler, do you want to go backwards or forwards in time?
- It's your choice.
What's it going to be?
- Forwards.
- How far?
- 100 years.
- Step outside.
It's the 22nd century.
- You're kidding?
- Do you want to go further?
- Fine by me.
10,000 years in the future.
Step outside.
It's 12005.
The new Roman Empire.
- You think you're so impressive.
- I am.
- You wish!
- You asked for it.
I know where to go.
Hold on.
Where are we?
What's out there?
You lot spend all your time thinking about dying - like you're going to get killed by eggs or beef or global warming or asteroids.
You never take time to imagine the impossible - that you'll survive.
This is the year 5.5/Apple/26.
Five billion years in your future.
And this is the day...
Hold on.
This is the day the Sun expands.
Welcome to the end of the world.
Shuttles Five and Six now docking.
Guests are reminded that Platform One forbids the use of weapons, teleportation and religion.
Earth death is scheduled for 15.39, followed by drinks in the Manchester Suite.
- "Guests"?
Does that mean people?
- Depends what you mean by people.
- I mean people.
What do you mean?
- Aliens.
What are they doing on board this spaceship?
It's more an observation deck.
The great and the good are going to watch the planet burn.
- What for?
- Fun.
When I say "the great and the good", I mean the rich.
But they did this on "Newsround Extra" - the sun expanding.
It takes hundreds of years.
The planet belongs to the National Trust.
They've been preserving it.
See there?
Gravity satellites holding back the sun.
The planet looks the same.
I thought the continents shifted.
They did and the Trust shifted them back.
That's a classic Earth.
Now the money's run out, nature takes over.
- How long's it got?
- About half an hour.
Then it gets roasted.
Is that why we're here?
Do you jump in at the last minute and save the Earth?
- I'm not saving it.
Time's up.
- What about the people?
It's empty.
They've all gone.
No one left.
- Just me, then.
- Who the hell are you?
- That's nice.
Thanks.
- How did you get in?
This is a maximum hospitality zone.
The guests have disembarked.
That's me.
I'm a guest.
I've got an invitation.
Look.
It's fine.
"The Doctor plus one." I'm the Doctor and this is Rose Tyler.
All right?
Well... obviously.
Apologies, etcetera.
If you're on board, we'd better start.
Enjoy.
The paper's psychic.
It shows them what I want them to see.
- Saves a lot of time.
- He's blue.
- Yeah.
- OK.
We have in attendance the Doctor and Rose Tyler.
Thank you.
All staff to their positions.
Hurry, now.
Quick as we can.
Come along, come along.
Might I introduce the next honoured guest?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have trees, namely Jabe, Lute and Coffa.
There will be an exchange of gifts representing peace.
Keep the room circulating.
Next, from the solicitors Jolco and Jolco, we have the Moxx of Balhoon.
And next, from Financial Family Seven, we have the Adherents of the Repeated Mean...
The inventors of Hypo-Slip Travel Systems, the brothers Hop Pyleen...
Cal Spark Plug...
Mr and Mrs Pacoon...
Ambassadors from the city state of Binding Light...
The gift of peace.
I bring you a cutting of my grandfather.
Thank you.
Yes.
Gifts...
I give you in return... air from my lungs.
How... intimate.
- There's more where that came from.
- I bet there is.
From the Silver Devastation, the sponsor of the main event, please welcome the Face of Boe.
The Moxx of Balhoon.
My felicitations upon this historical happenstance.
I bring you the gift of bodily salivas.
Thank you.
Ah, the Adherents of the Repeated Mean.
I bring you air from my lungs.
A gift of peace in all good faith.
Last, but not least, our very special guest.
Ladies and gentlemen and trees and multiforms... consider the Earth below.
In memory of this dying world, we call forth the last human.
The lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Delta 17.
Now, don't stare.
I know.
I know, it's shocking, isn't it?
I've had my chin completely taken away and look at the difference.
Look how thin I am.
Thin and dainty.
I don't look a day over 2,000.
Moisturise me.
Moisturise me.
Truly I am the last human.
My father was a Texan, my mother was from the Arctic desert.
They were born on the Earth and they were the last to be buried in its soil.
I have come to honour them and to say goodbye.
No tears.
No tears...
I'm sorry.
But behold, I bring gifts.
From Earth itself, the last remaining ostrich egg.
Legend says it had a wingspan of 50 feet and blew fire from its nostrils.
Or was that my third husband?
No, don't laugh.
I'll get laughter lines.
And here, another rarity.
According to the archives, this was called an iPod.
It stores classical music from humanity's greatest composers.
Play on.
Refreshments are served.
Earth death in 30 minutes.
Sometimes I feel I've got to... run away
I've got to... get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night...
Doctor?
Thank you.
A gift of peace in all good faith.
- You're kind, but I'm just the steward.
- A gift of peace in all good faith.
Well, yes.
Thank you.
Of course.
Identify species.
Please identify species.
Stop it.
Identify his race.
Where's he from?
It's impossible.
Sorry.
Am I allowed to be in here?
You have to give us permission to talk.
Er...
You have permission.
Thank you.
And no, you're not in the way.
Guests are allowed anywhere.
OK.
- What's your name?
- Raffalo.
Raffalo?
Yes, miss.
I won't be long.
I've just got to carry out some maintenance.
There's a glitch in the Face of Boe's suite.
There must be something blocking the system.
He's not getting hot water.
- So you're a plumber?
- That's right, miss.
- You still have plumbers?
- Else I'm out of a job.
- Where are you from?
- Crespallion.
- That's a planet, isn't it?
- No.
It's part of the Jaggit Brocade, affiliated to the Scarlet Junction.
Convex 56.
Where are you from, miss?
If you don't mind me asking.
No, not at all.
Um...
I don't know.
A long way away.
I just sort of hitched a lift with this man.
I didn't even think about it.
I don't even know who he is.
He's a complete stranger.
Anyway, don't let me keep you.
Good luck with it.
Thank you, miss, and er...
Thank you for the permission.
Not many people are that considerate.
OK.
See you later.
Now, then...
Control, I'm at Junction 19.
I think the problem's here.
I'll go in and have a look.
What's that?
Is something in there?
Who are you, then?
Hold on!
If you're an upgrade, I just need to register you.
Come back.
There you are.
I need to register your ident.
Oh, there's two of you.
Got yourself a little mate.
I think I'd better report this to Control.
How many of you are there?
What are you?
No, please...
No!
No!
What's that?
How should I know?
Would the owner of the blue box in Gallery 15 please report to the Steward's office?
Guests are reminded that the use of teleportation devices is strictly forbidden under peace treaty 5.4/Cup/16.
Thank you.
- Earth death in 25 minutes.
- Earth death in 25 minutes.
Oh, thanks.
Hello.
My name's Rose.
That's a sort of plant.
We might be related.
I'm talking to a twig.
Careful with that.
Park it properly.
No scratches.
Rose?
Are you in there?
Aye, aye.
- What do you think, then?
- Great.
Yeah.
Fine.
Once you get past the slightly psychic paper.
They're just so alien.
The aliens are so alien.
You look at 'em and they're alien.
Good thing I didn't take you to the Deep South.
- Where are you from?
- All over the place.
- They all speak English.
- No.
You hear English.
It's the Tardis.
The telepathic field gets into your brain and translates.
- It's inside my brain?
- In a good way.
Your machine gets inside my head and changes my mind and you didn't even ask?
- I didn't think of it.
- No.
You were too busy thinking up cheap shots about the Deep South!
Who are you, then, Doctor?
What sort of alien are you?
- I'm just the Doctor.
- From what planet?
- You wouldn't know it.
- Where are you from?
- Why?
- Tell me who you are.
This is who I am, right here and now.
All that counts is here and now and this is me!
And I'm here too 'cause you brought me!
So just tell me!
Earth death in 20 minutes.
Earth death in 20 minutes.
All right.
As my mate Shereen says, "Don't argue with the designated driver."
Can't exactly call for a taxi.
There's no signal.
We're out of range.
Just a bit.
- With a bit of jiggery-pokery...
- Is that a technical term?
- Yeah.
I came first in jiggery-pokery.
You?
- No.
I failed hullabaloo.
There you go.
Hello?
- Mum?
- What is it?
What have I done now?
This red top's falling to bits.
You should get your money back.
You never phone in the middle of the day.
What's so funny?
- Nothing.
You all right?
- Yeah.
Why wouldn't I be?
- What day is it?
- Wednesday.
All day.
You got a hangover?
Put a quid in that Lottery syndicate.
I'll pay you back later.
Yeah.
I was just calling 'cause I might be late home.
- Is there something wrong?
- No.
I'm fine.
Top of the world.
Think that's amazing, you want to see the bill.
That was five billion years ago.
So...
She's dead now.
- Five billion years later, my mum's dead.
- Bundle of laughs, you are.
That's not supposed to happen.
What was it?
I'm just getting green lights at this end.
Guests may be reassured that gravity pockets may cause slight turbulence.
The whole place shook!
I felt it.
I've hosted events on Platforms One, Three, Six and 15 and I've never felt a tremor.
If this lot decide to sue...
I'm going to scan the infrastructure.
What's that?
Control, I don't want to worry you, but I'm picking up readings...
I have no idea.
They're small.
The scan says they're metal.
I don't know what they look like!
Although I imagine they might look rather like that.
You're not on the guest list.
How did you get on board?
No!
- Sun filter deactivated.
- No!
Sun filter descending.
- Sun filter up!
- External temperature 4,000 degrees.
- Control, respond!
Sun filter up!
- Sun filter descending.
Indubitably, this is the bad-move scenario.
I find the inherent laxity of the ongoing...
That wasn't a gravity pocket.
They don't feel like that.
What do you think, Jabe?
Listen to the engines.
They've pitched up about 30 hertz.
It's the sound of metal.
It doesn't make sense to me.
- Where's the engine room?
- I don't know.
The maintenance duct is behind our suite.
I could show you and... your wife.
She's not my wife.
- Partner?
- No.
- Concubine?
- No.
- Prostitute?
- Whatever I am, it must be invisible!
You two go and pollinate.
I'll catch up with the family.
Word with Michael Jackson.
Don't start a fight.
I'm all yours.
And I want you home by midnight.
- Earth death in 15 minutes.
- Earth death in 15 minutes.
Who's in charge of Platform One?
Is there a captain?
Just the steward and the staff.
The rest is controlled by the metal mind.
The computer?
Who controls that?
The corporation.
They move Platform One from one artistic event to another.
But no one from the corporation is on board?
They're not needed.
This facility is purely automatic.
- Nothing can go wrong.
- Unsinkable?
If you like.
The nautical metaphor is appropriate.
I was on board another ship they said was unsinkable.
I ended up clinging to an iceberg.
So if we get in trouble, there's no one to help us out?
- I'm afraid not.
- Fantastic.
I don't understand.
In what way is that fantastic?
Soon the Sun will blossom into a red giant and my home will die.
That's where I used to live when I was a little boy.
Mummy and Daddy had a house built into the side of the Los Angeles crevasse.
I'd have such fun.
What happened to the human race?
Where did it go?
They say mankind has touched every star in the sky.
- So you're not the last human?
- I am the last pure human.
The others mingled.
They call themselves new humans, proto-humans, digi-humans, even human-ish, but do you know what I call them?
Mongrels.
Right.
And you stayed behind.
I kept myself pure.
How many operations have you had?
708.
Next week it's 709.
I'm having my blood bleached.
Is that why you wanted a word?
You could be flatter.
- You've got a bit of a chin poking out.
- I'd rather die.
- It doesn't hurt.
- No, I mean it.
I would rather die.
It's better to die than live like you - a bitchy trampoline.
What do you know?
I was born on that planet and so was my mum and dad and that makes me the last human being.
You're not human.
You've had it all flattened until there's nothing left.
Anything human got chucked in the bin.
You're just skin.
Lipstick and skin.
Nice talking.
So, Jabe, what's a tree like you doing in a place like this?
- Respect for the Earth.
- Come on.
Everyone here's worth zillions.
Perhaps it's having to be seen at the right occasions.
In case your shares drop?
You've got massive forests everywhere.
There's always money in land.
All the same, we respect the Earth as family.
So many species evolved from that planet.
Mankind is only one.
I'm another.
My ancestors were transplanted from the planet down below.
I'm a direct descendant of the tropical rainforest.
Excuse me.
What about your ancestry?
Perhaps you could tell a story or two.
Perhaps a man only enjoys trouble when there's nothing else left.
I scanned you earlier.
The metal machine had trouble identifying your species and even when it named you, I wouldn't believe it.
But it was right.
I know where you're from.
Forgive me for intruding but it's remarkable that you even exist.
I just wanted to say how sorry I am.
Is it me or is it a bit nippy?
That's a great bit of air conditioning.
Nice and old-fashioned.
I bet they call it retro.
Gotcha.
- What the hell's that?
- Is it part of the retro?
I don't think so.
Hold on.
- Hey, nice liana.
- Thanks.
I shouldn't show them in public.
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.
Who's been bringing their pets on board?
- What does it do?
- Sabotage.
- Earth death in ten minutes.
- The temperature's about to rocket.
- The planet's end.
- Come gather!
Come gather!
Bid farewell to the cradle of civilisation.
Let us mourn her with a traditional ballad.
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling...
Hold on.
Get back.
- Sun filter rising.
Sun filter rising.
- Is the steward in there?
You can smell him.
There's another sun filter programmed to descend.
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Do you feel me now...
- Sun filter descending.
- Sun filter descending.
- Sun filter descending.
- Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
- Let me out!
- Sun filter descending.
Sun filter descending.
- Anyone in there?
- Let me out!
- It would be you.
- Open the door!
- Give us two ticks.
- Sun filter descending.
Sun filter descending.
Sun filter rising.
Sun filter rising.
Sun filter rising.
Sun filter rising.
- Sun filter descending.
- The computer's getting clever.
- Stop mucking about!
- I'm not.
It's fighting back.
- Open the door!
- I know!
The lock's melted!
Sun filter descending.
Sun filter descending.
Sun filter rising.
Sun filter rising.
- The whole thing's jammed.
Stay there.
- Where am I going to go, Ipswich?
Earth death in five minutes.
The metal machine confirms - the spiders have infiltrated the whole of Platform One.
How is that possible?
Our rooms are protected by a code wall.
Moisturise me.
- Summon the steward.
- I'm afraid the steward is dead.
Who killed him?
This event was sponsored by the Face of Boe.
He invited us.
Talk to the Face!
Someone brought their pet on board.
Let's send him back to master.
The Adherents of the Repeated Mean.
J'accuse!
That's all very well and obvious, but if you think about it...
A repeated mean is just an idea and that's all they are - an idea.
Remote-controlled droids.
Cover for the real troublemaker.
Go on, Jimbo.
Go home.
I bet you were the school swot and never got kissed.
- At arms!
- Are you going to moisturise me?
With acid.
You're too late anyway.
My spiders have control of the mainframe.
You all carried them as gifts, tax-free, past every code wall.
I'm not just a pretty face.
Sabotaging a ship you're on?
How stupid's that?
I'd hoped to manufacture a hostage situation, with myself as a victim.
- The compensation would have been huge.
- Five billion years and it's still money.
Do you think it's cheap looking like this?
Flatness costs a fortune.
I am the last human, Doctor.
Me.
Not that freaky little kid of yours.
- Arrest her.
Infidel.
- Oh, shut it, pixie!
- I've still got my final option.
- Earth death in three minutes.
And here it comes.
You're all just as useful dead.
I have shares in your rival companies.
They'll triple in price once you're dead.
My spiders are ready to destroy the safety systems.
How does that old Earth song go?
- "Burn, Baby, Burn".
- Then you'll burn with us.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I know the use of teleportation is strictly forbidden, but...
I'm so naughty.
Spiders, activate!
Force-field's gone with the planet about to explode.
At least it'll be quick.
Just like my fifth husband.
Oh, shame on me.
Bye-bye, darlings.
Bye-bye, my darlings.
Heat levels rising.
- Reset the computer.
- The steward would know how.
No.
We can do it.
There must be a system restore switch.
Jabe, come on.
You lot, just chill.
Earth death in two minutes.
Earth death in two minutes.
Heat levels critical.
Heat levels critical.
Oh.
And guess where the switch is.
Heat levels rising.
Heat levels rising.
External temperature 5,000 degrees.
You can't.
The heat will vent through here.
- I know.
- Jabe, you're made of wood.
Then stop wasting time...
Time Lord.
Heat levels rising.
Heat levels rising.
- We're going to die!
- Heat levels hazardous.
Shields malfunction.
Shields malfunction.
Shields malfunction.
Shields malfunction.
Heat levels critical.
Heat levels critical.
Heat levels rising.
Heat levels rising.
Land explodes in... ten...
Nine...
Eight...
Seven...
Six...
Five...
Four...
Raise shields!
One...
Exoglass repair.
Exoglass repair.
Exoglass repair.
Exoglass repair.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm full of ideas.
I'm bristling with them.
Idea one - teleportation through 5,000 degrees needs some kind of feed.
Idea two - this feed must be hidden nearby.
Idea three - if you're as clever as me, then a teleportation feed can be reversed.
You should have seen their little alien faces...
- Oh!
- The last human.
You passed my little test.
Bravo.
This makes you eligible to join... the Human Club.
- People have died.
You murdered them.
- It depends on your definition of people.
That should keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries.
Take me to court, Doctor, and watch me smile and cry and...
And creak?
- And what?
- Creak.
You're creaking.
What?
I'm drying out.
Sweet heavens!
Moisturise me!
Moisturise me!
Where are my surgeons?
- My lovely boys!
It's too hot.
- You raised the temperature.
Have pity!
Moisturise me!
- Oh, Doctor...
- Help her.
Everything has its time and everything dies.
I am... too... young!
Shuttles Four and Six departing.
This unit now closing down for maintenance.
The end of the Earth.
It's gone.
We were too busy saving ourselves.
No one saw it go.
All those years, all that history, and no one was even looking.
- It's just...
- Come with me.
"Big Issue".
"Big Issue".
You think it'll last for ever - people and cars and concrete.
But it won't.
One day it's all gone.
Even the sky.
My planet's gone.
It's dead.
It burned like the Earth.
It's just rocks and dust.
Before its time.
- What happened?
- There was a war and we lost.
A war with who?
What about your people?
I'm a Time Lord.
I'm the last of the Time Lords.
They're all gone.
I'm the only survivor.
I'm left travelling on my own 'cause there's no one else.
There's me.
You've seen it's dangerous.
Do you want to go home?
I don't know...
I want...
- Can you smell chips?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I want chips.
Me too.
Chips it is, and you can pay.
- No money.
- What sort of date are you?
Come on, tight-wad.
Chips are on me.
We've only got five billion years till the shops close.
Let's have a look at the past.
1860.
How does 1860 sound?
- What happened in 1860?
- Let's find out.
- I can't believe she's gone.
- Not gone, Mr Redpath.
Merely sleeping.
- She's on her feet and out there somewhere.
- For shame!
It's ungodly.
Mr Dickens, this is your call.
Use the sight.
Find the old lady or you're dismissed.
What phantasmagoria is this?
That's more like it.
Sneed And Company offer their sincerest condolences, sir, in this most trying hour.
Grandmama had a good innings, Mr Sneed.
She was so full of life.
- I can't believe she's gone.
- Not gone, Mr Redpath.
Merely sleeping.
- May I have a moment?
- Yes, of course.
I shall be in the next room should you need anything.
Oh, no.
Gwyneth!
Get down here now!
We've got another one!
- Hold that one down.
- I am!
- Hold them both down!
- It won't work!
I promised you a time machine.
We've seen the future.
Let's see the past.
- How does 1860 sound?
- What happened in 1860?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
Hold on.
Gwyneth!
Where are you, girl?
Gwyneth!
Where have you been?
I was shouting.
- The stables, breaking the ice for Samson.
- Go back and harness him up.
- Whatever for, sir?
- The stiffs are getting lively again.
Mr Redpath's grandmother is up and out there somewhere.
We've got to find her.
Mr Sneed, how many more times?
It's ungodly.
Don't look at me like it's my fault.
Hurry up.
She was 86.
She can't have got far.
What about Mr Redpath?
Did you deal with him?
No... she did.
That's awful, sir.
I know it's not my place and please forgive me for talking out of turn, sir, but this is getting beyond now.
Something terrible is happening here and we need to get help.
And we will... as soon as I get that dead old woman locked up.
Stop prevaricating, get the hearse ready.
We're going body-snatching.
- Blimey!
- Are you all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Nothing broken.
Did we make it?
I did it.
Give the man a medal.
Earth, Naples.
December 24th 1860.
That's so weird.
It's Christmas.
All yours.
But it's like...
Think about it, though.
Christmas 1860.
It happens once, just once, and it's gone.
It's finished.
It'll never happen again.
Except for you.
You can go back and see days that are dead and gone 100,000 sunsets ago.
- No wonder you never stay still.
- Not a bad life?
Better with two.
Come on.
- Where are you going?
- 1860.
Like that?
You'll start a riot, Barbarella.
There's a wardrobe.
First left, second right, past the bins, fifth door on your left.
Hurry up.
Not a sign.
Where is she?
She's vanished into the ether, sir.
Where can she be?
- You tell me, girl.
- What do you mean?
- Gwyneth, you know full well.
- No, sir.
I can't.
- Use the sight.
- It's not right, sir.
Find the old lady or you're dismissed.
Now...
look inside, girl.
Look deep.
Where is she?
She's lost, sir.
She's so alone.
Oh, my Lord.
So many strange things in her head.
But where?
She was excited about tonight.
- Before she passed on, she was to see him.
- Who's him?
The great man.
All the way from London.
The great, great man.
Mr Dickens?
Excuse me, sir.
This is your call.
- Are you quite well, sir?
- Splendid.
Sorry.
- Time you were on, sir.
- Absolutely.
I was just brooding.
Christmas Eve.
Not the best of times to be alone.
Did no one travel with you, sir?
No lady wife?
- Afraid not.
- You can have mine, if you want.
I wouldn't dare.
I've been rather...
let's say clumsy with family matters.
Thank God I'm too old to cause any more trouble.
- You speak as if it's all over, sir.
- No.
It's never over.
On and on I go... the same old show.
I'm like a ghost, condemned to repeat myself through all eternity.
It's never too late, sir.
You can think up some new turns.
No, I can't.
Even my imagination grows stale.
I'm an old man.
Perhaps I've thought everything I'll ever think.
Still...
The lure of the limelight's as potent as a pipe, what?
On with the motley.
- Blimey!
- Don't laugh.
You look beautiful.
- Considering.
- Considering what?
That you're human.
I think that's a compliment.
Are you changing?
- I've changed my jumper.
Come on.
- You stay there.
This is mine.
Ready for this?
Here we go.
History.
"GOD REST YE MERRY, GENTLEMEN")
- She's in there, sir.
I'm certain of it.
- Right.
- I got the flight a bit wrong.
- I don't care.
- It's not 1860, it's 1869.
- I don't care.
- And it's not Naples.
- I don't care.
It's Cardiff.
Right.
Now, it is a fact that there was nothing particular at all about the knocker on the door of this house, but let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change... not a knocker, but Marley's face.
Marley's face!
It looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look.
It looked like...
Oh, my Lord.
It looked...
like that.
What phantasmagoria is this?
That's more like it.
Stay in your seats...
I beg you.
It is a lantern show.
It's trickery.
- Excuse me.
- There she is, sir!
I can see that.
The whole blooming world can see that!
Fantastic.
- Did you see where it came from?
- Ah, the wag reveals himself.
- I trust you're satisfied, sir!
- Oi!
Leave her alone!
I'll get them!
Be careful!
Did it say anything?
Can it speak?
- I'm the Doctor.
- You look more like a navvy.
What's wrong with this jumper?
- What are you doing?
- It's a tragedy, miss.
We'll deal with it.
This poor lady's been taken with the brain fever.
She's cold.
She's dead.
What did you do to her?
- What did you do that for?
- She's seen too much.
Get her in.
Legs.
Gas.
It's made of gas.
- Rose!
- You're not escaping me, sir.
What do you know about that hobgoblin?
Projection on glass?
Who put you up to it?
Yeah, mate.
Not now.
Oi, you!
Follow that hearse!
- I can't do that, sir.
- Why not?
I'll tell you why not!
Because this is my coach.
Well, get in, then.
Move!
Yah!
Come on.
- Come on.
- Everything in order, Mr Dickens?
- No!
- What did he say?
- I am not without a sense of humour...
- Dickens?
- Yes.
- Charles Dickens?
The Charles Dickens?
- Shall I remove the gentleman, sir?
- You're brilliant!
I've read them all.
"Great Expectations", "Oliver Twist" and the one with the ghost.
- "A Christmas Carol"?
- No.
With the trains.
"The Signalman".
Terrifying.
The best short story ever.
You're a genius.
- Shall I get rid of him, sir?
- No.
He can stay.
Charles...
Can I call you Charles?
I'm such a fan.
- A what?
A big what?
- Fan.
Number one fan.
How exactly are you a fan?
How do you resemble a way of keeping cool?
It means fanatic.
Mind you, the American bit in "Martin Chuzzlewit", what's that?
It's rubbish.
- I thought you were my fan.
- If you can't take criticism...
Do the death of Little Nell...
No, forget that.
Faster!
Who exactly is in that hearse?
My friend.
She's only 19.
Now she's in danger.
Why are we talking about dry old books?
This is much more important.
- Driver, be swift!
The chase is on!
- Attaboy, Charlie.
- Nobody calls me Charlie.
- The ladies do.
- How do you know?
- I'm your...
Number one fan.
Yes.
- What are we going to do with her?
- I don't know.
I didn't plan any of this.
It isn't my fault if the dead won't stay dead.
Then whose fault is it, sir?
Why is this happening to us?
I did the bishop a favour once - made his nephew look like a cherub though he'd been a fortnight in the weir.
Perhaps he'll do us an exorcism on the cheap.
Say I'm not in.
Just get rid of them.
- We're closed.
- Nonsense.
Undertakers don't keep office hours.
The dead don't die on schedule.
- I demand to see your master.
- He's not in.
Don't lie to me, child!
Summon him.
I'm sorry, Mr Dickens, but the master's indisposed.
- Having trouble with your gas?
- What the Shakespeare is going on?
Are you all right?
You're kidding me, yeah?
You are kidding me, aren't you?
OK.
No kidding.
- You're not allowed in, sir.
- There's something in the walls.
The gas pipes.
Something's living inside the gas.
Let me out!
Open the door!
- That's her.
- Please let me out!
- How dare you, sir?
This is my house!
- Shut up!
I told you...
Let me out!
Somebody open the door!
Open the door!
I think this is my dance.
It's a prank.
We're under some mesmeric influence.
- No.
The dead are walking.
Hi.
- Hi.
Who's your friend?
- Charles Dickens.
- OK.
I'm the Doctor.
Who are you?
- Failing.
- Open the rift.
We're dying.
Trapped in this form.
Cannot sustain.
Help us.
First you drug me, then you kidnap me - and I felt your hands having a quick wander!
- I won't be spoken to like this!
- You put me in a room full of zombies!
- You swan off and leave me to die!
- It's not my fault!
It's this house.
It always had a reputation.
Haunted.
I never had much bother until three months back.
Then the stiffs...
The... dear departed...
started getting restless.
- Tommy-rot!
- You witnessed it.
Can't keep the beggars down, sir.
They walk.
The queerest thing, they hang on to scraps...
Two sugars, sir.
How you like it.
One old sexton almost went to his own memorial service.
Just like the old lady going to your performance, sir.
- Morbid fancy.
- Charles, you were there.
- I saw nothing but an illusion.
- If you're going to deny it, just shut up.
- What about the gas?
- That's new, sir.
I've never seen that.
The rift's getting wider and something's getting through.
- What's a rift?
- A weak point in time and space.
A connection with another place.
That's the cause of ghost stories.
That's how I got the house so cheap.
Stories going back generations.
Echoes in the dark, queer songs in the air and this feeling like a shadow passing over your soul.
It's been good for business.
What people expect from a gloomy old trade like mine.
Impossible.
Checking for strings?
Wires, perhaps.
There must be some mechanism behind this fraud.
Oh, come on, Charles.
I shouldn't have told you to shut up.
I'm sorry.
You've got one of the best minds in the world.
- You saw the gas creatures.
- I cannot accept...
What does the human body do when it decomposes?
It produces gas.
Perfect home for these gas things.
They can use it as a vehicle.
- Just like your coach.
- Stop it.
Can it be that I have the world entirely wrong?
- Not wrong.
There's just more to learn.
- I've always railed against the fantasist.
I've always loved an illusion, but that's exactly what they were - illusions.
The real world is something else.
I dedicated myself to that - injustices, the great social causes.
I hoped that I was a force for good.
Now you tell me that the real world is a realm of spectres and jack-o'-lanterns.
In which case, have I wasted my brief span here, Doctor?
Has it all been for nothing?
- Miss, you shouldn't be helping.
- Don't be daft.
Sneed works you to death.
- How much do you get paid?
- Eight pound a year, miss.
- How much?
- I know.
I would have been happy with six.
- So did you even go to school or what?
- Of course I did.
What do you think I am, an urchin?
I went every Sunday, nice and proper.
- Once a week?
- We did sums and everything.
- To be honest, I hated every second.
- Me too.
Don't tell anyone, but one week...
I didn't go and I runned on the heath on my own!
I did plenty of that.
I used to go round the shops with my mate Shereen.
- We used to go and look at boys.
- I don't know much about that, miss.
Times haven't changed that much.
I bet you've done the same.
- I don't think so, miss.
- Gwyneth, you can tell me.
I bet you've got your eye on someone.
I suppose...
There is one lad.
The butcher's boy.
He comes by every Tuesday.
Such a lovely smile on him.
I like a nice smile.
Good smile.
Nice bum.
Well, I've never heard the like!
Ask him out.
Give him a cup of tea or something.
That's a start.
I swear it is the strangest thing, miss.
You've got the clothes and the breeding, but you talk like some sort of wild thing.
Maybe I am.
Maybe that's a good thing.
You need a bit more in your life than Mr Sneed.
That's not fair.
He's not so bad, old Sneed.
He was very kind to take me in.
I lost my mum and dad to the flu when I was 12.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, miss.
But I'll be with them again one day - sitting with them in paradise.
I shall be so blessed.
They're waiting for me.
Maybe your dad's up there waiting for you too, miss.
Maybe.
Um...
Who told you he was dead?
I don't know.
Must have been the Doctor.
My father died years back.
But you've been thinking about him lately.
I suppose so.
How do you know all this?
Mr Sneed says I think too much.
I'm all alone down here.
I bet you've got dozens of servants, haven't you?
- No.
No servants where I'm from.
- And you've come such a long way.
What makes you think so?
You're from London.
I've seen London in drawings, but never like that.
All those people rushing about, half-naked.
For shame.
And the noise...
And the metal boxes racing past.
And the birds in the sky...
No, they're metal as well.
Metal birds with people in them.
People are flying.
And you've flown so far, further than anyone.
The things you've seen.
The darkness...
The Big Bad Wolf.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, miss.
- It's all right.
Ever since I was a little girl, my mam said I had the sight.
But it's getting stronger, more powerful?
All the time, sir.
Every night... voices in my head.
You grew up on top of the rift.
You're part of it.
You're the key.
I've tried to make sense of it, sir.
Consulted with spiritualists, table rappers, all sorts.
That should help.
You can show us what to do.
- What do to where, sir?
- We're going to have a seance.
This is how Madam Mortlock summons those from the Land of Mists.
Come...
- Join hands.
- I can't take part.
Humbug?
Come on.
Open mind.
This is precisely the sort of cheap mummery I strive to unmask.
Seances?
Nothing but luminous tambourines and a squeeze-box concealed between the knees.
- This girl knows nothing.
- Don't antagonise her.
- I love a happy medium.
- I can't believe you said that.
Come on.
We might need you.
Good man.
Now, Gwyneth...
Reach out.
Speak to us.
Are you there, spirits?
Come.
Speak to us that we may relieve your burden.
Can you hear that?
- Nothing can happen.
This is sheer folly.
- Look at her.
I see them.
I feel them.
- What's it saying?
- It can't get through.
You're controlling it.
Look deep.
Allow them through.
- I can't.
- You can.
Just believe it.
I have faith in you, Gwyneth.
Make the link.
Yes.
Great God!
Spirits from the other side.
The other side of the universe.
- Pity us.
- Pity the Gelth.
There is so little time.
Help us.
- What do you want us to do?
- The rift.
- Take the girl to the rift.
Make a bridge.
- What for?
We are so very few - the last of our kind.
We face extinction.
Why?
What happened?
We had a physical form like you, but then the war came...
War?
What war?
The Time War.
The whole universe convulsed.
The Time War raged.
Invisible to smaller species, but devastating to higher forms.
Our bodies wasted away.
We're trapped in this gaseous state.
That's why you need the corpses.
We want to stand tall, to feel the sunlight, to live again.
We need a physical form and your dead are abandoned.
- They go to waste.
Give them to us.
- But we can't.
- Why not?
- It's not...
I mean, it's not...
Not decent?
It could save their lives.
Open the rift.
Let the Gelth through.
We're dying.
Help us.
Pity the Gelth.
Gwyneth?
All true.
Are you OK?
It's all true.
It's all right.
You just sleep.
But my angels, miss...
They came, didn't they?
They need me.
- They do.
You're their only chance.
- Leave her alone.
She's exhausted and she's not fighting your battles.
Drink this.
What did you say, Doctor?
Explain it again.
What are they?
Aliens.
- Like foreigners?
- Pretty foreign, yeah.
From up there.
- Brecon?
- Close.
They want to get from Brecon to Cardiff, but the road's blocked.
Only a few get through and they're weak.
They can only test-drive the bodies for so long, then they revert to gas.
- Which is why they need the girl.
- No.
But she can help.
She can open up the rift, make a bridge and let them through.
Incredible.
Ghosts that are not ghosts, but beings from another world, who can only exist in our world by inhabiting cadavers.
Good system.
- You can't let them inside dead people.
- Why not?
It's recycling.
- Seriously, you can't.
- Seriously, I can!
It's wrong.
Those bodies were living people.
We should respect them even in death.
- Do you carry a donor card?
- It's different.
Yes, it's a different morality.
Get used to it or go home.
Time's short.
I can't worry about a few corpses when the Gelth could be dying.
- I don't care.
They're not using her.
- Don't I get a say, miss?
Look... you don't understand what's going on.
You would say that, miss, because inside your head you think I'm stupid.
- That's not fair.
- It's true, though.
Things might be different where you're from, but here and now I know my own mind and the angels need me.
- Doctor, what do I have to do?
- You don't have to do anything.
They've been singing to me since I was a child, sent by my mam on holy mission.
- So tell me.
- We need to find the rift.
This house is on a weak spot.
Mr Sneed, what's the weakest part of this house?
- The place where most ghosts are seen.
- That would be the morgue.
Any chance you were going to say gazebo?
Talk about Bleak House.
Doctor, the Gelth don't succeed.
I know they don't.
I know corpses weren't walking around in 1869.
Time's changing every second.
Your world can be rewritten like that.
- Nothing is safe.
Remember that.
Nothing.
- Doctor...
I think the room is getting colder.
Here they come.
You've come to help.
Praise the Doctor!
Praise him!
- Promise you won't hurt her.
- Hurry.
So little time.
Pity the Gelth.
I'll take you somewhere else after.
Somewhere you can build bodies.
This isn't a permanent solution.
My angels.
I can help them live.
- Where's the weak point?
- Here.
Beneath the arch.
Beneath the arch.
- You don't have to do this.
- My angels.
Establish the bridge out of the void, let us through.
Yes.
I can see you.
I can see you...
Come.
- Bridgehead establishing.
- Come to this world, poor lost souls.
It is begun.
The bridge is made.
- She has given herself to the Gelth.
- There's rather a lot of them.
The bridge is open.
We descend.
The Gelth will come through in force.
You said you were few in number.
A few billion.
And all of us in need of corpses.
Oh, Gwyneth...
Stop this!
Listen to your master.
This has gone far enough.
Stop dabbling, child, and leave these things alone, I beg of you.
Mr Sneed!
- I think it's gone a little bit wrong.
- I have joined the legions of the Gelth.
Come.
March with us.
No...
We need bodies.
All of you... dead.
The human race... dead.
Gwyneth, send them back!
Three more bodies.
Make them vessels for the Gelth.
Doctor, I can't...
Sorry.
This new world of yours is too much for me.
I'm so...
Give yourself to glory.
Sacrifice your lives to the Gelth.
- I trusted you.
I pitied you.
- We don't want your pity!
- We want this world and all its flesh!
- Not while I'm alive.
Then live no more.
But I can't die.
Tell me I can't.
I haven't even been born yet.
It's impossible for me to die.
Isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Failing.
Atmosphere hostile.
Gas...
Gas!
But it's 1869.
How can I die now?
Time isn't a straight line.
It can twist into any shape.
You can be born in the 20th century and die in the 19th and it's my fault.
I brought you here.
It's not your fault.
I wanted to come.
What about me?
I saw the fall of Troy, World War Five.
I pushed boxes at the Boston Tea Party.
Now I'm going to die in a dungeon... in Cardiff!
It's not just dying...
We're going to become one of them.
- We'll go down fighting, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Together?
- Yeah.
I'm so glad I met you.
Me too.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Turn off the flame, turn up the gas!
- Fill the room now!
- What are you doing?
Turn it all on.
Flood the place!
- Brilliant.
Gas.
- So we choke to death instead?
Am I correct, Doctor?
These creatures are gaseous.
Fill the room with gas, it'll draw them out of the host - like poison from a wound.
I hope...
Oh, Lord.
I hope that this theory will be validated soon... if not immediately.
Plenty more!
It's working.
Gwyneth!
Send them back!
They lied.
They're not angels.
- Liars?
- Look at me.
If your mother and father could see this, they'd tell you the same.
They'd give you strength.
Send them back.
- I can't breathe.
- Charles, get her out.
- I'm not leaving her!
- They're too strong.
Remember Rose's world?
None of it will exist unless you send them back through the rift.
I can't send them back.
But I can hold them.
Hold them in this place, hold them here.
Get out.
- You can't!
- Leave this place!
Get out!
I won't leave her while she's in danger.
Leave that to me.
This way.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
- She didn't make it.
- I'm sorry.
She closed the rift.
At such a cost.
The poor child.
I did try, but Gwyneth was already dead.
- She had been for at least five minutes.
- What do you mean?
She was dead when she stood in that arch.
But she can't have...
She spoke to us.
She helped us.
She saved us.
How could she have done that?
"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
Even for you, Doctor.
She saved the world.
A servant girl.
No one will ever know.
Right, then, Charlie boy.
I've just got to go into my... shed.
- Won't be long.
- What are you going to do now?
I shall take the mail coach back to London, post-haste.
This is no time for me to be on my own.
I shall spend Christmas with my family and make amends to them.
After all I've learned tonight, there can be nothing more vital.
- You've cheered up.
- Exceedingly.
I thought I knew everything in the world.
Now I know I've just started.
All these huge and wonderful notions.
I'm inspired.
I must write about them.
- Do you think that's wise?
- I shall be subtle... at first.
"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood" still lacks an ending.
Perhaps the killer was not the boy's uncle.
Perhaps he was not of this earth.
"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood And The Blue Elementals".
I can spread the word, the truth.
Good luck with it.
Nice to meet you.
Fantastic.
Bye, then.
And thanks.
Oh, my dear...
How modern.
Thank you.
But I don't understand...
In what way is this goodbye?
- Where are you going?
- You'll see.
In the shed.
'Pon my soul, Doctor.
It's one riddle after another with you.
After all these revelations, there's one mystery you still haven't explained.
Answer me this...
Who are you?
Just a friend, passing through.
But you have such knowledge of future times...
I don't wish to impose on you, but I must ask you.
My books, Doctor... do they last?
Oh, yes.
- For how long?
- For ever.
Right.
Shed.
Come on, Rose.
In the box?
Both of you?
Down, boy.
See you.
Doesn't it change history if he writes about blue ghosts?
In a week it's 1870 and that's the year he dies.
He'll never get to tell his story.
Oh, no.
He was so nice.
In your time he was dead.
We've brought him back to life.
He's more alive now than he's ever been.
Let's give him one last surprise.
- Merry Christmas, sir.
- Merry Christmas to you.
God bless us, every one!
Big Ben destroyed as a UFO crash-lands in central London.
- Are they invading?
- By putting the world on red alert?
I'll put the country under martial law if I have to!
Defence Plan Delta!
Come on, move, move!
Clear!
ALARM CLOCK BUZZES

See you later.
'This is a customer announcement.
The store closes in five minutes.'
Oi!
Wilson?
I've got the lottery money.
Wilson?
You there?
I can't hang about cos they're closing the shop.
Wilson?
(Oh, come on.)
SOMETHING BANGS Hello?
Hello?
Wilson, it's Rose.
Hello?
W...
Wilson?
Wilson!
Wilson?
DOOR SLAMS SHUT
(Oh, you're kidding me!
)
SOMETHING BANGS
Is that someone mucking about?
Who is it?
OK.
You got me.
Very funny.
Right, I've got the joke!
Whose idea was this?
Is it Derek's?
Is it?
Derek, is this you?
Run!
You pulled his arm off!
Yep, plastic.
Very clever, nice trick.
Who are they, students?
A student thing?
Why would they be students?
I don't know!
You said it.
Why students?
Cos... that many people dressed up and being silly has to be students.
That makes sense.
Well done.
Thanks.
They're not students.
When Wilson finds them, he'll call the police.
- Who's Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
- Wilson's dead.
That's just not funny.
That's sick!
Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this.
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there...?
I said WHO are they?
They're living plastic creatures.
They're being controlled by a relay device from the roof, which would be a great big problem
IF I didn't have this.
So I'm gonna go upstairs and blow it up.
I might well die, but don't worry(!
)
You go home.
Go and have your lovely beans on toast.
Don't tell anyone.
If you do, you'll get them killed.
I'm the Doctor, what's your name?
Rose.
Nice to meet you.
Run for your life!
TV: 'Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire.'
I know, it's on the telly!
It's everywhere, she's lucky to be alive.
Honestly, it's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.
You'd think I was her daughter.
Oh, and here's himself.
I've been phoning!
You could have been dead!
It's all on the news!
I can't believe your shop went up!
Honestly, I'm fine.
Don't fuss!
But what happened?
I don't know.
What caused it?
I wasn't in there.
I was outside, I didn't see anything.
It's Debbie.
She knows a man on the Mirror, 500 quid for an interview.
Oh, that's brilliant, give it here.
You've got to find some way to make money.
I'm not bailing you out.
PHONE RINGS
Bev, she's alive!
I've told her, sue for compensation...
She was within seconds of death.
You drinking tea?
That's no good!
You need something stronger.
I'm OK.
You deserve a proper drink.
We're going down the pub.
My treat.
Is there a match on?
...
No, no...
I'm just thinking about you!
There's a match on, ain't there?
We COULD catch the last five minutes.
Go on, then.
I'm fine, really, go.
And get rid of that.
Bye-bye.
Bye!
Aaaggghhh!
'15 fire crews are present, though it's thought there's little chance 'of saving the infrastructure.'
ALARM CLOCK BUZZES
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
You could try them.
They've always got jobs.
Oh, great, the butcher's.
It might be good.
You were getting airs and graces.
I'm not joking about compensation, you've had genuine shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council, just cos the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek!
I know she is Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, you're such a liar!
I said to nail the cat-flap.
We'll get strays!
I did it weeks back.
Na... you thought about it.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
What do you do that for?
Cos I do!
I'm here cos someone blew up my job!
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
Nope, bonehead.
Bye.
You, inside, right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
He's part of the inquiry.
She deserves compensation!
Oh, we're talking millions.
I'm...
I'm in my dressing gown.
Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
..Well, anything could happen.
No.
Don't mind the mess.
Coffee?
Might as well, thanks, just milk.
We should go to the police.
Seriously.
That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you, even if it was some sort of joke...
Sad ending.
It said on the news they found a body. "Rose Tyler."
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!
He was nice.
He was a nice bloke.
Anyway, if we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying.
I want you to explain.
Maybe not.
FLAPPING SOUND What's that?
...
Have you got a cat?
No.
We did have, but we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
I told Mickey to chuck that out.
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?
It's all right, I've stopped it.
There.
See... armless!
You think?
!
Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off?
I can.
This is me, swanning off.
But that arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
Well observed.
You can't walk away!
That's not fair.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
No, I don't.
All right, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
Tell me or I'll talk.
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Sort of.
Doesn't work.
Who are you?
Told you, the Doctor.
Yeah, but Doctor what?
Just the Doctor.
The Doctor?
Hello!
Is that meant to sound impressive?
!
Sort of.
Come on then, you can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?
No!
I was just passing.
I'm a long way from home...
But what have I done wrong?
How come those plastic things come after me?
Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you.
You got in the way, that's all.
It tried to kill me!
It was after me, not you!
I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined it all!
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down.
It fixed on you cos you'd met me.
So, you're saying the entire world revolves around you?
Sort of, yeah.
You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah.
All this plastic stuff, who else knows?
No-one.
What, you're on your own?
Well, who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep and watch telly while underneath you, there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
I mean, if we're going with living plastic, and I don't believe that, how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into it.
I cut off the signal.
So, radio control?
Thought control.
You all right?
Yeah.
So... who's controlling it, then?
Long story.
What's it all for?
Shop window dummies, what's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
!
No!
Well, no!
It's not a price war.
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
Do you believe me?
No.
But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor...
Tell me.
Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid.
The first time they tell you the world's turning and you can't believe it cos it looks like everything's standing still.
..I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour.
The entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour.
I can feel it, we're falling through Space, you and me.
Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
STRANGE MACHINE-LIKE NOISE
H... hey, here's my woman!
Kit off.
Oh, shut up.
Coffee?
Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?
Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom.
Don't read my e-mails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did!
That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.
Dad!
It's one of your nutters.
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive.
Obviously.
I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's in the car, in case you kill me!
No, good point!
No murders!
Who is it?
It's to do with the Doctor, she's been reading the website.
Please come through, I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she?
This is quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it.
People might intercept.
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.
Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just the Doctor.
Always the Doctor.
The title seems to be passed from father to son, like an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive, last year.
The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original...
November 22nd 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy.
See.
Must be his father.
Going further back...
April 1912, this is a photograph of the Daniels family of Southampton, and friend...
Taken the day before they were due to go to the new world.
On the Titanic.
But for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip, and survived.
And here we are... 1883, another Doctor.
Look, the same lineage, he's identical...
This one washed up on the Sumatran coast, the night Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend, woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings the storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on then.
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... ..then God help you.
BIN ROARS
BIN BURPS But who is he?
Who d'you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.
Complete online conspiracy freak, you win!
So, what are we going to do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
Pizza!
Puh-puh-puh.
Pizza!
Or Chinese.
Pizzaaaaaaaa!
Should I try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it then, dishing out chips?
I could do A-levels.
I dunno.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school cos of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
So where did you meet this Doctor?
Oh, sorry, was I talking about me?
I reckon it started at the shop, am I right?
Was he something to do with that?
No.
Come on.
Sort of.
What was he doing there?
I'm not going on about it, really I'm not.
Cos I know it sounds daft, but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
You can trust me, sweetheart.
HIS VOICE IS ROBOTIC AT TURNS Babe, darling, sugar...
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning.
I can help you, Rose.
That's all I want, sweetheart, darling, babe, sugar sweetheart.
What are you doing that for?
Champagne.
We didn't order any.
Where's the Doctor?
Madam, your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?
I need know out how much he knows, so where is he?
Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
Look, we didn't order...
Ah, gotcha.
Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway!
Don't think that's gonna stop me.
Everyone, out, now!
Get out, get out, get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing!
Sonic screwdriver.
Use it!
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.
You can't hide in a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
It's gonna follow us.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but a head's perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where d'you want to start?
Um...
The inside's bigger than the outside.
Yes.
It's... alien.
Yep...
Are you alien?
Yes.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
It's called the Tardis, this thing.
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
Happens to the best of us.
Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh, I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend!
You pulled off his head, they copied him, and you didn't even think?
Now you're just gonna let him melt.
Melt?
!
Aw, no, no, no, NO!
What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading!
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!
Almost there, almost there...
Here we go!
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!
I lost the signal.
I got so close.
We've moved.
Does it fly?
It disappears there and reappears here.
But if we're... somewhere else, that headless thing's still on the loose.
Melted with the head.
Are you gonna witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him.
Again!
You were right.
You are alien.
If I did forget some kid called Mickey.
He's not a kid!
..It's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right?
All right?
!
Yes, it is!
If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north?
Lots of planets have a north!
..What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box, from the 1950s.
It's a disguise.
OK.
And, this, this living plastic, what's it got against us?
Nothing.
It loves you.
You've got a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins, perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted.
So.
Earth.
Dinner.
Any way of stopping it?
Antiplastic.
Antiplastic?
Antiplastic!
But first, I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
Hide what?
A transmitter.
The Consciousness is controlling all plastic, a transmitter boosts the signal.
What does it look like?
A transmitter!
Round and massive - in the middle of London.
A huge, metal, circular structure, like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing, it must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think.
Plastic.
Everywhere, every artificial thing waiting to be alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires, cables.
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.
Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach.
Oh, my God.
Mickey!
It's me!
It's OK.
It's all right.
Shhh.
That thing, down there...
The liquid, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
Yeah, that was always a possibility - keep him alive to maintain the copy.
You knew that and never said?
!
Can we keep domestics outside, thank you!
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp, shunt technology.
So, may I suggest, with greatest respect, that you shunt off?
!
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I AM TALKING!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid, little people have just learnt how to walk.
They are capable of so much more.
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go.
Doctor!
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy, I swear.
What do you mean?
No!
Honestly, no...
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true!
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.
What's it doing?
It's the Tardis.
The Nestene's identified it as superior technology.
It's terrified!
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion...
Get out, Rose!
Just leg it!
Mum?
Oh, there you are.
I was gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation.
I've got this document thing off the police.
Don't thank me!
Where are you, Mum?
I'm in town.
Look, go!
Just go home right now.
Darling, you're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit shopping.
I'll see you later, ta-ra.
Mum?
Mum?
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
My God!
I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I've read.
All those stories, it's all true.
Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
RUN!
The stairs have gone.
I haven't got a key...
We're gonna die!
Leave him!
There's nothing you can do!
I've got no A-levels, no job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I have got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s gymnastic team.
I got the bronze!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose, don't go out of the house!
'Lt's not safe.
There are these things, they were shooting and... '
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
You were useless!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I would.
..Thank you.
Right, then!
I'll be off.
Unless...
I dunno.
You could come with me.
This box isn't just a London hopper, you know.
It goes anywhere in the universe.
Free of charge.
Don't!
He's an alien, he's a thing.
He's not invited.
What d'you think?
You could... stay here.
Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go... anywhere.
Is it always this dangerous?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump.
So...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
Thanks.
Thanks for what?
Exactly.
This is the year five billion, and this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
Ooh, I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler.
She's my plus one, is that all right?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
That's not supposed to happen.

Derek, is this you?
Run!
You pulled his arm off!
Yep, plastic.
Very clever, nice trick.
Who are they, students?
A student thing?
Why would they be students?
I don't know!
You said it.
Why students?
Cos... that many people dressed up and being silly has to be students.
That makes sense.
Well done.
Thanks.
They're not students.
When Wilson finds them, he'll call the police.
- Who's Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
- Wilson's dead.
That's just not funny.
That's sick!
Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this.
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there...?
I said WHO are they?
They're living plastic creatures.
They're being controlled by a relay device from the roof, which would be a great big problem
IF I didn't have this.
So I'm gonna go upstairs and blow it up.
I might well die, but don't worry(!
)
You go home.
Go and have your lovely beans on toast.
Don't tell anyone.
If you do, you'll get them killed.
I'm the Doctor, what's your name?
Rose.
Nice to meet you.
Run for your life!
TV: 'Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire.'
I know, it's on the telly!
It's everywhere, she's lucky to be alive.
Honestly, it's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.
You'd think I was her daughter.
Oh, and here's himself.
I've been phoning!
You could have been dead!
It's all on the news!
I can't believe your shop went up!
Honestly, I'm fine.
Don't fuss!
But what happened?
I don't know.
What caused it?
I wasn't in there.
I was outside, I didn't see anything.
It's Debbie.
She knows a man on the Mirror, 500 quid for an interview.
Oh, that's brilliant, give it here.
You've got to find some way to make money.
I'm not bailing you out.
PHONE RINGS
Bev, she's alive!
I've told her, sue for compensation...
She was within seconds of death.
You drinking tea?
That's no good!
You need something stronger.
I'm OK.
You deserve a proper drink.
We're going down the pub.
My treat.
Is there a match on?
...
No, no...
I'm just thinking about you!
There's a match on, ain't there?
We COULD catch the last five minutes.
Go on, then.
I'm fine, really, go.
And get rid of that.
Bye-bye.
Bye!
Aaaggghhh!
'15 fire crews are present, though it's thought there's little chance 'of saving the infrastructure.'
ALARM CLOCK BUZZES
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
You could try them.
They've always got jobs.
Oh, great, the butcher's.
It might be good.
You were getting airs and graces.
I'm not joking about compensation, you've had genuine shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council, just cos the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek!
I know she is Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, you're such a liar!
I said to nail the cat-flap.
We'll get strays!
I did it weeks back.
Na... you thought about it.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
What do you do that for?
Cos I do!
I'm here cos someone blew up my job!
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
Nope, bonehead.
Bye.
You, inside, right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
He's part of the inquiry.
She deserves compensation!
Oh, we're talking millions.
I'm...
I'm in my dressing gown.
Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
..Well, anything could happen.
No.
Don't mind the mess.
Coffee?
Might as well, thanks, just milk.
We should go to the police.
Seriously.
That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you, even if it was some sort of joke...
Sad ending.
It said on the news they found a body. "Rose Tyler."
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!
He was nice.
He was a nice bloke.
Anyway, if we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying.
I want you to explain.
Maybe not.
FLAPPING SOUND What's that?
...
Have you got a cat?
No.
We did have, but we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
I told Mickey to chuck that out.
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?
It's all right, I've stopped it.
There.
See... armless!
You think?
!
Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off?
I can.
This is me, swanning off.
But that arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
Well observed.
You can't walk away!
That's not fair.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
No, I don't.
All right, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
Tell me or I'll talk.
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Sort of.
Doesn't work.
Who are you?
Told you, the Doctor.
Yeah, but Doctor what?
Just the Doctor.
The Doctor?
Hello!
Is that meant to sound impressive?
!
Sort of.
Come on then, you can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?
No!
I was just passing.
I'm a long way from home...
But what have I done wrong?
How come those plastic things come after me?
Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you.
You got in the way, that's all.
It tried to kill me!
It was after me, not you!
I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined it all!
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down.
It fixed on you cos you'd met me.
So, you're saying the entire world revolves around you?
Sort of, yeah.
You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah.
All this plastic stuff, who else knows?
No-one.
What, you're on your own?
Well, who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep and watch telly while underneath you, there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
I mean, if we're going with living plastic, and I don't believe that, how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into it.
I cut off the signal.
So, radio control?
Thought control.
You all right?
Yeah.
So... who's controlling it, then?
Long story.
What's it all for?
Shop window dummies, what's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
!
No!
Well, no!
It's not a price war.
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
Do you believe me?
No.
But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor...
Tell me.
Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid.
The first time they tell you the world's turning and you can't believe it cos it looks like everything's standing still.
..I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour.
The entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour.
I can feel it, we're falling through Space, you and me.
Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
STRANGE MACHINE-LIKE NOISE
H... hey, here's my woman!
Kit off.
Oh, shut up.
Coffee?
Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?
Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom.
Don't read my e-mails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did!
That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.
Dad!
It's one of your nutters.
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive.
Obviously.
I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's in the car, in case you kill me!
No, good point!
No murders!
Who is it?
It's to do with the Doctor, she's been reading the website.
Please come through, I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she?
This is quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it.
People might intercept.
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.
Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just the Doctor.
Always the Doctor.
The title seems to be passed from father to son, like an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive, last year.
The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original...
November 22nd 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy.
See.
Must be his father.
Going further back...
April 1912, this is a photograph of the Daniels family of Southampton, and friend...
Taken the day before they were due to go to the new world.
On the Titanic.
But for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip, and survived.
And here we are... 1883, another Doctor.
Look, the same lineage, he's identical...
This one washed up on the Sumatran coast, the night Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend, woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings the storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on then.
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... ..then God help you.
BIN ROARS
BIN BURPS But who is he?
Who d'you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.
Complete online conspiracy freak, you win!
So, what are we going to do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
Pizza!
Puh-puh-puh.
Pizza!
Or Chinese.
Pizzaaaaaaaa!
Should I try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it then, dishing out chips?
I could do A-levels.
I dunno.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school cos of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
So where did you meet this Doctor?
Oh, sorry, was I talking about me?
I reckon it started at the shop, am I right?
Was he something to do with that?
No.
Come on.
Sort of.
What was he doing there?
I'm not going on about it, really I'm not.
Cos I know it sounds daft, but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
You can trust me, sweetheart.
HIS VOICE IS ROBOTIC AT TURNS Babe, darling, sugar...
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning.
I can help you, Rose.
That's all I want, sweetheart, darling, babe, sugar sweetheart.
What are you doing that for?
Champagne.
We didn't order any.
Where's the Doctor?
Madam, your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?
I need know out how much he knows, so where is he?
Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
Look, we didn't order...
Ah, gotcha.
Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway!
Don't think that's gonna stop me.
Everyone, out, now!
Get out, get out, get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing!
Sonic screwdriver.
Use it!
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.
You can't hide in a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
It's gonna follow us.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but a head's perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where d'you want to start?
Um...
The inside's bigger than the outside.
Yes.
It's... alien.
Yep...
Are you alien?
Yes.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
It's called the Tardis, this thing.
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
Happens to the best of us.
Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh, I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend!
You pulled off his head, they copied him, and you didn't even think?
Now you're just gonna let him melt.
Melt?
!
Aw, no, no, no, NO!
What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading!
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!
Almost there, almost there...
Here we go!
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!
I lost the signal.
I got so close.
We've moved.
Does it fly?
It disappears there and reappears here.
But if we're... somewhere else, that headless thing's still on the loose.
Melted with the head.
Are you gonna witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him.
Again!
You were right.
You are alien.
If I did forget some kid called Mickey.
He's not a kid!
..It's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right?
All right?
!
Yes, it is!
If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north?
Lots of planets have a north!
..What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box, from the 1950s.
It's a disguise.
OK.
And, this, this living plastic, what's it got against us?
Nothing.
It loves you.
You've got a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins, perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted.
So.
Earth.
Dinner.
Any way of stopping it?
Antiplastic.
Antiplastic?
Antiplastic!
But first, I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
Hide what?
A transmitter.
The Consciousness is controlling all plastic, a transmitter boosts the signal.
What does it look like?
A transmitter!
Round and massive - in the middle of London.
A huge, metal, circular structure, like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing, it must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think.
Plastic.
Everywhere, every artificial thing waiting to be alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires, cables.
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.
Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach.
Oh, my God.
Mickey!
It's me!
It's OK.
It's all right.
Shhh.
That thing, down there...
The liquid, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
Yeah, that was always a possibility - keep him alive to maintain the copy.
You knew that and never said?
!
Can we keep domestics outside, thank you!
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp, shunt technology.
So, may I suggest, with greatest respect, that you shunt off?
!
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I AM TALKING!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid, little people have just learnt how to walk.
They are capable of so much more.
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go.
Doctor!
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy, I swear.
What do you mean?
No!
Honestly, no...
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true!
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.
What's it doing?
It's the Tardis.
The Nestene's identified it as superior technology.
It's terrified!
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion...
Get out, Rose!
Just leg it!
Mum?
Oh, there you are.
I was gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation.
I've got this document thing off the police.
Don't thank me!
Where are you, Mum?
I'm in town.
Look, go!
Just go home right now.
Darling, you're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit shopping.
I'll see you later, ta-ra.
Mum?
Mum?
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
My God!
I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I've read.
All those stories, it's all true.
Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
RUN!
The stairs have gone.
I haven't got a key...
We're gonna die!
Leave him!
There's nothing you can do!
I've got no A-levels, no job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I have got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s gymnastic team.
I got the bronze!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose, don't go out of the house!
'Lt's not safe.
There are these things, they were shooting and... '
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
You were useless!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I would.
..Thank you.
Right, then!
I'll be off.
Unless...
I dunno.
You could come with me.
This box isn't just a London hopper, you know.
It goes anywhere in the universe.
Free of charge.
Don't!
He's an alien, he's a thing.
He's not invited.
What d'you think?
You could... stay here.
Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go... anywhere.
Is it always this dangerous?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump.
So...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
Thanks.
Thanks for what?
Exactly.
This is the year five billion, and this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
Ooh, I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler.
She's my plus one, is that all right?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
That's not supposed to happen.
Subtitles by Leanne Matheson, BBC Broadcast 2005
- Bye.
- See you later.
Bye!
This is a customer announcement.
The store will be closing in five minutes.
Thank you.
Oi!
Wilson?
Wilson, I've got the lottery money.
Wilson?
You there?
Look, I can't hang about 'cause they're closing the shop.
Wilson?
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Hello?
Wilson, it's Rose.
Hello?
Wilson?
Wilson?
Wilson!
Oh, you're kidding me!
Is that someone mucking about?
Who is it?
Okay.
You got me.
Very funny.
Right, I've got the joke!
Whose idea was this?
Is it Derek's?
Is it?
Derek, is this you?
Run!
- You pulled his arm off!
- Yep, plastic.
Very clever, nice trick.
Who are they then, students?
Is this a student thing or what?
- Why would they be students?
- I don't know!
Well, you said it.
Why students?
'Cause...
To get that many people dressed up and being silly, they got to be students.
That makes sense.
Well done.
- Thanks.
- They're not students.
Whoever they are, when Wilson finds them, he's going to call the police.
- Who's Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
Wilson's dead.
- That's just not funny.
That's sick!
- Hold on!
- Mind your eyes.
- I've had enough of this now.
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there?
I said who are they?
They're made of plastic.
Living plastic creatures.
And they're being controlled by a relay device on the roof.
Which would be a great big problem if I didn't have this.
So, I'm gonna go upstairs and blow it up.
And I might well die in the process, but don't worry about me.
No, you go home.
Go on, go and have your lovely beans on toast.
Don't tell anyone about this, 'cause if you do, you'll get them killed.
I'm the Doctor, by the way.
- What's your name?
- Rose.
Nice to meet you, Rose.
Run for your life!
The whole of Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire.
I know, it's on the telly!
It's everywhere, she's lucky to be alive.
Honestly, it's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.
He's walking in now.
You'd think I was her daughter.
Oh, and here's himself.
I've been phoning your mobile!
You could have been dead!
It's on the news and everything!
I can't believe that your shop went up!
I'm all right.
Honestly, I'm fine.
Don't make a fuss!
- But what happened?
- I don't know.
What was it though?
What caused it?
I wasn't in the shop.
I was outside.
Didn't see anything.
It's Debbie on the end.
She knows a man on The Mirror, 500 quid for an interview.
Oh, that's brilliant, give it here.
You've got to find some way of making money.
Your job's kaput and I'm not bailing you out.
Bev, she's alive!
I've told her, sue for compensation.
She was within seconds of death!
What are you drinking, tea?
No, no, no.
That's no good!
That's no good!
You're in shock.
- You need something stronger.
- I'm all right.
Now, come one.
You deserve a proper drink.
We're going down the pub.
You and me, my treat.
How about it?
Is there a match on?
No, no.
I'm just thinking about you!
There's a match on, ain't there?
Well that's not the point.
But we could catch the last five minutes.
Go on, then.
I'm fine, really, go.
And get rid of that.
'BYE-bye.
- Bye!
Fifteen fire crews are in attendance, though it's thought there's very little chance of saving the infrastructure.
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
You could try them.
- They've always got jobs.
- Oh, great, the butcher's.
It might do you good.
That shop was giving you airs and graces.
I'm not joking about compensation.
You've had genuine shock and trauma.
Ariana got two thousand quid off the council just because the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek!
I know she is Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, you're such a liar!
I said to nail that cat-flap down.
We're gonna get strays!
- I did it weeks back.
- Nah, you thought about it.
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.
- What do you do that for?
- 'Cause I do!
I'm only home 'cause someone blew up my job!
Must have got the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
Nope, bonehead.
Bye, then!
You, inside, right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
He's part of the inquiry.
Give us 10 minutes.
She deserves compensation!
Oh, we're talking millions.
I'm...
I'm in my dressing gown.
Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
Well, anything could happen.
No.
Don't mind the mess.
Do you want a coffee?
Might as well, thanks, just milk.
We should go to the police.
Seriously.
Both of us.
That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you, even if it was some sort of joke...
Mmm.
Sad ending.
- It said on the news they found a body.
- "Rose Tyler."
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!
...all the same, he was nice.
He was a nice bloke.
Anyway, if we are gonna go to the police,
I wanna know what I'm saying.
- I want you to explain everything.
- Maybe not.
What's that then?
Have you got a cat?
No.
We did have, but we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
I told Mickey to chuck that out.
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what was it?
It's all right, I've stopped it.
- There you go, you see, armless!
- Do you think?
Ow!
Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off!
Yes.
I can.
Here I am.
This is me, swanning off, see ya!
That arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
Ten out of ten for observation.
You can't just walk away.
That's not fair.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
No, I don't.
All right, then.
I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said if I did that I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
Tell me or I'll start talking.
- Is that supposed to sound tough?

Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you.
You were just an accident.
You got in the way, that's all.
- It tried to kill me!
- It was after me, not you!
Last night, in the shop, I was there, you blundered in, almost ruined the whole thing.
This morning, I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down...
The only reason it fixed on you is because you met me.
So, what you're saying is the entire world revolves around you?
- Sort of, yeah.
- You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah.
All this plastic stuff, who else knows about it?
No one.
What, you're on your own?
Well, who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, got to bed and watch telly, while all the time underneath you, there's a war going on.
Okay.
Start from the beginning.
I mean, if we're going with the living plastic, and I don't even believe that, but if we do...
How did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into the arm.
I cut off the signal.
Dead.
- So, that's radio control?
- Thought control.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
So who's controlling it, then?
- Long story.
- What's it all for?
I mean, shop window dummies, what's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
No!
- Well, no!
- It's not a price war.
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
- Do you believe me?
- No.
But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor, tell me, who are you?
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid.
The first time they tell you that the world's turning and you just can't quite believe it 'cause everything looks like it's standing still.
I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1,000 miles an hour.
And the entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67,000 miles an hour.
I can feel it, we're falling through space, you and me.
Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
- Hey, here's my woman!
Kit off.
- Oh, shut up.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
And I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?
Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom.
Don't read my e-mails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
Yeah, who told you that?
He did.
That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.
Oh, Dad!
It's one of your nutters.
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive.
Obviously.
I'd better tell you now, my boyfriend's in the car, just in case you're gonna kill me!
No, good point!
No murders!
Who is it?
Oh, it's something to do with the Doctor.
She's been reading the website.
Please come through.
I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she?
A lot of this stuff is quite sensitive,
I couldn't just send it to you.
People might intercept...
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.
Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just "the Doctor".
Always the Doctor.
And the title seems to be passed down from father to son, appears to be an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive, just last year.
The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original...
November 22nd 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy.
See?
Must be his father.
Going further back,
April 1912, this is a photograph of the Daniels family of Southampton and friend.
Taken the day before they were due to sail to the new world.
On the Titanic.
And for some unknown reason, they canceled the trip, and survived.
And here we are,
1883, another Doctor.
Look, the same lineage, he's identical.
This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra, and the very night the Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings the storm in his wake.
- And he has one constant companion.
- Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, then one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on then.
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls,
then God help you.
But who is he?
Who do you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.
Complete online conspiracy freak, you win!
What are we going to do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
Pizza!
- Pizza!
- Or Chinese.
Pizza!
Do you think I should try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it then, dishing out chips?
I could do A-levels.
I don't know.
It's all Jimmy Stone's fault.
I went and left school because of him, look where I ended up.
What do you think?
So where did you meet this Doctor?
I'm sorry, was I talking about me for a second?
'Cause I reckon it all started back at the shop, am I right?
- Was he something to do with that?
- No.
Come on.
Sort of.
What was he doing there?
I'm not going on about it, Mickey, really I'm not.
'Cause I know it sounds daft, but,
I don't think he's safe.
- He's dangerous.
- But you can trust me, sweetheart.
Babe, darling, sugar...
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning, and I can help you, Rose.
That's all I want to do, sweetheart.
Darling, babe, babe, sugar, sweetheart.
What are you doing that for?
- Your champagne.
- We didn't order any champagne.
- Where's the Doctor?
- Madam, your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?
I need to find out how much he knows, so where is he?
- Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
- Look, we didn't order...
- Ah, got you.
- Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway!
Don't think that's gonna stop me.
Everyone, out!
Out now!
Get out, get out, get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing!
Come on!
- Sonic screwdriver.
- Use it!
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.
You can't hide inside a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
It's gonna follow us.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but the head's perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where do you want to start?
Um...
The inside's bigger than the outside.
- Yes.
- It's alien.
Yep.
Are you alien?
Yes.
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.
It's called the Tardis, this thing.
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's okay.
Culture shock.
- Happens to the best of us.
- Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh, I didn't think Of that.
He's my boyfriend.
You pulled off his head.
They copied him, and you didn't even think.
- And now you're just gonna let him melt.
- Melt?
Aw, no, no, no, no!
- What are you doing?
- Following the signal.
It's fading!
Wait a minute.
I've got it.
No,no,no,no,no,no,no!
Almost there, almost there.
Here we go!
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!
I lost the signal.
I got so close.
We've moved.
Does it fly?
It disappears there and reappears here.
You wouldn't understand.
But if we're somewhere else, what about that headless thing that's still on the loose?
Melted with the head.
Are you going to witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey...
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him, again!
You were right.
You are alien.
- Look, if I did forget some kid called Mickey...
- He's not a kid!
...it's because I'm trying to save the life of every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right?
- All right?
- Yes, it is!
If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north?
Lots of planets have a north!
What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box, from the 1950s.
It's a disguise.
Okay...
And, this living plastic, what's it got against us?
Nothing. it loves you.
You've got such a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins in the air.
Perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted.
- So.
Earth.
Dinner.
- Any way of stopping it?
Antiplastic.
- Antiplastic?
- Antiplastic!
But first, I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
- Hold on, hide what?
- The transmitter.
The Consciousness is controlling every single piece of plastic, so it needs a transmitter to boost the signal.
- What does it look like?
- Like a transmitter!
Round and massive, somewhere slap-bang in the middle of London.
A huge, metal, circular structure like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing.
It must be completely invisible.
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think of it.
Plastic all over the world,
every artificial thing waiting to be alive.
The shop window dummies, the phones, the wires, the cables.
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.
Well then, tip in your Antiplastic and let's go.
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract
according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach.
Oh, my God.
Mickey!
It's me!
It's okay.
- It's all right.
It's all right.
- Shhh.
That thing, down there...
The liquid, Rose, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
Yeah, that was always a possibility, keep him alive to maintain the copy.
You knew that and never said?
Can we keep the domestics outside, thank you?
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilization by means of warped, shunt technology.
So, may I suggest, with the greatest respect, that you shunt off?
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I am talking!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid little people have only just leaned how to walk.
But they're capable of so much more.
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go.
Doctor!
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy, I swear, I'm not.
What do you mean?
No, no, no!
Honestly, no.
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true!
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.
- What's it doing?
- It's the Tardis.
The Nestene's identified it as superior technology.
It's terrified!
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion.
Get out, Rose!
Just leg it, now!
- Mum?
- Oh, there you are.
I was just gonna phone.
You can get compensation, I said so.
I've got this document thing off the police, don't thank me...
- Where are you, Mum?
- I'm in town.
Look, just go home!
Just go home right now.
Darling, you're breaking up.
Listen I'm just gonna do a bit of late night shopping
I'll see you later.
Ta-ra!
Mum?
Mum?
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.
It's the end of the world.
There's no point creating a spreadsheet
if you're gonna spend summer money in winter months.
Oh, my God!
I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I've read, all those stories, it's all true!
Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
Run!
The stairs have gone.
I haven't got the key.
We're gonna die!
Time Lord!
Leave him!
There's nothing you can do!
I've got no A-levels.
No job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I have got.
Jericho Street Junior School under-sevens gymnastics team.
I got the bronze!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose, don't go out of the house, it's not safe!
There are these things, they were shooting and...
Hello?
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
You were useless in there!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I would.
Thank you.
Right, then!
I'll be off.
Unless...
I don't know.
You could come with me.
This box isn't just a London-op, you know, it goes anywhere in the universe.
Free of charge.
Don't!
He's an alien.
He's a thing.
He's not invited.
What do you think?
You could stay here.
Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go...
Anywhere.
- Is it always this dangerous?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I can't.
I've gotta go and find my mum, and someone's gotta look after this stupid lump, so...
Okay.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
- Thanks.
- Thanks for what?
Exactly.
This is the year five billion,
and this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
Oh, I'm the Doctor, this is Rose Tyler.
She's my plus one, is that all right?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human, the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
That's not supposed to happen.
Bye.
See you later.
'This is a customer announcement.
The store closes in five minutes.'
Oi!
Wilson?
I've got the lottery money.
Wilson?
You there?
I can't hang about cos they're closing the shop.
Wilson?
(Oh, come on.)
Hello?
Hello?
Wilson, it's Rose.
Hello?
W...
Wilson?
Wilson!
Wilson?
(Oh, you're kidding me!
)
Is that someone mucking about?
Who is it?
OK.
You got me.
Very funny.
Right, I've got the joke!
Whose idea was this?
Is it Derek's?
Is it?
Derek, is this you?
Run!
You pulled his arm off!
Yep, plastic.
Very clever, nice trick.
Who are they, students?
A student thing?
Why would they be students?
I don't know!
You said it.
Why students?
Cos... that many people dressed up and being silly has to be students.
That makes sense.
Well done.
Thanks.
They're not students.
When Wilson finds them, he'll call the police.
- Who's Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
- Wilson's dead.
That's just not funny.
That's sick!
Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this.
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there...?
I said WHO are they?
They're living plastic creatures.
They're being controlled by a relay device from the roof, which would be a great big problem
IF I didn't have this.
So I'm gonna go upstairs and blow it up.
I might well die, but don't worry(!
)
You go home.
Go and have your lovely beans on toast.
Don't tell anyone.
If you do, you'll get them killed.
I'm the Doctor, what's your name?
Rose.
Nice to meet you.
Run for your life!
'Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire.'
I know, it's on the telly!
It's everywhere, she's lucky to be alive.
Honestly, it's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.
You'd think I was her daughter.
Oh, and here's himself.
I've been phoning!
You could have been dead!
It's all on the news!
I can't believe your shop went up!
Honestly, I'm fine.
Don't fuss!
But what happened?
I don't know.
What caused it?
I wasn't in there.
I was outside, I didn't see anything.
It's Debbie.
She knows a man on the Mirror, 500 quid for an interview.
Oh, that's brilliant, give it here.
You've got to find some way to make money.
I'm not bailing you out.
Bev, she's alive!
I've told her, sue for compensation...
She was within seconds of death.
You drinking tea?
That's no good!
You need something stronger.
I'm OK.
You deserve a proper drink.
We're going down the pub.
My treat.
Is there a match on?
...
No, no...
I'm just thinking about you!
There's a match on, ain't there?
We COULD catch the last five minutes.
Go on, then.
I'm fine, really, go.
And get rid of that.
Bye-bye.
Bye!
Aaaggghhh!
'15 fire crews are present, though it's thought there's little chance 'of saving the infrastructure.'
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
You could try them.
They've always got jobs.
Oh, great, the butcher's.
It might be good.
You were getting airs and graces.
I'm not joking about compensation, you've had genuine shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council, just cos the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek!
I know she is Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, you're such a liar!
I said to nail the cat-flap.
We'll get strays!
I did it weeks back.
Na... you thought about it.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
What do you do that for?
Cos I do!
I'm here cos someone blew up my job!
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
Nope, bonehead.
Bye.
You, inside, right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
He's part of the inquiry.
She deserves compensation!
Oh, we're talking millions.
I'm...
I'm in my dressing gown.
Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
..Well, anything could happen.
No.
Don't mind the mess.
Coffee?
Might as well, thanks, just milk.
We should go to the police.
Seriously.
That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you, even if it was some sort of joke...
Sad ending.
It said on the news they found a body. "Rose Tyler."
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!
He was nice.
He was a nice bloke.
Anyway, if we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying.
I want you to explain.
Maybe not.
What's that?
...
Have you got a cat?
No.
We did have, but we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
I told Mickey to chuck that out.
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?
It's all right, I've stopped it.
There.
See... armless!
You think?
!
Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off?
I can.
This is me, swanning off.
But that arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
Well observed.
You can't walk away!
That's not fair.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
No, I don't.
All right, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
Tell me or I'll talk.
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Sort of.
Doesn't work.
Who are you?
Told you, the Doctor.
Yeah, but Doctor what?
Just the Doctor.
The Doctor?
Hello!
Is that meant to sound impressive?
!
Sort of.
Come on then, you can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?
No!
I was just passing.
I'm a long way from home...
But what have I done wrong?
How come those plastic things come after me?
Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you.
You got in the way, that's all.
It tried to kill me!
It was after me, not you!
I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined it all!
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down.
It fixed on you cos you'd met me.
So, you're saying the entire world revolves around you?
Sort of, yeah.
You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah.
All this plastic stuff, who else knows?
No-one.
What, you're on your own?
Well, who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep and watch telly while underneath you, there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
I mean, if we're going with living plastic, and I don't believe that, how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into it.
I cut off the signal.
So, radio control?
Thought control.
You all right?
Yeah.
So... who's controlling it, then?
Long story.
What's it all for?
Shop window dummies, what's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
!
No!
Well, no!
It's not a price war.
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
Do you believe me?
No.
But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor...
Tell me.
Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid.
The first time they tell you the world's turning and you can't believe it cos it looks like everything's standing still.
..I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour.
The entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour.
I can feel it, we're falling through Space, you and me.
Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
H... hey, here's my woman!
Kit off.
Oh, shut up.
Coffee?
Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?
Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom.
Don't read my e-mails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did!
That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.
Dad!
It's one of your nutters.
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive.
Obviously.
I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's in the car, in case you kill me!
No, good point!
No murders!
Who is it?
It's to do with the Doctor, she's been reading the website.
Please come through, I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she?
This is quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it.
People might intercept.
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.
Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just the Doctor.
Always the Doctor.

I fancy a pizza.
Pizza!
Puh-puh-puh.
Pizza!
Or Chinese.
Pizzaaaaaaaa!
Should I try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it then, dishing out chips?
I could do A-levels.
I dunno.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school cos of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
So where did you meet this Doctor?
Oh, sorry, was I talking about me?
I reckon it started at the shop, am I right?
Was he something to do with that?
No.
Come on.
Sort of.
What was he doing there?
I'm not going on about it, really I'm not.
Cos I know it sounds daft, but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
You can trust me, sweetheart.
Babe, darling, sugar...
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning.
I can help you, Rose.
That's all I want, sweetheart, darling, babe, sugar sweetheart.
What are you doing that for?
Champagne.
We didn't order any.
Where's the Doctor?
Madam, your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?
I need know out how much he knows, so where is he?
Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
Look, we didn't order...
Ah, gotcha.
Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway!
Don't think that's gonna stop me.
Everyone, out, now!
Get out, get out, get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing!
Sonic screwdriver.
Use it!
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.
You can't hide in a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
It's gonna follow us.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but a head's perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where d'you want to start?
Um...
The inside's bigger than the outside.
Yes.
It's... alien.
Yep...
Are you alien?
Yes.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
It's called the Tardis, this thing.
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
Happens to the best of us.
Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh, I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend!
You pulled off his head, they copied him, and you didn't even think?
Now you're just gonna let him melt.
Melt?
!
Aw, no, no, no, NO!
What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading!
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!
Almost there, almost there...
Here we go!
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!
I lost the signal.
I got so close.
We've moved.
Does it fly?
It disappears there and reappears here.
But if we're... somewhere else, that headless thing's still on the loose.
Melted with the head.
Are you gonna witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him.
Again!
You were right.
You are alien.
If I did forget some kid called Mickey.
He's not a kid!
..It's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right?
All right?
!
Yes, it is!
If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north?
Lots of planets have a north!
..What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box, from the 1950s.
It's a disguise.
OK.
And, this, this living plastic, what's it got against us?
Nothing.
It loves you.
You've got a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins, perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted.
So.
Earth.
Dinner.
Any way of stopping it?
Antiplastic.
Antiplastic?
Antiplastic!
But first, I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
Hide what?
A transmitter.
The Consciousness is controlling all plastic, a transmitter boosts the signal.
What does it look like?
A transmitter!
Round and massive - in the middle of London.
A huge, metal, circular structure, like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing, it must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think.
Plastic.
Everywhere, every artificial thing waiting to be alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires, cables.
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.
Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach.
Oh, my God.
Mickey!
It's me!
It's OK.
It's all right.
Shhh.
That thing, down there...
The liquid, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
Yeah, that was always a possibility - keep him alive to maintain the copy.
You knew that and never said?
!
Can we keep domestics outside, thank you!
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp, shunt technology.
So, may I suggest, with greatest respect, that you shunt off?
!
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I AM TALKING!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid, little people have just learnt how to walk.
They are capable of so much more.
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go.
Doctor!
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy, I swear.
What do you mean?
No!
Honestly, no...
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true!
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.
What's it doing?
It's the Tardis.
The Nestene's identified it as superior technology.
It's terrified!
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion...
Get out, Rose!
Just leg it!
Mum?
Oh, there you are.
I was gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation.
I've got this document thing off the police.
Don't thank me!
Where are you, Mum?
I'm in town.
Look, go!
Just go home right now.
Darling, you're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit shopping.
I'll see you later, ta-ra.
Mum?
Mum?
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
My God!
I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I've read.
All those stories, it's all true.
Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
RUN!
The stairs have gone.
I haven't got a key...
We're gonna die!
Leave him!
There's nothing you can do!
I've got no A-levels, no job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I have got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s gymnastic team.
I got the bronze!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose, don't go out of the house!
'Lt's not safe.
There are these things, they were shooting and... '
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
You were useless!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I would.
..Thank you.
Right, then!
I'll be off.
Unless...
I dunno.
You could come with me.
This box isn't just a London hopper, you know.
It goes anywhere in the universe.
Free of charge.
Don't!
He's an alien, he's a thing.
He's not invited.
What d'you think?
You could... stay here.
Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go... anywhere.
Is it always this dangerous?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump.
So...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
Thanks.
Thanks for what?
Exactly.
This is the year five billion, and this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
Ooh, I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler.
She's my plus one, is that all right?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
That's not supposed to happen.
Subtitles by Leanne Matheson, BBC Broadcast 2005
- Bye!
- See you later.
Bye!
The store will be closing in five minutes.
Thank you.
Hey!
Wilson?
Wilson, I've got the lottery money.
Wilson.
Are you there?
I can't hang about 'cause they're closing the shop.
Wilson!
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Hello, Wilson.
It's Rose.
Hello?
Wil...
Wilson?
Wilson?
Wilson!
You're kidding me!
Is that someone mucking about?
Who is it?
You got me.
Very funny (!
)
Right, I've got the joke.
Whose idea was this?
Is it Derek's?
Is it?
Derek, is this you?
Run!
- You pulled his arm off!
- Yep.
Plastic.
Nice trick.
Who were they?
- Is it a student thing?
- Why would they be students?
- I don't know.
- You said it.
Why students?
That many people dressed up and being silly.
They gotta be students.
That makes sense.
Well done.
- Thanks.
- They're not students.
Wilson will call the police.
- Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
Wilson's dead.
- That's not funny.
That's sick.
- Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this now.
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there?
I said who are they?
They're living plastic creatures.
They're controlled by a relay device on the roof, which would be a problem if I didn't have this.
I'm going to blow it up, and I might well die in the process, but don't worry about me - go home and have your beans on toast.
If you tell anyone about this, you'll get them killed.
- I'm the Doctor.
You are?
- Rose.
Nice to meet you, Rose.
Run for your life!
Watch it!
Police investigate a fire in Central London.
I know.
It's on the telly.
It's everywhere.
She's lucky to be alive!
It's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.
You'd think I was HER daughter.
Here's himself.
I've been phoning your mobile.
You could have been dead.
I can't believe the shop went up!
I'm fine.
Don't make a fuss.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- What caused it?
- I wasn't in the shop.
I didn't see anything.
Debbie knows a man on the "Mirror".
500 quid for an interview.
Brilliant.
Give it here.
You've got to find some way of making money.
I'm not bailing you out.
Bev!
She's alive!
I've told her.
Sue for compensation.
She was within seconds of death!
- Is that tea?
You need something stronger.
- I'm all right.
You deserve a proper drink.
- Let's go down the pub.
- Is there a match on?
- No!
I'm just thinking about you.
- There's a match on.
- We could catch the last five minutes.
- Go on, then.
I'm fine.
Go.
Get rid of that.
- Bye!
- Bye.
It's thought there's very little chance of saving the infrastructure.
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've got no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
- They've always got jobs.
- Oh, great.
The butcher's (!
)
It might do you good.
That shop gave you airs and graces.
I mean it about compensation.
You've had shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council 'cause the old man at the desk said she looked Greek.
She IS Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, I told you to nail that cat flap down.
We're gonna get strays.
- I did it weeks back!
- You thought about it.
What are you doing here?
- I live here.
- What for?
'Cause I do.
I'm only here 'cause someone blew up my job.
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
No, bonehead.
Bye, then.
Inside.
Right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
Give us ten minutes.
She deserves compensation.
Oh, we're talking millions!
Um...
- I'm in my dressing gown.
- Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
Well, anything could happen.
No.
- Don't mind the mess.
Do you want a coffee?
- Might as well, thanks.
Just milk.
- We should go to the police.
Seriously.
- That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you.
- Even if it was a joke that went wrong.
- Hmm.
Sad ending.
- It said on the news they found a body.
- "Rose Tyler."
Ah!
Could have been worse.
Look at the ears!
- He was a nice bloke.
- # Luck be a lady... #
If we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying.
I want you to explain everything.
Maybe not!
What's that, then?
- Have you got a cat?
- No.
We did have, but now we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
I told Mickey to chuck that out.
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand (!
)
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?
Agh!
I've stopped it.
See?
- 'Armless (!
)
- Do you think?
- You can't just go swanning off!
- Yes, I can.
This is me swanning off.
- That arm tried to kill me!
- Well observed.
You can't just walk away.
- You've got to tell me what's going on.
- No, I don't.
All right.
I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said if I did that, I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
- Tell me or I'll start talking.
- Is that supposed to sound tough?
- Sort of.
- It doesn't work.
- Who are you?
- Told you.
The Doctor.
- Doctor what?
- Just the Doctor.
- The Doctor?
- Hello!
- Is that supposed to sound impressive?
- Sort of.
Come on.
You can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?
No!
I was just passing through.
I'm a long way from home.
What have I done wrong?
Why are those plastic things after me?
Suddenly the entire world revolves around you (!
) You just got in the way.
It tried to kill me.
It was after me, not you.
I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined the whole thing.
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down.
It only fixed on you 'cause you met me.
So you're saying the entire world revolves around you.
- Sort of, yeah.
- You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah!
All this plastic stuff - who else knows about it?
- No one.
- What, you're on your own?
Who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, go to bed and watch telly, while underneath you there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
If we're going with the living plastic
- I don't even believe that - how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into the arm.
I cut off the signal.
- So that's radio control?
- Thought control.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
- So who's controlling it, then?
- Long story.
What's it all for?
I mean, shop window dummies.
What's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
No!
- Well, no.
- It's not a price war!
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
Do you believe me?
- No.
- But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor...
tell me.
Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying about the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid and they tell you that the world's turning, but everything looks like it's standing still.
I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet spinning at 1,000 miles an hour, and the entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67,000 miles an hour, and I can feel it.
We're falling through space, you and me, clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
- Hey-hey!
Here's my woman.
Kit off!
- Shut up.
- Coffee?
- Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
- Not rinse, wash.
Can I use your computer?
- Yeah.
Any excuse to get in the bedroom!
Don't read my emails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe.
He's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did.
That's exactly what an internet murderer would say!
Hello.
I've come to see Clive.
We've been emailing.
Dad!
One of your nutters!
Oh, sorry.
Hello.
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive, obviously.
My boyfriend's waiting in the car - just in case you're gonna kill me (!
)
Good point.
No murders!
- Who is it?
- It's to do with the Doctor.
She's been reading the website.
Come through.
I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read the website about the Doctor and she's a she?
A lot of this stuff's quite sensitive.
I couldn't just send it to you.
People might intercept it.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor crops up all over the place... political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just "the Doctor" - always "the Doctor".
And the title seems to be passed down from father to son - an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there.
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive last year.
That photo's enhanced.
This is the original.
November 22nd 1963.
The assassination of President Kennedy.
- It must be his father.
- Going further back...
April 1912.
This is the Daniels family of Southampton and friend.
This was taken the day before they were due to sail on the Titanic.
For some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip and survived.
Here we are... 1883.
Another Doctor.
Look - the same lineage.
It's identical.
This one washed up on the coast of Sumatra the night that Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings a storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, then one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on, then!
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... then God help you!
Agh!
Who is he?
Who do you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter!
Off his head.
A complete online conspiracy freak.
You win.
What are we gonna do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
- Pizza!
Puh-puh-pizza!
- Or a Chinese.
Pizza!
Do you think I should try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it, then - dishing out chips?
I could do A levels.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school 'cause of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
- Where did you meet this Doctor?
- Sorry.
Did I talk about me then (?
)
It started at the shop, right?
Was he something to do with that?
- No.
- Come on.
Sort of.
- What was he doing there?
- I'm not going on about it, Mickey.
I'm not.
I know it sounds daft but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
- You can trust me, sweetheart.
- Babe.
Sugar.
Tell me what the Doctor's planning and I can help you, Rose.
- That's all I really want to do, sweetheart.
- Babe.
Sugar.
Sweetheart.
What are you doing?
- Your champagne.
- We didn't order it.
- Where's the Doctor?
- Your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what's wrong?
I need to find out how much he knows.
- Don't you want champagne?
- We didn't order it.
- Ah!
Gotcha!
- Don't mind me.
Just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway...
That's not gonna stop me.
Everyone out now!
Get out!
Get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing.
- Sonic screwdriver.
- Use it!
Nah.
Let's go in here.
You can't hide inside a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
He's gonna follow us!
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried.
You see, the arm was too simple, but the head is perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where do you want to start?
The inside is bigger than the outside.
- Yes.
- It's alien.
Yep.
Are you alien?
Yes.
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.
It's called the Tardis.
T-A-R-D-I-S.
Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
- Happens to the best of us.
- Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh.
I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend.
You pulled off his head.
They copied him and you didn't even think?
- And now you're just gonna let him melt?
- Melt?
- No, no, no!
- What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading.
No, no!
Almost there.
Here we go.
You can't go out there.
It's not safe.
I lost the signal.
I got so close!
- We've moved.
Does it fly?
- Disappears there and reappears here.
What about that headless thing?
It's still on the loose.
- It melted with the head.
Stop wittering on.
- I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead.
You forgot him again!
- You were right.
You ARE alien.
- If I did forget some kid, it's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape on this planet, all right?
- All right.
- Yes, it is!
- Why do you sound like you're from the north?
- Lots of planets have a north.
What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box from the 1950s.
- It's a disguise.
- OK.
- This living plastic, what's it got against us?
- Nothing.
It loves you.
You have a great planet.
Lots of smoke and oil, toxins and dioxins in the air.
Perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed.
- Its protein planets rotted, so Earth - dinner!
- Can you stop it?
- Antiplastic.
- Antiplastic?
First I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big?
- What?
- The transmitter.
The Consciousness controls the plastic.
The transmitter boosts the signal.
- What does it look like?

Slap bang in the middle of London.
A huge metal circular structure.
Like a wheel.
Close to where we're standing.
Must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think of it - plastic all over the world.
Everything coming alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires.
- The cables...
- The breast implants.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it inside the vat.

That thing down there - the liquid, Rose - it can talk!
You're stinking!

Agh!
Agh!
- No!
- Time Lord!
Just leave him!
- There's nothing you can do!
- I've got no A levels.
No job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I HAVE got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s Gymnastics Team.
I've got the bronze.
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose!
Don't go out of the house.

- These things were shooting...
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
- Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
- You were useless in there.
- You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
- Yes, I would.
Thank you.
Right, then, I'll be off... unless...
I don't know...
You could come with me.
This box goes anywhere in the universe free of charge.
Don't.
He's an alien.
He's a thing!

- Yeah.
Yeah, I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum, and someone's got to look after this stupid lump, so...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
- Thanks.
- Thanks for what?
Exactly!
This is the year five billion.
And this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the Doctor.
This is Rose Tyler, my "plus one", OK?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have trees.
The Moxx of Balhoon.
The Face of Boe.
The last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare!
Look how thin I am!
ALARM CLOCK BUZZES
Bye.
See you later.
'This is a customer announcement.
The store closes in five minutes.'
Oi!
Wilson?
I've got the lottery money.
Wilson?
You there?
I can't hang about cos they're closing the shop.
Wilson?
(Oh, come on.)
SOMETHING BANGS Hello?
Hello?
Wilson, it's Rose.
Hello?
W...
Wilson?
Wilson!
Wilson?
DOOR SLAMS SHUT
(Oh, you're kidding me!
)
SOMETHING BANGS
Is that someone mucking about?
Who is it?
OK.
You got me.
Very funny.
Right, I've got the joke!
Whose idea was this?
Is it Derek's?
Is it?
Derek, is this you?
Run!
You pulled his arm off!
Yep, plastic.
Very clever, nice trick.
Who are they, students?
A student thing?
Why would they be students?
I don't know!
You said it.
Why students?
Cos... that many people dressed up and being silly has to be students.
That makes sense.
Well done.
Thanks.
They're not students.
When Wilson finds them, he'll call the police.
- Who's Wilson?
- Chief electrician.
- Wilson's dead.
That's just not funny.
That's sick!
Mind your eyes.
I've had enough of this.
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there...?
I said WHO are they?
They're living plastic creatures.
They're being controlled by a relay device from the roof, which would be a great big problem
IF I didn't have this.
So I'm gonna go upstairs and blow it up.
I might well die, but don't worry(!
)
You go home.
Go and have your lovely beans on toast.
Don't tell anyone.
If you do, you'll get them killed.
I'm the Doctor, what's your name?
Rose.
Nice to meet you.
Run for your life!
TV: 'Central London has been closed off as police investigate the fire.'
I know, it's on the telly!
It's everywhere, she's lucky to be alive.
Honestly, it's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.
You'd think I was her daughter.
Oh, and here's himself.
I've been phoning!
You could have been dead!
It's all on the news!
I can't believe your shop went up!
Honestly, I'm fine.
Don't fuss!
But what happened?
I don't know.
What caused it?
I wasn't in there.
I was outside, I didn't see anything.
It's Debbie.
She knows a man on the Mirror, 500 quid for an interview.
Oh, that's brilliant, give it here.
You've got to find some way to make money.
I'm not bailing you out.
PHONE RINGS
Bev, she's alive!
I've told her, sue for compensation...
She was within seconds of death.
You drinking tea?
That's no good!
You need something stronger.
I'm OK.
You deserve a proper drink.
We're going down the pub.
My treat.
Is there a match on?
...
No, no...
I'm just thinking about you!
There's a match on, ain't there?
We COULD catch the last five minutes.
Go on, then.
I'm fine, really, go.
And get rid of that.
Bye-bye.
Bye!
Aaaggghhh!
'15 fire crews are present, though it's thought there's little chance 'of saving the infrastructure.'
ALARM CLOCK BUZZES
There's no point in getting up, sweetheart.
You've no job to go to.
There's Finch's.
You could try them.
They've always got jobs.
Oh, great, the butcher's.
It might be good.
You were getting airs and graces.
I'm not joking about compensation, you've had genuine shock and trauma.
Arianna got 2,000 quid off the council, just cos the old man behind the desk said she looked Greek!
I know she is Greek, but that's not the point.
It was a valid claim.
Mum, you're such a liar!
I said to nail the cat-flap.
We'll get strays!
I did it weeks back.
Na... you thought about it.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
What do you do that for?
Cos I do!
I'm here cos someone blew up my job!
I must have the wrong signal.
You're not plastic, are you?
Nope, bonehead.
Bye.
You, inside, right now.
Who is it?
It's about last night.
He's part of the inquiry.
She deserves compensation!
Oh, we're talking millions.
I'm...
I'm in my dressing gown.
Yes, you are.
There's a strange man in my bedroom.
Yes, there is.
..Well, anything could happen.
No.
Don't mind the mess.
Coffee?
Might as well, thanks, just milk.
We should go to the police.
Seriously.
That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.
I'm not blaming you, even if it was some sort of joke...
Sad ending.
It said on the news they found a body. "Rose Tyler."
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!
He was nice.
He was a nice bloke.
Anyway, if we do go to the police, I wanna know what I'm saying.
I want you to explain.
Maybe not.
FLAPPING SOUND What's that?
...
Have you got a cat?
No.
We did have, but we just get strays.
They come in off the estate.
I told Mickey to chuck that out.
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...
Anyway, I don't even know your name.
Doctor what?
It's all right, I've stopped it.
There.
See... armless!
You think?
!
Hold on a minute, you can't just go swanning off?
I can.
This is me, swanning off.
But that arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
Well observed.
You can't walk away!
That's not fair.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
No, I don't.
All right, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
Tell me or I'll talk.
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Sort of.
Doesn't work.
Who are you?
Told you, the Doctor.
Yeah, but Doctor what?
Just the Doctor.
The Doctor?
Hello!
Is that meant to sound impressive?
!
Sort of.
Come on then, you can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?
No!
I was just passing.
I'm a long way from home...
But what have I done wrong?
How come those plastic things come after me?
Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you.
You got in the way, that's all.
It tried to kill me!
It was after me, not you!
I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined it all!
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down.
It fixed on you cos you'd met me.
So, you're saying the entire world revolves around you?
Sort of, yeah.
You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah.
All this plastic stuff, who else knows?
No-one.
What, you're on your own?
Well, who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep and watch telly while underneath you, there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
I mean, if we're going with living plastic, and I don't believe that, how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into it.
I cut off the signal.
So, radio control?
Thought control.
You all right?
Yeah.
So... who's controlling it, then?
Long story.
What's it all for?
Shop window dummies, what's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
!
No!
Well, no!
It's not a price war.
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
Do you believe me?
No.
But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor...
Tell me.
Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid.
The first time they tell you the world's turning and you can't believe it cos it looks like everything's standing still.
..I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour.
The entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour.
I can feel it, we're falling through Space, you and me.
Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
STRANGE MACHINE-LIKE NOISE
H... hey, here's my woman!
Kit off.
Oh, shut up.
Coffee?
Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?
Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom.
Don't read my e-mails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did!
That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.
Dad!
It's one of your nutters.
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive.
Obviously.
I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's in the car, in case you kill me!
No, good point!
No murders!
Who is it?
It's to do with the Doctor, she's been reading the website.
Please come through, I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she?
This is quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it.
People might intercept.
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.
Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just the Doctor.
Always the Doctor.
The title seems to be passed from father to son, like an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive, last year.
The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original...
November 22nd 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy.
See.
Must be his father.
Going further back...
April 1912, this is a photograph of the Daniels family of Southampton, and friend...
Taken the day before they were due to go to the new world.
On the Titanic.
But for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip, and survived.
And here we are... 1883, another Doctor.
Look, the same lineage, he's identical...
This one washed up on the Sumatran coast, the night Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend, woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings the storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on then.
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... ..then God help you.
BIN ROARS
BIN BURPS But who is he?
Who d'you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.
Complete online conspiracy freak, you win!
So, what are we going to do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
Pizza!
Puh-puh-puh.
Pizza!
Or Chinese.
Pizzaaaaaaaa!
Should I try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it then, dishing out chips?
I could do A-levels.
I dunno.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school cos of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
So where did you meet this Doctor?
Oh, sorry, was I talking about me?
I reckon it started at the shop, am I right?
Was he something to do with that?
No.
Come on.
Sort of.
What was he doing there?
I'm not going on about it, really I'm not.
Cos I know it sounds daft, but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
You can trust me, sweetheart.
HIS VOICE IS ROBOTIC AT TURNS Babe, darling, sugar...
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning.
I can help you, Rose.
That's all I want, sweetheart, darling, babe, sugar sweetheart.
What are you doing that for?
Champagne.
We didn't order any.
Where's the Doctor?
Madam, your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?
I need know out how much he knows, so where is he?
Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
Look, we didn't order...
Ah, gotcha.
Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway!
Don't think that's gonna stop me.
Everyone, out, now!
Get out, get out, get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing!
Sonic screwdriver.
Use it!
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.
You can't hide in a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
It's gonna follow us.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but a head's perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where d'you want to start?
Um...
The inside's bigger than the outside.
Yes.
It's... alien.
Yep...
Are you alien?
Yes.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
It's called the Tardis, this thing.
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
Happens to the best of us.
Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh, I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend!
You pulled off his head, they copied him, and you didn't even think?
Now you're just gonna let him melt.
Melt?
!
Aw, no, no, no, NO!
What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading!
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!
Almost there, almost there...
Here we go!
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!
I lost the signal.
I got so close.
We've moved.
Does it fly?
It disappears there and reappears here.
But if we're... somewhere else, that headless thing's still on the loose.
Melted with the head.
Are you gonna witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him.
Again!
You were right.
You are alien.
If I did forget some kid called Mickey.
He's not a kid!
..It's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right?
All right?
!
Yes, it is!
If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north?
Lots of planets have a north!
..What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box, from the 1950s.
It's a disguise.
OK.
And, this, this living plastic, what's it got against us?
Nothing.
It loves you.
You've got a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins, perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted.
So.
Earth.
Dinner.
Any way of stopping it?
Antiplastic.
Antiplastic?
Antiplastic!
But first, I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
Hide what?
A transmitter.
The Consciousness is controlling all plastic, a transmitter boosts the signal.
What does it look like?
A transmitter!
Round and massive - in the middle of London.
A huge, metal, circular structure, like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing, it must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think.
Plastic.
Everywhere, every artificial thing waiting to be alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires, cables.
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.
Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach.
Oh, my God.
Mickey!
It's me!
It's OK.
It's all right.
Shhh.
That thing, down there...
The liquid, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
Yeah, that was always a possibility - keep him alive to maintain the copy.
You knew that and never said?
!
Can we keep domestics outside, thank you!
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp, shunt technology.
So, may I suggest, with greatest respect, that you shunt off?
!
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I AM TALKING!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid, little people have just learnt how to walk.
They are capable of so much more.
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go.
Doctor!
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy, I swear.
What do you mean?
No!
Honestly, no...
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true!
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.
What's it doing?
It's the Tardis.
The Nestene's identified it as superior technology.
It's terrified!
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion...
Get out, Rose!
Just leg it!
Mum?
Oh, there you are.
I was gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation.
I've got this document thing off the police.
Don't thank me!
Where are you, Mum?
I'm in town.
Look, go!
Just go home right now.
Darling, you're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit shopping.
I'll see you later, ta-ra.
Mum?
Mum?
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
My God!
I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I've read.
All those stories, it's all true.
Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
RUN!
The stairs have gone.
I haven't got a key...
We're gonna die!
Leave him!
There's nothing you can do!
I've got no A-levels, no job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I have got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s gymnastic team.
I got the bronze!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose, don't go out of the house!
'Lt's not safe.
There are these things, they were shooting and... '
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
You were useless!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I would.
..Thank you.
Right, then!
I'll be off.
Unless...
I dunno.
You could come with me.
This box isn't just a London hopper, you know.
It goes anywhere in the universe.
Free of charge.
Don't!
He's an alien, he's a thing.
He's not invited.
What d'you think?
You could... stay here.
Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go... anywhere.
Is it always this dangerous?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump.
So...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
Thanks.
Thanks for what?
Exactly.
This is the year five billion, and this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
Ooh, I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler.
She's my plus one, is that all right?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
That's not supposed to happen.

But that arm was moving, it tried to kill me!
Well observed.
You can't walk away!
That's not fair.
You've got to tell me what's going on.
No, I don't.
All right, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell everyone.
You said I'd get people killed, so, your choice.
Tell me or I'll talk.
Is that supposed to sound tough?
Sort of.
Doesn't work.
Who are you?
Told you, the Doctor.
Yeah, but Doctor what?
Just the Doctor.
The Doctor?
Hello!
Is that meant to sound impressive?
!
Sort of.
Come on then, you can tell me.
I've seen enough.
Are you the police?
No!
I was just passing.
I'm a long way from home...
But what have I done wrong?
How come those plastic things come after me?
Oh, suddenly the entire world revolves around you.
You got in the way, that's all.
It tried to kill me!
It was after me, not you!
I was in the shop, you blundered in, almost ruined it all!
I was tracking it down, it was tracking me down.
It fixed on you cos you'd met me.
So, you're saying the entire world revolves around you?
Sort of, yeah.
You're full of it!
Sort of, yeah.
All this plastic stuff, who else knows?
No-one.
What, you're on your own?
Well, who else is there?
I mean, you lot, all you do is eat chips, sleep and watch telly while underneath you, there's a war going on.
OK.
Start from the beginning.
I mean, if we're going with living plastic, and I don't believe that, how did you kill it?
The thing controlling it projects life into it.
I cut off the signal.
So, radio control?
Thought control.
You all right?
Yeah.
So... who's controlling it, then?
Long story.
What's it all for?
Shop window dummies, what's that about?
Is someone trying to take over Britain's shops?
!
No!
Well, no!
It's not a price war.
They want to overthrow the human race and destroy you.
Do you believe me?
No.
But you're still listening.
Really, though, Doctor...
Tell me.
Who are you?
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?
It's like when you're a kid.
The first time they tell you the world's turning and you can't believe it cos it looks like everything's standing still.
..I can feel it.
The turn of the Earth.
The ground beneath our feet is spinning at 1, 000 miles an hour.
The entire planet is hurtling round the sun at 67, 000 miles an hour.
I can feel it, we're falling through Space, you and me.
Clinging to the skin of this tiny little world, and if we let go...
That's who I am.
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.
Go home.
STRANGE MACHINE-LIKE NOISE
H... hey, here's my woman!
Kit off.
Oh, shut up.
Coffee?
Yeah, only if you wash the mug.
I don't mean rinse, I mean wash.
Can I use your computer?
Yeah, any excuse to get in the bedroom.
Don't read my e-mails!
You're not coming in.
He's safe, he's got a wife and kids.
Who told you that?
He did!
That's exactly what an internet lunatic murderer would say.
Um, hello, I've come to see Clive.
We've been e-mailing.
Dad!
It's one of your nutters.
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose.
I'm Clive.
Obviously.
I'd better tell you - my boyfriend's in the car, in case you kill me!
No, good point!
No murders!
Who is it?
It's to do with the Doctor, she's been reading the website.
Please come through, I'm in the shed.
She?
She's read a website about the Doctor, she's a she?
This is quite sensitive, I couldn't just send it.
People might intercept.
If you know what I mean.
If you dig deep enough and keep a lively mind, this Doctor keeps cropping up all over the place.
Political diaries, conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.
No first name, no last name, just the Doctor.
Always the Doctor.
The title seems to be passed from father to son, like an inheritance.
That's your Doctor there, isn't it?
Yeah.
I tracked it down to the Washington Public Archive, last year.
The online photo's enhanced, but if we look at the original...
November 22nd 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy.
See.
Must be his father.
Going further back...
April 1912, this is a photograph of the Daniels family of Southampton, and friend...
Taken the day before they were due to go to the new world.
On the Titanic.
But for some unknown reason, they cancelled the trip, and survived.
And here we are... 1883, another Doctor.
Look, the same lineage, he's identical...
This one washed up on the Sumatran coast, the night Krakatoa exploded.
The Doctor is a legend, woven throughout history.
When disaster comes, he's there.
He brings the storm in his wake, and has one constant companion.
Who's that?
Death.
If the Doctor's back, if you've seen him, Rose, one thing's for certain.
We're all in danger.
Come on then.
If he singled you out, if the Doctor's making house calls... ..then God help you.
BIN ROARS
BIN BURPS But who is he?
Who d'you think he is?
I think he's the same man.
I think he's immortal.
I think he's an alien from another world.
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.
Complete online conspiracy freak, you win!
So, what are we going to do tonight?
I fancy a pizza.
Pizza!
Puh-puh-puh.
Pizza!
Or Chinese.
Pizzaaaaaaaa!
Should I try the hospital?
Suki said they had jobs going in the canteen.
Is that it then, dishing out chips?
I could do A-levels.
I dunno.
It's all Jimmy Stones's fault.
I only left school cos of him and look where he ended up.
What do you think?
So where did you meet this Doctor?
Oh, sorry, was I talking about me?
I reckon it started at the shop, am I right?
Was he something to do with that?
No.
Come on.
Sort of.
What was he doing there?
I'm not going on about it, really I'm not.
Cos I know it sounds daft, but I don't think he's safe.
He's dangerous.
You can trust me, sweetheart.
HIS VOICE IS ROBOTIC AT TURNS Babe, darling, sugar...
You can tell me anything.
Tell me about the Doctor and what he's planning.
I can help you, Rose.
That's all I want, sweetheart, darling, babe, sugar sweetheart.
What are you doing that for?
Champagne.
We didn't order any.
Where's the Doctor?
Madam, your champagne.
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?
I need know out how much he knows, so where is he?
Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
Look, we didn't order...
Ah, gotcha.
Don't mind me.
I'm just toasting the happy couple.
On the house!
Anyway!
Don't think that's gonna stop me.
Everyone, out, now!
Get out, get out, get out!
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing!
Sonic screwdriver.
Use it!
Nah, tell you what, let's go in here.
You can't hide in a wooden box!
He's gonna get us!
Doctor!
It's gonna follow us.
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan couldn't get through that door.
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.
You see, the arm was too simple, but a head's perfect.
I can use it to trace the signal back to the original source.
Right.
Where d'you want to start?
Um...
The inside's bigger than the outside.
Yes.
It's... alien.
Yep...
Are you alien?
Yes.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
It's called the Tardis, this thing.
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And Relative Dimension In Space.
That's OK.
Culture shock.
Happens to the best of us.
Did they kill him?
Mickey?
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?
Oh, I didn't think of that.
He's my boyfriend!
You pulled off his head, they copied him, and you didn't even think?
Now you're just gonna let him melt.
Melt?
!
Aw, no, no, no, NO!
What are you doing?
Following the signal.
It's fading!
No, no, no, no, no, no, NO!
Almost there, almost there...
Here we go!
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!
I lost the signal.
I got so close.
We've moved.
Does it fly?
It disappears there and reappears here.
But if we're... somewhere else, that headless thing's still on the loose.
Melted with the head.
Are you gonna witter on all night?
I'll have to tell his mother.
Mickey.
I'll have to tell his mother he's dead, and you just went and forgot him.
Again!
You were right.
You are alien.
If I did forget some kid called Mickey.
He's not a kid!
..It's because I'm trying to save every stupid ape blundering about on this planet, all right?
All right?
!
Yes, it is!
If you are an alien, why do you sound like you're from the north?
Lots of planets have a north!
..What's a police public call box?
It's a telephone box, from the 1950s.
It's a disguise.
OK.
And, this, this living plastic, what's it got against us?
Nothing.
It loves you.
You've got a good planet, lots of smoke and oil, plenty of toxins and dioxins, perfect.
Just what the Nestene Consciousness needs.
Its food stock was destroyed in the war, its protein planets rotted.
So.
Earth.
Dinner.
Any way of stopping it?
Antiplastic.
Antiplastic?
Antiplastic!
But first, I've got to find it.
How can you hide something that big in a city this small?
Hide what?
A transmitter.
The Consciousness is controlling all plastic, a transmitter boosts the signal.
What does it look like?
A transmitter!
Round and massive - in the middle of London.
A huge, metal, circular structure, like a dish, like a wheel, radial, close to where we're standing, it must be completely invisible.
What?
What?
What is it?
What?
Oh.
Fantastic!
Think.
Plastic.
Everywhere, every artificial thing waiting to be alive.
The shop window dummies, phones, wires, cables.
The breast implants.
Still, we've found the transmitter.
The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.
What about down here?
Looks good to me.
The Nestene Consciousness.
That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.
Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go.
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.
I seek audience with the Nestene Consciousness under peaceful contract according to Convention 15 of the Shadow Proclamation.
Thank you.
If I might have permission to approach.
Oh, my God.
Mickey!
It's me!
It's OK.
It's all right.
Shhh.
That thing, down there...
The liquid, it can talk!
Oh, you're stinking!
Doctor, they kept him alive!
Yeah, that was always a possibility - keep him alive to maintain the copy.
You knew that and never said?
!
Can we keep domestics outside, thank you!
Am I addressing the Consciousness?
Thank you.
If I might observe, you infiltrated this civilisation by means of warp, shunt technology.
So, may I suggest, with greatest respect, that you shunt off?
!
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.
Don't talk about constitutional rights.
I AM TALKING!
This planet is just starting.
These stupid, little people have just learnt how to walk.
They are capable of so much more.
I'm asking you, on their behalf.
Please, just go.
Doctor!
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.
I'm not your enemy, I swear.
What do you mean?
No!
Honestly, no...
Yes, that's my ship.
That's not true!
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war.
It wasn't my fault.
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.
What's it doing?
It's the Tardis.
The Nestene's identified it as superior technology.
It's terrified!
It's going to the final base.
It's starting the invasion...
Get out, Rose!
Just leg it!
Mum?
Oh, there you are.
I was gonna phone.
You CAN get compensation.
I've got this document thing off the police.
Don't thank me!
Where are you, Mum?
I'm in town.
Look, go!
Just go home right now.
Darling, you're breaking up.
I'm just gonna do a bit shopping.
I'll see you later, ta-ra.
Mum?
Mum?
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.
It's the end of the world.
There's no point in a spreadsheet if you spend summer money in winter.
My God!
I thought they were dummies!
I nearly had a heart attack.
It's true.
Everything I've read.
All those stories, it's all true.
Get out, Rose!
Just get out!
RUN!
The stairs have gone.
I haven't got a key...
We're gonna die!
Leave him!
There's nothing you can do!
I've got no A-levels, no job.
No future.
But I'll tell you what I have got.
Jericho Street Junior School Under-7s gymnastic team.
I got the bronze!
Rose!
Now we're in trouble!
Rose, don't go out of the house!
'Lt's not safe.
There are these things, they were shooting and... '
Hello?
Fat lot of good you were!
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!
You were useless!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.
Yes, I would.
..Thank you.
Right, then!
I'll be off.
Unless...
I dunno.
You could come with me.
This box isn't just a London hopper, you know.
It goes anywhere in the universe.
Free of charge.
Don't!
He's an alien, he's a thing.
He's not invited.
What d'you think?
You could... stay here.
Fill your life with work and food and sleep, or you could go... anywhere.
Is it always this dangerous?
Yeah.
Yeah...
I can't.
I've got to go and find my mum and someone's got to look after this stupid lump.
So...
OK.
See you around.
Come on, let's go.
By the way, did I mention it also travels in time?
Thanks.
Thanks for what?
Exactly.
This is the year five billion, and this is the day...
Hold on...
Welcome to the end of the world.
Who the hell are you?
Ooh, I'm The Doctor this is Rose Tyler.
She's my plus one, is that all right?
Representing the Forest of Cheam, we have Trees, the Moxx of Balhoon, the Face of Boe, the last human - the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.
Oh, now, don't stare, look how thin I am.
That's not supposed to happen.
Subtitles by Leanne Matheson, BBC Broadcast 2005
You okay?
Thanks.
I...
I know you, right?
We... had a class together?
Oh, actually, we've had, like, five classes together.
I better get back in.
Whoa.
I feel so dizzy.
Come on.
It has been three days since the disappearance of Amy Flynn.
Friends and family have launched an all-out search for the 21-year-old senior.
Last night, they gathered to pray for Amy's safe return.
Amy's mother, Mary Flynn, had this message for her missing daughter.
Amy, if you can hear me:
we love you, baby.
Try to be strong.
And I just want to say, to whoever did this:
Please, please just let our daughter come home.
Police have focused their investigation on this man-- Derrick Adler.
Sources say Amy was last seen leaving a campus party with Adler.
Officers have searched the 21-year-old suspect's car, but are not saying what they found.
Jackpot.
Branch, look at this.
He's got over a hundred shots here.
In class, the gym, buying groceries...
He's been stalking this girl.
He's got dates, times-- he catalogs every shot.
Arrest him.
This is the guy.
There you are.
I'm not late, Steve.
It's 8:15.
I need you to clear your calendar.
I can't, I have a hearing at 10:00.
Not anymore.
I just got a call from Detective Branch.
He's working the Amy Flynn case.
Please tell me they found her.
Not yet, but they just made an arrest.
Apparently, she was being stalked.
Maureen, what do we know?
Derrick Adler grew up four blocks from Amy.
This isn't an overnight obsession.
The police say he's been secretly hooked on her since they were in grade school.
Does he have any priors?
Nothing.
He's invisible.
Adler's one of those people you never even notice.
Yeah, until he decides to kidnap your daughter.
What about Amy?
What's her story?
She's the kind of girl you want your daughter to grow up to be.
She did nothing to deserve this.
This one's all over the news, which means the DA's all over me.
He'll want progress reports from our department, so, keep me informed.
I'll get someone to cover your 10:00 hearing.
Thanks, Maureen.
Steve, when you free up,
I want to talk to you about how to handle a drunk-driving fatality.
You got it.
Annabeth, this is big time.
The media, the DA, half the planet is watching on this.
Do the police have any idea where she is?
None.
Look, you know how this works.
The chances of finding a kidnap victim drop significantly after the first 48 hours.
This girl's been gone for 72.
Got it.
They could end up searching for months-- digging up fields, draining lakes.
I'll call you from the precinct.
Annabeth, if we have to search, that girl is dead.
We need to know where she is now.
You need to get a confession.
Captioning sponsored by CBS and WARNER BROS.
TELEVISION
Ms. Chase, can you give us any new developments on the Flynn case?
Anything at all?
Can you tell us the latest?
He's been stalking her for over a year.
Any statements so far?
He denies it.
Said he took her home;
even walked her to the door.
Can we verify that?
Negative.
Pulled the security feed from the dorm.
He was never anywhere near that building.
So he's lying.
And changing his behavior.
The day after Amy disappeared, he suddenly missed all his classes.
Which may give you probable cause to arrest, but I need proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
I know.
Look, I know it's all circumstantial, but I'm telling you, he's holding that girl.
You think she's alive?
I know she is.
I've been in Special Victims for seven years.
I know the type.
No roommate, no girlfriend.
We have evidence of extreme obsession, with no prior record of violence.
Every killer has a first time.
Maybe.
Look at this.
The Collector.
"A tale of obsessive love."
We found it in his apartment.
It's the story of an ordinary guy who kidnaps a girl-- not because he wants to hurt her-- he wants to possess her.
Make her fall in love with him.
Put him in interrogation.
MAUREEN:
Steve, we have a problem.
I picked up a vehicular last night--
A drunk driver hit a young father, then crashed his car into a tree.
The victim died.
How's the driver?
He was taken to the hospital, still unconscious.
Okay, so all you need to do is get a blood test to prove that the driver was drunk.
That's the problem.
I sent Detective Margate to get the tests.
He never did it.
By the time I realized, it was too late.
The alcohol had metabolized in the driver's system.
We lost our only evidence in a homicide.
I don't get it.
Bill Margate is a great detective.
I didn't get it either until I followed up on the driver.
His name is Detective Norman Reed.
The driver was a cop.
16 years on the force.
I think Margate didn't get the test on purpose.
He knew the alcohol would metabolize.
He obstructed justice to save a fellow cop.
Okay, let's not jump the gun.
Bring him in, let him tell us what happened.
I'm Annabeth Chase.
I'm the deputy prosecuting attorney.
What's happening?
Did you find Amy?
Do you know where she is?
We're doing all we can.
The police made an arrest this morning.
Derrick Adler?
Yes.
We heard on the news that he grew up in our neighborhood.
I checked Amy's yearbooks.
They've been in school together since they were kids, but I never heard her mention him.
What's he being charged with?
Nothing yet.
The police arrested him because they think he took Amy.
I think they're right.
But it's my job to decide if there's enough to file formal charges, and right now, we don't have much.
I'm hoping that once we question Derrick...
How long will that take?
Can't be sure.
But if he knows where Amy is, we need to break him in the next eight hours.
If we push him any longer than that, a court might find that he was coerced.
He took our daughter.
I don't give a damn about his rights.
Please, just find Amy.
I told you...
I drove her home.
BRANCH:
That's a lie, Derrick.
You see this?
We pulled the security tape.
Shows the whole front of the building.
Proves you were never there.
Nah, I don't believe you.
You're making that up.
I'm making it up?
What about your computer?
Pictures of Amy at school, pictures of Amy at the gym.
You were stalking this woman.
Look at me!
It's over.
You give us dates, times.
Now, I've been doing this a long time.
I know extreme obsession when I see it.
It's not a crime to take pictures!
We have more than pictures, Derrick.
Why was her sweater still in your car?
Why did you miss classes the next day?
It doesn't wash.
Someone else kidnaps her, on the night you give her the ride home?
A woman you've been stalking for the last year?
I wouldn't hurt her!
I don't know where she is.
Look at those.
Now, I got to say, not smart leaving those around your place:
The Collector, The Perfect Victim...
Now, why would an innocent guy like you be reading about abducting women?
They're just books.
They're more than just books, Derrick.
You were studying up.
You were learning the trade.
Now, we put those books in front of a jury... you're done.
That's it-- he wants to tell us.
It's not too late.
I...
I want...
This is it; he's breaking.
I want a lawyer.
He's playing games.
I thought we had him.
Son of a bitch.
He knows we can't question him now.
He's guilty.
Amy Flynn is alive.
"I wouldn't hurt her." That's what he said.
Not "I didn't hurt her," or "I didn't kill her."
And he never made any reference to a body.
He said he didn't know where she is.
I agree, but he gave us nothing.
Keep him here.
I'll be right back.
It's over.
Where you going?
To talk to Amy's parents.
It's not over until they say it is.
There she is.
Don't get too close, folks.
A shark in her natural habitat.
Close the door.
Hi, Billy.
How are you?
Good, thanks.
You?
Tell me about Norman Reed.
What about him?
You know what I'm asking.
I instructed you to get a blood test.
You did?
I don't remember that.
You deliberately ignored my order.
You obstructed justice to protect another cop.
Take it easy.
I made a mistake.
You don't make mistakes.
I want the truth, Billy.
You're not just a cop.
You are probably the best cop I know.
And, I think, after all these years,
I deserve a straight answer.
On the record...
I made a mistake.
Off the record...
Norman Reed's a friend.
A good detective.
Damn it, Billy.
He's three months away from retirement.
He's got a family.
So you obstructed justice?
He's a friend, Maureen.
He gave his life for the department.
He put a lot of bad people away.
What good's it going to do to lock him up?
It's not going to bring the victim back.
You're a cop.
You enforce the law.
You don't pick and choose who it applies to.
Now you're the one who's not being straight.
We make judgment calls-- that's the job.
Sometimes you look extra hard, sometimes... you look the other way.
Not me.
A man is dead, Billy.
He's dead, and you let his killer go.
Now you look me in the eye and tell me that was part of the job.
What are you going to do?
Arrest me?
Maureen, it's me-
- Billy.
Half the cases you ever won, we won together.
Don't do this.
Mr. Adler asked for a lawyer.
Then don't you have to give him one?
Not exactly.
The law doesn't guarantee him counsel.
We are allowed to deny his request.
But nothing he says, from now on, can ever be used against him.
Then what's the point?
The point is to find your daughter.
We can keep going, but if he tells us where Amy is, his confession can never be used at trial.
A jury will never know about it.
I see.
We would also lose any evidence he leads us to.
Nothing we find would be admissible at trial.
Well, we just want our daughter back.
I know, but I need you to understand the risk.
If we find Amy alive,
I think a court will let her testify to what happened.
So, you could still make a case?
Yes.
The risk is...
in the other possibility.
But you said you think she's alive.
I can't promise that.
Oh, my God.
If Amy is... dead, the case will be destroyed.
Any evidence we find-- hair, fibers, blood-- nothing will be admissible.
And the man who killed your daughter will probably go free.
Why...
You want us to decide?
Yes.
Well, you think you could find her without getting a confession?
I don't know.
Right now, the police are trying, but the search could take weeks.
Months, even.
What if Amy's hurt, what if... she has no food or water?
Well, what would you do?
I also have a daughter.
And if anything ever happened to her,
I would do whatever it took to find her alive.
Then do it.
We trust you.
We're not stopping.
What do you mean?
He asked for a lawyer.
No problem;
I won't use his statement against him.
Whoa, wait a second-- you may be destroying the case.
This case isn't the priority.
Finding that girl .
If Amy's not alive, we're gonna need clean evidence not related to the confession.
Tell your men to focus their work on the days before and after the crime.
Maybe we should get this cleared first.
No, there's no time for that.
We need to get in there now.
Okay.
I'll do it myself.
in the disappearance of college student Amy Flynn, as the search now enters its 75th hour.
He's all yours.
Thanks.
Who are you?
Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Chase.
I'm handling your case.
Yeah, well, you need to talk to your people, because I asked for a lawyer.
Did you hear me?
I want an attorney.
I heard you.
What you don't seem to realize is that I don't care.
You're not getting a lawyer.
You're not getting anything.
In fact, you're not leaving this room until you tell us where to find Amy Flynn.
You can't do that.
Look around, Derrick.
You see anyone trying to stop me?
Hey!
Detective!
Get me out of here!
Are you finished?
You want to arrest him?
I don't have a choice.
He basically admitted everything.
This is Billy Margate.
He's a highly respected detective.
Meaning what?
He can break the law?
Of course not.
But I don't think it's wrong to consider the consequences here.
Like what?
Like Margate has a lot of friends.
If we arrest him, the police could retaliate-- stop showing up for court, ignore our orders.
They won't do that.
Some of them will.
The DA is up for reelection.
The police are a critical support base.
Are we really prepared to alienate our key supporters?
I don't believe this.
Hear me out.
Arresting Margate will cause trouble.
Hearings, headlines...
We could end up in a battle with the very people we need behind us.
We could be putting this entire office in danger.
I thought this office was here to seek justice.
Then, in the interest of justice, let me ask-
- Billy Margate is the lead detective on three pending murder cases.
If we arrest him, we need to disclose that fact.
His credibility will be destroyed.
Are we really prepared to risk putting three killers back on the street for this?
Don't answer me now.
Just think about it.
Whatever you decide, I'll back you up.
Maureen.
I need a few minutes, please.
Sorry, it's about your drunk driving case.
The victim's family's here to see you.
So, what is this, Derrick, revenge?
You went to school with Amy, for all those years, and she never even knew who you were.
Look at this.
Is there a problem?
It's the ink from the fingerprints.
I need to wash my hands.
I can help you with that.
But first, you need to help me.
I'm trying to understand...
Look, you don't know anything about me.
Here's what I know.
If Amy Flynn dies because you sat here inspecting your nails,
I won't rest until you get the death penalty.
Are you ready for that?
Are you willing to risk execution?
I told you.
I wouldn't hurt her.
You are hurting her.
She's out there alone.
That's your fault, not mine.
Are you kidding?
You're holding her hostage and I'm the one responsible?
Yes!
She could be dying, as we speak.
I wouldn't do that!
Look.
I love her, okay?
You have the pictures.
You know that already.
We went to the precinct.
They told me the driver who killed my husband was a detective.
Yes.
They won't give me any more information.
They keep insisting this was an accident.
Mrs. Hayes...
It doesn't make sense.
I saw the intersection.
The lighting is fine...
My husband was in the crosswalk.
Maybe the driver was drinking or fell asleep at the wheel.
As of now,
I don't have any evidence of that.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm a mess.
I just can't believe he's gone.
If you find anything, will you please call me?
Of course.
I'll be in touch with you as soon as I can.
I can't get through to him.
We don't have enough leverage.
What am I supposed to do?
I've been pushing him for the last three hours.
Nothing.
He's enjoying himself.
Look at him.
He's always been awkward, invisible.
For once, he has all the power.
He's getting what he wants.
That's it.
What?
You just said it:
Give him what he wants.
I don't understand.
Maybe the answer isn't to keep pushing him.
Maybe the answer is to stop pushing him.
Okay, Derrick, you win.
What?
It's over.
You want a lawyer,
I'll have the court arrange for counsel.
Don't bother.
I'll get my own as soon as I get out of here.
Oh, you're not going anywhere.
Derrick Adler, you're being charged with the abduction of Amy Flynn.
You'll get a lawyer for your arraignment in 72 hours.
You don't have enough to charge me.
Maybe, maybe not.
I say we let the judge decide.
Of course, legally,
I don't have to produce you in court for another three days.
Wait!
I'm done waiting.
You're making a mistake.
Get him out of here.
Would you just listen to me a second?
I'm listening.
If I don't get out of here, Amy will die, do you get that?
So she is alive.
Yes!
But she won't survive another three days on her own.
Then you have a decision to make.
You tell us where she is, or you let her die.
No, you're bluffing.
I have nothing to lose.
Detective.
You're killing her!
No, you are.
You say you love her, Derrick.
How much?
Are you ready to kill her?
Are you willing to be the reason she died?
Okay.
Okay.
There's a place up north about two miles from the highway.
This is it!
Get the bolt cutters!
Got it!
We got her.
Get a medic!
I got a pulse!
She's alive!
Nice work, counselor.
My work just started.
A harrowing end to the search for missing coed Amy Flynn.
She was found here, alive, locked in this storage facility for days.
Is it true?
What?
You know what.
You questioned Eric Adler after he requested a lawyer.
Yes.
Annabeth...
I had to, Steve.
It was the only way to find her alive.
I just got a call from Detective Branch's supervisor.
They have Derrick's prints at the scene.
His skin cells under Amy's fingernails.
They have hair, saliva.
I know.
It's all inadmissible.
Derrick Adler abducted that girl and he's about to be a free man!
Amy Flynn is alive
She's in a hospital right now, not in some storage locker we never would have found.
And thank God for that.
I did what was necesary, Steve.
Then why didn't you call me?
I didn't have time.
You couldn't find three minutes?
I was afraid to, okay?
You want the truth.
Fine.
I didn't ask for your permission because I wasn't sure you would give it to me.
You're right.
I wouldn't gamble my entire case without knowing the victim was alive.
I took a risk.
You can't just take a risk!
You and Maureen both need to learn that you are not alone here.
You work for this office.
Our boss is an elected official, that means we discuss what we do.
If that girl had died, this would be a scandal.
Every paper in the country would be printing how this office set a killer free.
Your career would be over.
My career as a supervisor would be over--
I'm sorry!
I thought she was alive and I wasn't about to leave her out there because I was worried about our careers!
I should have called, but I did not destroy the case.
We still have Amy's testimony.
I need witnesses who saw the impact.
No, I'm trying to prove he was drunk.
Ask the bartender how many drinks he had.
Okay, thank you.
Everything okay?
In this office?
Never.
Can I help you?
Inspector Gordon Tuft, Internal Affairs.
Maureen Scofield.
So... have you had an affair with anyone internal?
That's just a joke.
Sorry.
Some people get a little tense when IA comes around.
Breaks the ice.
Right, well, just conducting a routine inquiry as I'm sure you're aware.
Detective Norman Reed was involved in a fatal car accident.
Yes.
Taking a look at the file, and I just kept bumping up on the same question:
Why didn't you give a blood test to Detective Reed?
I'm sorry.
The DA has a strict policy on commenting on police matters.
If you contact our Integrity Bureau,
I'm sure they can schedule an appointment.
Hang on.
I'll tell you what.
Look, I don't like red tape, so why don't we just cut through it?
Detective Reed has his disciplinary hearing tomorrow.
This is a subpoena.
You don't want to answer me here, you can show up there and do it under oath.
Amy?
I'm Annabeth Chase.
I'm a prosecutor.
You're the one who found me.
I had a lot of help with that.
Amy, I know you're tired, but I need you to tell me what you remember.
I went to the party.
I got dizzy, so I went outside.
Is that where you met Derrick?
He gave me some water.
Told me he'd drive me home.
I just felt really sick.
Amy, look at me.
Is Derrick the man who kidnapped you?
Please tell me what happened.
I can't.
We... we were walking to the car and... things started to spin.
I must have blacked out.
I don't remember where he took me.
It was dark and, um...
I could feel somebody's breath on me.
I...
I knew somebody was touching me.
Did you see his face?
Do you remember his voice?
No.
I was trying to think.
I was trying to concentrate, but I couldn't.
Okay.
It's okay.
I can't put her on the stand.
She's all we have;
we banked everything on this.
He drugged her.
We have nothing.
When's the hearing?
It starts tomorrow.
Fine.
It doesn't sound fine.
It sounds like you're disappointed.
I said I would support your decision.
You call this support?
You're upset.
I'm not upset.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not!
I'm not your father.
I'm not disappointed in you.
I'm concerned... as a prosecutor, as an executive who doesn't want to see his staff in a political war with the police.
Since when do politics override justice?
Justice for who?
Your victim's family?
What about the victims in those murder cases?
Not if we lose the next election.
Can't do much justice when you're out of a job.
Are you ordering me not to testify?
No, I'm not ordering you to do anything.
I'm asking you to see yourself.
You launch yourself into things.
You're never afraid of anything.
The problem is, Maureen, sometimes, there are things to be afraid of.
In this job, doing the right thing can be excruciating.
It can force you to destroy a friend, put your career on the line.
It's hard.
And the fact that you find it so easy...
I never said it was easy.
Hey, why don't you take a break?
I can't.
Come on.
You've been at it for hours.
Derrick Adler's arraignment is coming up.
I need evidence that's not tainted by the confession.
Baby, you saved that girl's life, okay?
If it wasn't for you, they'd still be out there searching.
It's not enough.
What if someone took Haley?
It wouldn't be enough to get her back.
I couldn't sleep every night knowing he was out there, knowing he could do it again.
You can't do this with every case, all right?
You're pushing yourself too hard.
I'm fine.
Jack, I'm fine.
Everyone, okay, listen up.
I know you've all been working hard.
My thanks to everyone who jumped in to help.
Here's where we are.
Any evidence found in the storage locker is out.
We also learned yesterday that the victim's testimony won't meet our burden.
I know this seems impossible, but I think we can still make a case.
At the precinct,
I asked you to find independent evidence.
Anything that didn't stem from the confession is still fair game.
The good news is we got a jump on this early.
These are the roads Derrick Adler could have taken the night of the crime.
The ones in red have already been covered.
I want every possible stop checked:
gas stations, restaurants...
We're trying, but you're talking about 40 square miles.
I know.
This is our only shot.
We need a witness, a lead.
Someone who saw them driving together.
There's something we don't know yet, and we need to find it.
How much time do we have?
I'll be in court in 24 hours.
?
?
Anything not related to the confession.
We're trying.
We just need more time.
We don't have more time.
By law, prosecutors must arraign
Derrick Adler today, but sources say the police are still searching for enough evidence to hold him.
This case is marked for arraignment?
Yes, Your Honor, but as you can see, the People have yet to produce my client.
Mr. Adler is being processed, Your Honor.
Processed?
He's not a wheel of cheese, Ms. Chase.
Is he in the building or not?
Not yet.
Fine.
We'll second call his case in 45 minutes.
Next.
How much longer?
Just a few minutes.
Your testimony's next.
Don't pay any attention to them.
I didn't expect to see you here.
I said I'd back you up, Maureen.
I meant it.
Maureen?
Can you give me a minute?
You really going in there?
They subpoenaed me.
Look...
I was wrong.
It's too late, Billy.
Please.
You know me.
Not married, no kids.
I'm a cop.
Job's the only thing I have.
I got a lot of good left in me.
I got a lot of cases left to make.
Okay, I let this one slide, but I'll make it up.
What do you want me to do?
I can't lie under oath.
Maybe you could say you don't remember.
That's perjury, Billy.
It's corruption.
Do you realize what you're asking me?
Give me another chance, Maureen.
I'm a good detective.
Don't take that away from me.
Maureen Scofield.
We're ready.
When was this?
About five days ago.
Can't say he looks familiar.
Well, look again.
He would have come in late.
11:00, maybe 12:00.
He might have had a girl with him.
Oh, wait.
I do know this guy.
What's this about?
His girlfriend?
He had a girlfriend with him?
Hey, uh, look, man, whatever she was on, she didn't get it here.
Just tell me what happened.
He came in to pay.
Uh, full tank on pump one out front.
He goes to give me the cash, and suddenly,
I see his girlfriend getting out of the car.
Man, she was out of her mind.
She starts walking out in the middle of traffic...
And you just stood there?
No, I told the guy.
When he saw her, he went white as a ghost.
Said she had a few too many;
he was taking her home.
She okay?
You got cameras out front?
Yeah, but they don't show much.
I need that tape.
Now.
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Ms. Scofield, I'd like to, uh, if I may, dispense with the usual pleasantries and get right to the point.
Fine.
As the, uh, prosecuting attorney in this matter, why did you not seek a blood test to determine if Mr. Reed was legally intoxicated?
I did.
Sorry, could you say that again?
I did.
I ordered Detective William Margate to get the test.
He ignored my order.
I see.
And, uh... did Detective Margate tell you why he ignored your order?
That test was critical to the prosecution's ability to make a case here.
If he intentionally failed to get it, that would be obstruction of justice and would be of great interest to this panel.
This needs to work.
I can't stall much longer.
I'm coming up on it now.
There he is.
That's the car.
Is this the only camera angle?
We need to see inside.
It's all they had.
Okay, he's going in to pay.
Amy must be getting out now.
Oh, we can't see anything.
We can't even prove she was in the car.
Wait a second, what was that?
What?
Did you see that?
Run it back.
Freeze it.
That-- what is that?
I don't know.
Looks like a water bottle.
ANNABETH:
Must be the one he gave Amy.
The one he used to knock her out.
We didn't find it at the storage locker.
That's it.
That has to be it.
I'm going back to the gas station.
Detective William Margate.
Here.
Step in, please.
The panel has a few questions for you.
You sure it's in here?
Has to be.
Trucks don't pick up till the weekend.
REYNOLDS:
This is ridiculous.
My client still isn't here.
I haven't even spoken to him yet.
It's not ridiculous.
We technically have a few more hours to arraign Mr. Adler.
All right, Ms. Chase.
Enough is enough.
I want the defendant here.
Your Honor, may I be heard?
No, you may not.
Mr. Reynolds, confer with your client when he arrives.
As for you, Ms. Chase, you've wasted this court's time all day.
I will give you until exactly 5:00.
That's three hours from now.
We've got 12 bottles.
I'm taking them to the lab right now.
Let me know as soon as you hear.
You really think one of these is the answer?
I'd say our chances are one in 12.
I'm sorry.
The blood test was never done.
By waiting too long, Detective Margate destroyed any evidence of intoxication.
So the driver, he just walks away?
No.
I've started a larger investigation.
There may be a witness to the accident, someone who saw him drunk at the bar.
I won't give up.
What about Detective Margate?
He testified at the hearing.
The panel didn't believe his statement and he will be forced to resign from the department.
In the meantime, this office is filing criminal charges.
Thank you.
For my husband.
You a baseball fan?
What?
You like baseball?
Uh, yes.
Well, in baseball terms, I'd say we just turned a triple play.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It's after 5:00.
We have rules, Ms. Chase.
But from what I hear, you're not interested in rules.
If I could just explain.
Don't bother.
Mr. Reynolds has been filling me in.
He claims you deliberately violated his client's right to counsel-- is that true?
Yes.
Yes?
Then you realize the defendant's confession is out.
I do.
And all the other evidence obtained as a result.
I read the file and while I may personally wish I could rule different, the law is very clear.
I'm holding everything found at the storage unit inadmissible.
I understand.
Then help me understand.
From what I see, you have almost no other evidence.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't release Mr. Adler and dismiss these charges.
I have that reason right here.
This is the bottle the defendant used to drug Amy Flynn.
Objection, that evidence is fruit of the poisonous tree.
It was derived from the confession.
No, it wasn't.
The defendant never said anything about a bottle.
He never said he drugged the victim.
We learned about this from Amy herself.
Yes, and you found Amy because of the confession.
Hold on, Mr. Reynolds.
The physical evidence is out, but the victim's independent opportunity to observe is still in play.
The defendant's palm print is on this bottle.
Inside, we found traces of Rohypnol, the drug found in Amy's bloodstream.
We also found her salvia on the lip.
JUDGE:
Let me be clear.
The defendant never mentioned this.
Never.
We were very careful, Your Honor.
This was a separate investigation.
Your Honor, I...
Save it, Mr. Reynolds.
She's got you.
I'd like to hear your client explain that bottle to a jury.
The defendant is held without bail.
Mr. Adler, I am remanding you to the custody of the correctional system.
It won't be pleasant.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Listen, about the other day...
Steve, it's okay.
You were right;
I shouldn't have made the decision without you.
True.
But I've been thinking about why I reacted the way that I did.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
I was thrown.
Not because of what you did, but maybe because it never even occurred to me.
I've been doing this for so long, the only thing I see is the case.
I've taught myself to see the process, not the people involved in it.
The truth is, when Derrick Adler asked for a lawyer,
I'd have stopped.
And a girl would be dead.
Don't ever lose that, Annabeth.
Don't ever stop seeing the people.
Amy Flynn is back home tonight, with he family.
Meanwhile, Derrick Adler faces life in prison.
I think about those parents who never found their child, never got to bring them home.
Oh, if I ever lost you I would search to the ends of the earth.
Hey... nobody's losing anybody.

- Number 17, please.
- That'll be fine, thank you.
Goodbye.
Thank you so much.
Hello, Fawlty Towers.
Oh, hello, Mr. Hawkins.
- I've arranged your car for 2:00.
- Thank you.
Well, you did say today, Mr. Hawkins.
- You do accept checks?
- With a banker's card, yes.
Well, we have to cancel the order then.
Yes.
No, no, 5:00 will be fine.
Goodbye.
Polly, Brenda can't start till Monday.
Would you mind doing the rooms until then?
- Oh, no.
I could do with the money.
- Oh, good.
There you are.
Thank you, Mr. Yardley.
Oh, hello.
Can I help you?
- Yes...
- Girl, would you give me change for this, please?
In one moment.
I'm just dealing with this gentleman.
- Yes, Mr. Thurston...
- What?
- I was wondering...
- I need change for this!
In a moment.
I'm dealing with this gentleman.
But I have a taxi driver waiting.
Surely this gentleman wouldn't mind if you just gave me change.
- Do you?
- No, no.
Go ahead.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Can you tell me how to get to Glendower Street?
Now, I've booked a room and bath with a sea view for three nights.
- Glendower Street?
- Yes.
You haven't finished with me.
Missus...?
Mrs. Richards.
Mrs. Alice Richards.
Mrs. Richards, Mr. Thurston.
Mr. Thurston, Mrs. Richards.
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending to at the moment.
What?
Mr. Thurston is the gentleman I'm attending...
Don't shout.
I'm not deaf.
Mr. Thurston was here before you, Mrs. Richards.
But you were serving me!
I gave you change, but I hadn't finished dealing with him.
Now, Glendower Street...
Isn't there anyone else in attendance?
Really, this is the most appalling service!
What a good idea!
Manuel, could you lend Mrs. Richards your assistance in connection with her reservation?
Now...
I've reserved a very quiet room with a bath and a sea view.
I specifically asked for a sea view in my written confirmation, so please make sure I have it.
Qué?
- What?
- Qué?
- K?
- Sí.
C?
"KC"?
"KC"?
What are you trying to say?
No, no, no, no.
- Qué:
What.
- K-watt?
Sí.
Qué... what.
- C.K. Watt?
- Yes!
Who is C.K. Watt?
Qué?
Is he the manager, Mr. Watt?
- Manaher!
- He is?
Ah, Mr. Fawlty!
- What?
- Fawlty!
What are you talking about, you silly little man?
What is going on here?
I ask him for my room, and he tells me the manager's a Mr. Watt, aged 40.
No.
No, no.
Faw-lty.
"Faulty"?
What's wrong with him?
It's all right, Mrs. Richards.
He's from Barcelona.
The manager's from Barcelona?
No, no, no.
He's from Swanage.
- And you're in 22.
- What?
You're in room 22.
Manuel, take these cases up to 22, will you?
Very nice stay, Mr. Fawlty.
Ah, glad you enjoyed it.
Polly, would you get Mr. Firkin's bill, please?
When will we see you again?
Oh, not for a few weeks.
You're not by any chance a betting man, Mr. Fawlty?
Er... well, I used to be.
Only there's a very nice little filly running at Exeter this afternoon.
- Really?
- Dragonfly.
Ah.
- Dragonfly?
- Yeah.
It's well worth a flutter, but pay the tax on it before...
Oh, delighted you enjoyed your stay.
Very nice.
Hope to see you again before long.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, Mrs. Fawlty.
Goodbye, Mr. Firkin.
A satisfied customer.
We should have him stuffed.
Oh, Mr. Fawlty, 3:00, Exeter, Dragonfly.
Right?
Yes, good luck!
Jolly... jolly good luck with it.
Morning, Major.
Good morning, Fawlty.
Yes, dear?
What was that about the 3:00 at Exeter, Basil?
Oh, some horse he's gonna bet on, I expect.
You're looking very spruce this morning, Major.
- St. George's Day, old boy.
- Really?
Got a horse, have you?
What's his name?
Did you catch it, dear?
Dragonfly, Major.
- Going to have a flutter, Fawlty?
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, Basil doesn't bet anymore, Major.
Do you, dear?
No, I don't, dear, no.
That particular avenue of pleasure has been closed off for me.
And we don't want it opened up again, do we, Basil?
No, you don't, dear.
No.
The great warning-off of May 8th, yes.
Good old Saint George, eh, Major?
Well, he killed a hideous fire-breathing old dragon, didn't he?
Ran it through with a lance, I believe.
Mr. Fawlty!
Mr. Fawlty!
Is Missus...
room no like.
She want speak to you.
Is problem.
Ever see my wife making toast, Polly?
Why... why'd he kill it anyway, Fawlty?
I don't know, Major.
Better than marrying it.
Marrying it?
But he didn't have to kill it, though, did he?
I mean, he could've, uh, just not turned up at the church.
Good morning, Madam.
Can I help you?
- Are you the manager?
- I am the owner, Madam.
- What?
- I am the owner.
I want to speak to the manager.
- I am the manager, too.
- What?
I am the manager as well.
Manaher.
He manaher.
Oh, you're Watt.
I'm the manager!
- What?
- I'm the manager!
Yes, I know.
You've just told me.
What's the matter with you?
Now, listen to me.
I booked a room with a bath.
When I book a room with a bath, I expect to get a bath.
You've got a bath.
I'm not paying £7.20p per night, plus V.A.T., for a room without a bath!
Here is your bath.
You call that a bath?
It's not big enough to drown a mouse.
It's disgraceful!
I wish you were a mouse.
I'd show you.
And another thing.
I asked for a room with a view.
Deaf, mad, and blind.
This is the view as far as I can remember, madam.
Yes, yes, this is it.
When I pay for a view,
I expect something more interesting than that.
That is Torquay, madam.
That is not good enough.
Well, may I ask what you were expecting to see out of a Torquay hotel bedroom window?
Sydney Opera House, perhaps?
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon?
Herds of wildebeest sweeping majestically...
Don't be silly.
I expect to be able to see the sea.
You can see the sea.
It's over there between the land and the sky.
I need a telescope to see that.
Well, may I suggest that you consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea?
Or preferably in it?
Right.
Now, listen to me.
I'm not satisfied, but I've decided to stay here.
However, I shall expect a reduction.
Why, because Krakatoa's not erupting at the moment?
Because the room is cold, the bath is too small, the view is invisible, and the radio doesn't work.
No, the radio works.
You don't.
What?
I'll see if I can fix it, you scabby old bat.
- I think we got something then.
- What?
I think we got something then!
What are you doing?
Qué?
Madam, don't think me rude, but may I ask, do you by any chance have a hearing aid?
A what?
A hearing aid!
Yes, I do have a hearing aid.
Would you like me to get it mended?
!
Mended?
It's working perfectly all right.
No, it isn't!
I haven't got it turned on at the moment.
- Why not?
- The battery runs down.
Now, what sort of a reduction are you going to give me on this room?
- 60% if you turn it on.
- What?
My wife handles all such matters.
I'm sure she will be delighted to discuss it with you.
I shall speak to her after lunch.
You heard that all right, didn't you?
- What?
- Thank you so much.
Lunch will be served at half past 12:00.
Manuel!
Manuel!
Are you going to the betting shop today?
- What?
- Oh, don't you start!
You go betting shop today?
Oh, sí!
Betting shop, sí!
Now, I want you to put this on this little horse,
Dragonfly, but... big secret.
Sybil no know.
No, no, it's lovely.
It's just a bit buttery with my skin.
I think I need something more... more... topazy, for my coloring, you know, more tonal.
Have you got...
have you got Cosmopolitan there?
Page 42, you see Burt Reynolds?
Well, there's a girl standing behind him looking at James Caan.
That sort of color.
Mm.
Lovely.
All right, I'll be in at 11:00.
- Oh, Polly...
- Hmm?
I've got to check the laundry.
Could you keep an eye on reception for me?
Sure.
Polly, Polly, where Mr. Fawlty?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
I have money for him.
He win on horse, but big secret, sh!
Mrs. Fawlty, sh!
Well, give it to me.
I'll give it to him.
Good afternoon, Miss Gatsby.
Good afternoon, Miss Tibbs.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
First they give me a room without a bath, then there's no lavatory paper!
Would you like some of ours?
We keep an extra supply.
Yes.
Would you like some of ours?
Hello!
Girl, there's no paper in my room.
Why don't you check these things?
That's what you're being paid for, isn't it?
- We don't put it in the rooms.
- What?
We keep it in the lounge.
In the lounge?
!
I'll get you some.
Do you want plain ones, or ones with our address on it?
Address on it?
!
How many sheets?
Well, how many are you going to use?
Manager!
Just enough for one?
Tell me.
Manager!
Manager!
Yes?
Testing...
testing...
There you are.
I've never met such insolence in my life!
I come down here to get some lavatory paper, and she starts asking me the most insulting, personal things I've ever heard in my life!
I thought she wanted writing paper.
- I'm talking to you, Watt!
- Watt?
Are you deaf?
I said I'm talking to you.
I've never met such insolence in my life.
She said people use it in the lounge.
- Yes, she thought...
- Then she starts asking me...
- No, please listen...
- Appalling questions about...
I can explain.
No, you see, she thought you wanted to write.
Wanted a fight?
I'll give her a fight, all right!
- No, no, no.
Wanted to write!
- What?
Wanted to write.
On the paper.
Why should I want to write on it?
I'll have some sent up to your room immediately.
Manuel!
That doesn't work either.
What were you saying just now?
- Turn it on.
- What?
Turn it...
Turn... it... on.
I can't read that.
I need my glasses.
Where are they?
They're on your head, Mrs. Richards.
I've lost them.
They're the only pair I've got.
I can't read a thing without them.
Excuse me!
- Now, I had them this morning...
- Mrs. Richards...
When I was buying the vase...
I put them on to look at it, and then I had them at tea time...
Mrs. Richards!
Your glasses are there!
There?
Who put them in there?
No, no, no!
On your head!
- What?
- On your...
look,
On...
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Fawlty.
Manuel asked me to give this to you.
Oh!
Thank you, Polly, and, Polly...
Not a word to the dragon, eh?
- No.
- Right.
Oh, Manuel, get some loo paper, muchos, for 22.
Uh, twent... sí.
Are you blind?
There were on my head all the time.
Didn't you see?
- Yes.
- Didn't God give you eyes?
Yes, but I don't use 'em, 'cause it wears the batteries out.
Send my paper up immediately.
What's all that?
22.
Evening, Terry.
Do you like Cavaliera Rusticana, Terry?
I've never had it, Mr. Fawlty.
You're in a good mood, Mr. Fawlty.
Had a little bit of luck on the gee-gees.
Not a word to the "trouble and strife", eh?
Oh, de Camptown Ladies sing this song
Doo dah, doo dah
Camptown racetrack five miles long
Doo-dah doo-dah day
Goin' to run all night
Goin' to run all day
Gonna bet me money on the bobtail nag...
I did it my way.
Can't stand Frank Sinatra.
"You make me feel so young".
Rubbish.
You seem very jolly, Basil.
Hmm?
You seem very jolly.
Jolly?
Yes, jolly.
Sort of... happy.
Oh, happy.
Yes, I remember that.
Not that I noticed, dear, no.
I'll report it if it happens, though.
Well, you look happy to me, Basil.
No, I'm not, dear.
All that dancing about, singing and rubbing your hands.
Just my way of getting through the day, dear.
The Samaritans were engaged.
I thought maybe you were in love.
Hah!
Only with you, light of my life.
Or had a bit of luck or something.
Did Mr. Hawkins deliver the tonics, Terry?
Yes, he did, Mrs. Fawlty.
Manuel!
Manuel!
Oh, your horse, it win!
It win!
Shh!
Shh!
Manuel...
You know nothing.
You always say, Mr. Fawlty, but I learn.
- What?
- I learn, I learn.
- No, no...
- I get better!
No, you don't understand.
- I do!
- No, you don't.
I...
I do understand that...
Shh!
Shh!
You know nothing about the horse.
I know nothing about the horse.
Yes.
Ah.
Which horse?
What?
Which horse I know nothing?
My horse, nitwit!
Your horse, Nitwit?
No, no, Dragonfly!
- It won!
- Yes, I know!
I know it won, too!
I put money on for you.
You give me money, I go to betting shop...
Yes, I know, I know!
Why you say I know nothing?
Look, look, look...
You know the horse?
Uh...
Nitwit or Dragonfly?
Dragonfly!
There isn't a horse called...
you're the nitwit!
What is "wit-nit"?
It doesn't matt...
I could spend the rest of my life having this conversation!
Please, please try to understand before one of us dies!
I try.
You're going to forget everything you know about Nitwit.
No, no, Dragonfly.
Dragonfly!
Yes!
Sí, sí, sí.
Eventually.
What?
Eventually.
Uh, at the end.
No, no, no, forget it now!
Now?
Well, pretend you forget!
Pretend?
Well, don't say anything to anyone about the horse!
I know that.
You tell me that this morning!
- Basil...?
- So don't do it again!
Yes, dear?
It's Mrs. Richards.
A fatal accident?
She's had some money stolen.
Oh, Mr. Fawlty,
I tell Polly.
That's all right, but don't tell anyone else, not even me!
You know nothing!
- Basil?
- Yes, dear?
You've got to help me handle this.
She's in a frightful state.
I can't get a word in edgewise.
She's had £85 taken from her room.
I said we'll search everyone, but she insists we send for the police.
What do we do with someone like that?
She just keeps on!
Mrs. Richards, how very nice to see you!
Are you enjoying your stay?
There's no need to shout.
I have my hearing aid on.
Mrs. Richards, I've explained to my husband...
I've just been up to my room.
£85 has been taken from my bag, which I had hidden under the mattress.
Oh, yes?
It's a disgrace!
I haven't been here a day.
- What sort of staff do you employ?
- Mrs. Richards...
If you knew anything at all about running a hotel, this sort of thing wouldn't happen!
Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
What?
Wait, wait, wait.
I haven't got it turned up enough.
Basil!
I said I suggest...
Oh, my head, my head!
Has it come away?
Did you bang your head?
Yes!
Yes!
Oh, dear.
Let me have a look.
You'd better go and lie down before something else happens.
Shut up!
Why don't you call the police?
We will, the moment we've searched the rooms.
My money's been taken!
Yes, yes, I know.
Try not to speak.
Is this a piece of your brain?
£85.
Take my arm.
I don't need your arm, thank you.
I can get down the stairs perfectly well by myself.
"Down" the stairs?
Don't stop when you get to the basement.
Keep straight on.
Give my regards to the earth's core.
Are you sure you can manage?
And if you give us any more trouble, I shall visit you in the small hours and put a bat up your nightdress.
Well, that was fun, wasn't it?
The odd moment like that, almost worth staying alive for, isn't it?
It's nice to share a moment like that, isn't it?
It's what marriage is all about.
I know.
I read it on the back of a matchbox.
Basil, sometimes...
Seriously, Sybil, do you remember when we were first... manacled together?
We used to laugh quite a lot.
Yes, but not at the same time, Basil.
That's true.
That was a warning, I guess.
Should have spotted that, shouldn't I?
Zoom! "What was that?" "That was your life, mate."
"Oh.
That was quick.
Do I get another?"
"Sorry, mate, that's your lot."
Basil.
Back to the world of dreams.
Yes, dear?
What are we going to do?
Give it another 15 years?
- About the money.
Do you...
- Aw, she's left it in her room, or eaten it or something.
We'll get Manuel to go through the room.
Polly can check the lounge...
- I saw Polly with money just now.
- Well, there you are.
Quite a bit, too.
She was counting it in here.
Well, it's probably hers.
No, she's been very short lately.
I'll ask her...
Well, you can't.
You can't just ask her like that.
- Why not?
- It would be terribly rude, asking someone if money is theirs.
That would be so embarrassing!
Rubbish, Basil.
Hello, Fawlty Towers.
Polly Sherman?
Yes, certainly, I'll get her straightway.
Hang on.
Polly!
Terry, where's Polly?
In there.
- She saw you with the money!
- What?
She saw you counting the horse money!
She's just coming...
oh, hello, dear.
Here she is.
Found her in here.
As I was just saying, Polly, my wife would like a word with you about a slightly delicate matter.
It's not delicate, Basil.
Don't be silly.
He thinks it's embarrassing for me to ask you about that money I saw you with earlier on in the office.
I wondered if someone had handed it in.
Mrs. Richards has lost some.
The money?
In the office?
You were counting it, weren't you?
Did someone hand it in?
Oh, no.
No, it's mine.
Yours?
I won it.
You won it?
On the horse Mr. Fawlty got a tip on.
I hope you don't mind, I...
No, no, not at all.
I didn't know you bet on the horses, Polly.
Oh, I don't.
Only I was in the town, and I passed the betting shop, and I thought, well, why not?
Well, why not indeed?
Jolly good question, eh, dear?
Pity you didn't let me put something on, really.
You realize how much we would've won?
£75 for a £5 stake.
Still, you know best.
Those were the odds, were they, Basil?
Yes, that's right, dear.
14-1.
I listened in on the wireless just to make sure it had triumphed.
Enjoy your winnings, Polly.
Thank you.
Polly.
Yes, Mrs. Fawlty?
What was the name of the horse?
The name?
Uh...
I've gone blank.
Birdbrain!
Birdbrain?
No, no, that came in third.
Uh...
Fishwife!
- What?
- No...
No, not that.
Small...
Fly!
Fly!
Flying Tart!
No, no, no, it got off to a flying start, and it's name... was Dragonfly!
Thank you, Polly.
If I find out the money on that horse was yours, you know what I'll do, Basil.
You'll have to sew 'em back on first.
- Ah, Major!
- 6:00, old boy.
Oh, so it is.
Uh, Major...
Can I offer you, uh...
Oh, very decent of you.
Just a quick one.
Going to a memorial service.
Ah.
Tie's a bit bright, isn't it, Major?
- What?
- For a memorial service?
Oh, I didn't like the chap.
One of those.
Know what I mean?
- Cheers.
- Uh, Major... could you do me a favor?
Well, I'm a bit short myself, old boy.
No, no, could you look after some money for me?
I won it on that horse.
Only Sybil's a bit suspicious, you see?
She goes through my pockets some nights.
Oh, absolutely.
Which horse?
- Uh, Dragonfly.
- When's it running?
No, it ran today.
I won that on it.
Oh.
Well done, old boy.
No, could you keep it?
No, I couldn't do that, very decent of you...
No, could you keep it just tonight?
It's Sybil, you see?
Secret.
Ah, a present.
Sort of, yes.
Don't mention it.
Mum's the word.
I'll get it from you in the morning and bank it.
Understood, old boy.
Cheers.
There you are, Mr. Mackintosh.
There you are, Mr. Mackintosh.
Good morning, Mr. Fawlty.
Good morning, ladies.
Hello.
Fawlty Towers.
Watt!
I didn't say anything.
Have you called the police yet?
Excuse me, I'm trying to take a telephone call.
Have you called them yet?
Yes, yes, we have.
When are they going to be here then?
As soon as possible.
They're very busy today.
Busy.
Humph!
Lot of bloodshed at the Nell Gwyn Tea Rooms last night.
Hello?
Certainly, yes.
Mrs. Richards?
Mrs. Richards!
Sorry.
Telephone for you.
- Here.
- Yes?
What's this for?
- Uh, telephone calls?
- But I haven't made any.
- Uh...
Cigarettes?
- I don't smoke.
There's nobody there.
Hello?
Yes, yes, I know she is.
Yes.
It's your sister!
Well, what is it for?
Umm...
Drinks?
Drinks?
Me?
We've been cut off.
Hello?
Look, you tell me, and I'll tell her.
Even the phones don't work.
Your sister says you've had an offer of £87,000 for your house in Brighton.
87,000?
Give it to me.
Don't be a fool, Stephanie.
92,750 I said, and I'm not taking a penny less.
You tell him that.
Why don't people listen?
Well?
Well, let's scrub that 32p then, shall we?
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh, Major!
Major!
Um, can I have it now?
- What, old boy?
- The money.
The money I gave you last night?
What... what is all this about?
You remember I gave you some money just before you went to that remembrance service?
- Remembrance service?
- Yes.
I don't remember that, old boy.
It was for a chap you didn't like.
You know, he was...
one of those...?
One of those what?
Well...
Pansy?
Yes.
Which one?
No, no, no, no.
You were in your best suit.
Was I?
Oh, yes, of course!
I went to the theater, of course!
- No, no...
- Yes, yes, with Winnie Atwell, yes.
Winnie Atwell?
Well, Marjorie Atwell then, Marjorie.
I always call her Winnie because...
well, because she looks like Winnie.
She's not black.
Black?
Churchill wasn't black.
Look, look, look,
I gave you £75.
You put it in there.
What do you mean by telling me you called the police?
You've done no such thing.
Your wife's just told me you're still searching the rooms.
Well, I thought she'd called them.
You lying hound!
- Mrs. Richards...
- Go and call them now, immediately.
Mrs. Richards, we will, the moment we've searched...
Right.
I shall call them myself then.
Couldn't we just wait until...
I've never seen such a place!
All right, Mrs. Richards.
Would you like to use the office phone?
What?
In here.
Thank you.
Basil!
Get the key and check her room.
Right.
I found it, Fawlty!
It was in my pocket!
Yes, in my new suit!
- Major, sh!
- In here, you see?
- Stuffed right down.
- Can I have it?
I don't know how it got there, you, see, because I make a point of keeping my money in my hip pocket.
Yes, please!
Please!
- What, old boy?
- Can I have it?
Oh, yes, yes, the money.
Yes, yes, of course.
Good God, it's gone!
No, no, in there!
Basil?
- Here it is!
- What's that?
I found it, Mrs. Fawlty.
The money.
Oh, that's marvelous!
Mrs. Richards!
What?
We found your money.
No!
The Major's found your money.
- No!
N-nn...
- What?
Thank you so much, Major.
There you are.
I told you it would turn up.
What is it, Basil?
Bit of luck, eh, Fawlty?
It's £10 short.
Oh, dear.
It's not!
£10 short?
Oh, my God!
Don't worry, we'll have a whip round!
Basil, stop!
What's he doing now?
What on earth do you think you're doing?
I'll look for the missing £10 immediately, Mrs. Richards.
Where exactly did you find it, Major?
In my pocket.
In your pocket?
Yeah, yeah.
Not this suit.
In my new suit.
Would you mind if I popped up and had a look?
No, no, not at all.
I'll see if I can find it.
Won't be a moment.
Uh, it's in with the, um, the, uh...
Did you say it was in your pocket?
Yes, yes.
What was it doing in your pocket?
Can I explain?
You're not explaining anything.
You're completely loopy.
Mad as a March hare!
Yes, yes, I am.
Yes, I am completely loopy.
That's why I gave him the money to look after.
You see, there's been a mistake.
That money there is in fact mine.
- Yours?
- Yes, as the Major will confirm, you see, I was saving it up for a present for my wife.
That's why I couldn't say anything just now, but I gave it to the Major last night...
What rubbish!
This is my money.
No, the Major will verify what I've said.
Hmm?
- Could you verify that, Major?
- What, old boy?
Uhh...
The money.
I gave you last night, for my wife's present?
I gave it to you just before you went to the theater?
The theater?
Well...
Yes.
You... you remember?
That money I won on the horses!
A horse?
Why are you whispering?
What are you saying?
He says he won it on a horse.
Won it on a horse?
Shh!
It doesn't matter!
Do you remember me giving it to you?
Oh, think!
Please think!
What was the question again?
Oh, the money, the money!
Do you...
Manuel!
Manuel!
Manuel!
Manuel!
You remember I had some money yesterday?
The money I won on the horse?
Oh, sí.
Tell Mrs. Richards.
Tell her I had the money yesterday.
Ahem-hem!
I know nothing.
What?
I know nothing.
- No, no...
- Nothing.
No, no, forget that!
I forget everything.
I know nothing.
- You can tell her!
- No, I cannot.
Yes, yes, tell her!
Tell her.
Please!
Please!
Tell her.
Tell her!
Tell her!
Tell her, or I'll kill you!
Oh.
Ha ha!
No, I know nothing.
I am from Barcelona.
I'm not listening to any more of this rubbish!
I'm going to finish my breakfast, and when I come back, I want the rest of my money.
Give it to her, Basil.
I can't find it.
Give her 10 from the till.
Right!
What are you doing?
I'm going to give her the shirt off my back, too!
You see?
I know nothing.
I'm gonna send you to a vivisectionist.
Now...
Good afternoon, Mr. Fawlty.
Good afternoon.
You got a Mrs. Richards staying here?
Yes.
Oh.
Ah, well, only she bought this yesterday, asked us to deliver it.
The thing is, she left some money behind.
Keeps it in this.
95 quid.
Look.
The cleaner found it this morning.
Almost threw it in the bin.
Lucky, eh?
Is she around?
Nope.
I'll give it to her.
Oh.
Thanks, Mr. Fawlty.
Goodbye.
Mm-mwah!
We found her money!
Where?
She... it doesn't matter.
I'm £10 up on the deal!
£10 up?
Yes, it's 95...
even if I give her 10,
I'm still 10 up!
Polly, for the first time in my life, I'm ahead!
I'm winning!
Hello, Mrs. Richards.
How lovely to see you.
Your beautiful vase that you bought yesterday has just arrived.
Now, remind me, the money that you have there, is it yours or mine?
I told you.
It's mine.
You're absolutely sure?
Yes, I am.
- But you're still £10 short?
- Yes.
Polly, give Mrs. Richards this, would you?
What's that?
This is mine.
What's that, Basil?
It's mine.
What?
It's the money I won on the horse.
Oh, yes, right.
Polly asked me to put it in the safe for her.
So, that's all sorted out, and this is your money, Polly.
And this is your beautiful vase, Mrs. Richards.
Fawlty!
You did give me that money!
You won it on that horse!
Aah!
That cost £75!
Oh, I am sorry, Mrs. Richards.
We must pay you back.
There you are.
One...
ney in my hip pocket.
Yes, please!
Please!
- What, old boy?
- Can I have it?
Oh, yes, yes, the money.
Yes, yes, of course.
Good God, it's gone!
No, no, in there!
Basil?
- Here it is!
- What's that?
I found it, Mrs. Fawlty.
The money.
Oh, that's marvelous!
Mrs. Richards!
What?
We found your money.
No!
The Major's found your money.
- No!
N-nn...
- What?
Thank you so much, Major.
There you are.
I told you it would turn up.
What is it, Basil?
Bit of luck, eh, Fawlty?
It's £10 short.
Oh, dear.
It's not!
£10 short?
Oh, my God!
Don't worry, we'll have a whip round!
Basil, stop!
What's he doing now?
What on earth do you think you're doing?
I'll look for the missing £10 immediately, Mrs. Richards.
Where exactly did you find it, Major?
In my pocket.
In your pocket?
Yeah, yeah.
Not this suit.
In my new suit.
Would you mind if I popped up and had a look?
No, no, not at all.
I'll see if I can find it.
Won't be a moment.
Uh, it's in with the, um, the, uh...
Did you say it was in your pocket?
Yes, yes.
What was it doing in your pocket?
Can I explain?
You're not explaining anything.
You're completely loopy.
Mad as a March hare!
Yes, yes, I am.
Yes, I am completely loopy.
That's why I gave him the money to look after.
You see, there's been a mistake.
That money there is in fact mine.
- Yours?
- Yes, as the Major will confirm, you see, I was saving it up for a present for my wife.
That's why I couldn't say anything just now, but I gave it to the Major last night...
What rubbish!
This is my money.
No, the Major will verify what I've said.
Hmm?
- Could you verify that, Major?
- What, old boy?
Uhh...
The money.
I gave you last night, for my wife's present?
I gave it to you
One double room without bath for the 16th, 17th and 18th... yes, and if you'd be so good as to confirm by letter?
Thank you so much, goodbye.
Have you made up the bill for room twelve, Basil?
No, I haven't yet, no.
Well, they're in a hurry.
Polly says they didn't get their alarm call.
And Basil, please get that picture up, it's been there for a week.
It's been there since Monday, Sybil...
Tuesday...
Wednesday...
Thursday...
Good morning.
Friday...
Sat--
Manuel!
There is too much butter on those trays.
Que?
There is too much butter on those trays.
- No, no, no, Senor!
- What?
Not 'on- those- trays'.
No sir - 'uno dos tres.'
- Uno, dos, tres.
- No, no.
Hay mucho burro alli!
Que?
Hay mucho burro alli!
Ah, mantequilla!
What?
Que?
Mantequilla.
Burro is-is hee-haw.
What?
Burro-Burro is hee-haw, hee-haw.
Manuel, por favor.
Uno momento.
Si, si, si.
What's the matter, Basil?
Nothing, dear, I'm just dealing with it.
He speak good...
how do you say...?
English!
Mantequilla, solamente, dos.
Dos?
Don't look at me.
You're the one who's supposed to be able to speak it.
Two pieces!
Two each!
Arriba, arriba!
I don't know why you wanted to hire him, Basil.
Because he's cheap and keen to learn, dear.
And in this day and age such...
But why did you say you could speak the language?
I learnt classical Spanish, not the strange dialect he seems to have picked up.
It'd be quicker to train a monkey.
Good morning Miss Gatsby, morning Miss Tibbs.
Good morning, good morning.
- Basil!
- Yes, dear?
Are you going to hang the picture?
- Yes, dear, yes, yes...
- When?
When I've, when I've...
Well, why don't you do it now?
Well, I'm doing this, dear I'm doing the menu.
You've got all morning to do the menu.
Why don't you hang the picture now?
- Well?
- Yes, all right, I won't do the menu...
I don't think you realize how long it takes to do the menu, but no, it doesn't matter, I'll hang the picture now.
If the menus are late for lunch, it doesn't matter, the guests can all come and look at the picture till they are ready, right?
Lower...
Lower... up a bit...
- There!
- Thank you, dear.
Thank you so much.
I don't know where I'd be without you... in the land of the living, probably.
Yes?
Er... could we have our bill please?
Well, can you wait a minute?
Er...
I'm afraid we're a bit late for our train, we didn't get our alarm call.
Right.
I was up at five, you know, we do have staff problems.
I'm so sorry, it's all done by magic.
Basil, are you doing the menu?
No, I'm not doing the menu, dear.
I am doing the bill for these charming people who are in a hurry.
I'm sorry to cause all this trouble, but the reason we're late is we didn't get our alarm call.
Oh dear, I am sorry.
Basil, why didn't they get their alarm call?
Because I forgot!
I am so sorry I am not perfect!
There you are, there's the bill.
Perhaps you'd pay my wife, I have to put the picture up...
If there aren't any dustbins to be cleaned out...
Newspapers!
Goodbye.
See you again!
Don't forget the picture, Basil.
I won't, dear, leave it to me.
I'm going out now.
I expect it to up when I get back.
Drive carefully, dear...
Ah, good morning, Major.
Morning, Fawlty.
I do apologise for the tardiness of the arrival of your newspaper this morning, Major.
I will speak to them again, see if something can be done.
Ah, more strikes...
Dustmen...
Post Office...
It makes you want to cry, doesn't it?
What's happened to the old ideal of doing something for your fellow man, of service?
- I mean, today...
- Mr. Fawlty?
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming!
They treat you like dirt, you know...
Of course it's pure ignorance, but with the class of guests one gets nowadays...
Ah!
D'olivera made a hundred!
Did he?
Did he really?
Good for him, good old Dolly.
Well, well, well...
Thank you, Polly.
We're only staying till Sunday!
Right, thank you...
Ah, I thought you were going out, dear.
What's this?
I decided, Sybil, to advertise.
I...
How much did it cost?
Oh...
I haven't... fifteen?
- Forty.
- Forty.
I have told you where we advertise.
Sybil, I know the hotel business.
No you don't, Basil.
Sybil, we've got to try to attract a better class of person.
Why?
Well, we're losing tone.
We're making money.
- Yes, yes...
- Just.
Yes, but now we can try to build up a higher class of clientele!
Turn away some of the riff-raff.
So long as they pay their bills, Basil.
Is that all that matters to you, Sybil?
Money?
This advertisement is a waste of forty pounds.
One moment!
One moment, please!
- Well?
- Well?
My dear woman, Sir Richard and Lady Morris, arriving this evening.
For two nights.
You see, they saw the advertisement in Country Life.
I wish they were staying a week.
Well, so do I...
Might pay for the ad then.
Sybil, look!
If we can attract this class of customer,
I mean... the sky's the limit!
Basil, twenty-two rooms is the limit!
I mean, have you seen the people in room six?
They've never even sat on chairs before.
They are the commonest, vulgarest, most horrible, nasty...
'Allo!
Got a room?
I beg your pardon?
Got a room for tonight, mate?
I shall have to see, sir...
- Single?
- Yeah.
No, make it a double, I feel lucky today!
- 'Allo...
- Good morning.
Only joking.
- No we haven't.
- What?
No we haven't any rooms.
Good day...
Number seven is free, Basil.
What?
...oh...
Mr Tone is in number seven, dear.
No, he left while you were putting the picture up, Basil...
You have luggage, sir?
Just one case.
In the car...
the white sports.
Fill this in, would you, sir?
If you can.
I hope you enjoy your stay, Mr Brown.
Er, Manuel, would you fetch this gentleman's case from the car outside?
Take it to room seven.
- Is not easy for me.
- What?
Is not easy for me... entender.
Ah!
It's not easy for you to understand.
Manuel...
We're training him.
He's from Barcelona.
In Spain.
Obtener la valisa...
Que?
La valisa en el, er, auto bianco sportiv.
Y... a la sala... siete... por favor.
Pronto.
Is impossible.
- What?
- Is impossible.
Look, it's perfectly simple!
Manuel - sirvase buscar mi equipaje que esta en el automovil blanco y lo traer a la sala numero siete.
Senor, habla espanol!
Solo un poco, lo siento.
Pero he olvidado mucho.
No, no, habla muy bien.
Muy muy bien.
Formidable!
Gracias, gracias.
Lo voy a coger ahora.
Wel, if there's anything else, I'm sure Manuel will be able to tell you... as you seem to get on so well together.
Key?
Hallo dear... just doing the picture.
Don't forget the menu.
I beg your pardon?
Don't forget the menu.
I thought you said you wanted...
Right!
I'll do the menu.
You could have had them both done by now if you hadn't spent the whole morning skulking in there listening to that racket.
Racket?
That's Brahms!
Brahms's Thrid Racket!
The whole morning!
I had two bars.
Ready to order?
Er, yeah.
What's a gralefrit?
Grapefruit.
And creme pot... pot rouge?
Portugaise.
Tomato soup.
I'll have the gralefrit.
Now - balm carousel...
lamb?
Casserole.
Sounds good.
Does it come with a smile?
It comes with sprouts or carrots.
Oh, smile's extra, is it?
You'll get one if you eat up all your sprouts.
Waiter!
I beg your pardon?
Oh, 'allo.
Can I have some wine please?
The waiter is busy, sir, but I will bring you the carte des vins when I have finished attending to this gentleman.
Oh, fine - no hurry.
Oh, good, how nice, how very thoughtful.
I trust the beer is to your satisfaction, sir?
Yes, fine.
Ah, good.
May I wish you bon apetit?
Manuel!
Si, Senor.
Would you fetch the wine list please?
Si, senor.
- The wine list.
- Si?
- The wine... vino.
- Senor.
No, no.
The list!
There, there, the list!
The list, there!
The red... there!
There!
'Ave you got a half bottle of the Beaujolais?
Yes.
Oh, fine.
Right!
Never mind!
Never mind!
Manuel, another grapefruit for table twelve please.
Manuel!
I do beg your pardon...
I'm so sorry...
- No!
...
Throw it away.
- Que?
Throw... it... away!
Throw... it... away?
Throw it away!
Now!
Sorry!
Sorry, sorry!
Sorry about that.
Sorry about that.
No, I like a bit of cabaret.
You left your sketch.
Oh!
Sorry.
It's very good.
Do you sell any?
Enough to keep me in waitressing.
One half bottle of Beaujolais.
Sybil!
Someone at reception, dear.
Yes, yes, well, yes?
Er, well, I was wondering if you could offer me accomodation for a few nights?
Well, have you booked?
- I'm sorry?
- Have you booked?
- No.
- Oh dear!
Why, are you full?
Oh, we're not full...
We're not full.
Of course we're not full!
- I'd like, er...
- One moment, one moment, please... yes?
- A single room with a...
- Your name, please, could I have your name?
- Melbury.
- One second please.
Hello?
Ah, yes Mr O'Reilly, well it's perfectly simple.
When I asked you to build me a wall,
I was rather hoping that instead of just dumping the bricks in a pile, you might have found time to cement them together...
You know, one on top of another, in the traditional fashion.
Could you fill it in, please?
Oh, splendid!
Ah, yes, but when, Mr. O'Reilly?
There - there!
Yes, but when?
Yes, yes...
Ah!
The flu!
Both names, please.
Yes, I should have guessed, Mr. O'Reilly, that and the potato famine I suppose...
I beg your pardon?
Would you put both your names, please?
Well, will you give me a date?
Er...
I only use one.
You don't have a first name?
No, I am Lord Melbury, so I simply sign myself 'Melbury'.
Go away.
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting, your lordship...
I do apologise, please forgive me.
Now, was there something, is there something, anything, I can do for you?
Anything at all?
Well, I have filled this in...
Oh, please don't bother with that.
Now, a special room?
... a single?
A double?
A suite?
Well, we don't have any suites, but we do have some beautiful doubles with a view...
No, no, just a single.
Just a single.
Absolutely!
How very wise if I may say so, your honour.
With a bath.
Naturally, naturally!
Naturellement!
I shall be staying for one or two nights.
Oh please!
Please!
...
Manuel!
Well, it's... it's rather grey today, isn't it?
Oh, yes, it is, rather.
Of course usually down here it's beautiful, but today is a real old... er... rotter.
Manuel!
Still... it's good for the wheat.
Yes, er, I suppose so.
Oh yes!
I hear it's coming along wonderfully at the moment!
Thank God!
I love the wheat...
There's no sight like a field of wheat waving in the... waving in...
Manuel!
Well, how are you?
I mean if it's not a personal question.
Well, it is a personal --
Let me take your cases for you, please allow me...
Oh, thank you very much.
- They're just outside.
- Splendid.
Thank you so much.
I won't be one moment...
Ah, Lord Melbury.
May I introduce my wife?
Yes, we have met.
My wife, may I introduce your lordship?
Thank you, Basil, we've sorted it out.
Splendid, splendid.
I wonder, could I deposit this case with you?
It's just a few valuables.
Valuable, of course.
Please let me take it now.
I'll put it in the safe straight away.
Sybil, would you put this in the safe, please?
I'm just off to the kitchen, Basil.
Yes, well, if you're too busy...
Nice to have met you, Lord Melbury.
- I hope you enjoy your stay.
- Thank you so much.
Yes, well I'll do it then, then I'll do the picture...
I'll put this away in one moment, your lord.
Manuel, , will you take these cases to room twenty-one?
Que?
Take... to room... twenty-one.
No entender.
Prenda las casos en-- oh, doesn't matter.
Right!
I'll do it, I'll do it.
Thank you Manuel.
- I take them.
- No, no, go away!
- Que?
- Go and wait!
- Wait?
In there!
Go and wait in there!
Go and be a waiter in there!
I do apologise, your lordship.
I'm afraid he's only just joined us.
It'd be quicker to train a monkey.
Do please follow me...
I mean, if you're ready.
There's no hurry.
Oh yes, yes, fine.
Excuse me, I'm so sorry to bother you.
Would you mind moving to that table?
What?
Could I ask you please to move to that table over there?
But...
I'm so sorry to trouble you.
- We're halfway through...
- Thank you so much.
This is Lord Melbury's table, you see.
- What?
- Lord Melbury.
When he stays with us he always sits at this table.
Well, why did they put us here?
Ah, an oversight... on my wife's part.
I'm so sorry.
He's just arrived, you see.
Would you mind?
Polly!
Would you help these people to that table?
Thank you, thank you so much.
Come on!
Come on!
Thank you.
Ah, Lord Melbury!
Do please come this way...
your lordship...
I have your table over here by the window as usual.
Just here.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, thank you very much.
I'm so sorry!
Oh my Lord!
Oh my God!
I think he's killed him!
Get on with your meals!
Thank you so much.
Lord Melbury, I really must apologise again for...
Please, please, think nothing of it.
- But it was so...
- No, no, no.
Please!
It was the smallest of accidents.
It could have occurred anywhere.
- Yes, but...
- No, no, no, I've forgotten all about it.
That's most...
You're really... er, your lordship, would you allow me to offer you dinner here tonight... as our guest?
That's extremely kind of you.
Unfortunately I have an engagement tonight...
- Oh!
- Oh actually...
- Yes?
- There is one thing.
Good!
Good!
I was wondering...
Can you cash me a small cheque?
I'm playing golf this afternoon.
Oh, delighted!
And I'd rather not go into the town.
Absolutely...
I mean, er, how much?
Er, if it's not a rude question?
Er well... er... could you manage... fif...
Oh!
...a hundred?
A... h... hundred?
Oh absolutely...
Oh yes, I mean, will a hundred be enough?
I mean a hundred and fifty... two...
two... er, a hundred and sixty?
Let's see, that's, er, dinner tonight... few tips...
Oh, and it's the weekend, isn't it?
Is two hundred all right?
Oh!
Oh!
Please!
Yes!
Oh, ha, ha!
- oh, tremendous!
Oh...
I'm so happy!
I'll send someone to the town straightaway and have it for you when you get back.
Yes, well, that would be splendid.
Thank you, thank you, your lordship.
Thank you so much.
Oh, not at all, my privilege...
What breeding...
Sheer...
Oh!
Hallo, dear.
- What are you doing?
- I'm kissing you, dear.
Well, don't.
Just thought it might be nice to...
I heard about lunch.
What?
...
Oh, that!
Oh, think nothing of it.
What?
It was the smallest of accidents.
Could have occurred anywhere.
Anywhere?
First you move that nice family in the middle of their meal, and then you attack Lord Melbury with a chair!
Look, Sybil,
I've had a word with Lord Melbury about it.
He was quite charming...
Oh, it's delightful to have people like that stay here... sheer class, golf, baths, engagements, a couple of hundr... h, h, horses...
Well, I've never seen such tatty cases.
Of course you haven't.
It's only the upper class class that would have tat like that that.
It's the whole point!
- Oh, you don't know what I'm talking about.
- No I don't.
But don't ever move guests in the middle of a meal again and get that picture up.
Sour old rat.
Ah!
Polly.
Would you do me a favour?
When you're down in town this afternoon... just between ourselves, don't mention it to my wife... pop into the bank and just...
Could someone answer that, please?
Hallo!
Is there nobody who can answer that?
There must be someone.
Not you.
I'll never get it up.
I'll cancel my holiday.
Do it then.
Hallo, Fawlty Towers?
Hallo, Fawlty Towers.
Oh, hello, Brenda.
Basil, it's six o'clock.
Ah, Polly...
Did you cash it?
- Yes, er...
Mr Fawlty?
- Good, good.
- Could I have a word with you?
- What?
Could I speak to you in the office for just a minute?
- Not now Polly!
- It's very important, I...
- Later!
Later!
- Basil!
- I'm just going, dear..
Thank you, thank you so much, Polly.
Ah, good evening, Major.
Evening, Fawlty.
The usual?
Er... er... oh, why not, indeed.
Why not?
I've just been been watching one of those nature films on television.
Oh yes?
Did you know that a female gibbon gestates for seven months?
Seven months?
Well I never...
There you are, Major...
Seven...
My word.
Ah, good evening, Mr Wareing.
A gin and orange, a lemon squash and a scotch and water please.
Certainly.
Is there any part of the room you'd like us to keep away from?
What?
We'll be over there, then.
Seven!
Well, well...
Evening, Fawlty.
Ah, good evening, Lord Melbury.
- Anywhere?
- Yes, anywhere, anywhere...
Your lordship, may I offer you a little apertif... as our guest?
That's very kind of you...
Dry sherry if you please.
What else?
Such... oh, I don't know what...
Je ne sais quoi?
Exactly!
Exactly!
Ah, there you are, Sybil.
Good evening, Major.
Evening, Mrs Fawlty.
There you are, your lordship.
Ah, thank you very much.
I see my little collection of coins tickles your interest.
What?
Oh, yes, yes.
All British Empire of course.
Used to be quite a hobby of mine.
Little investment too...
Quite... oh...
Talking about, er...
- Did you manage to...
- Oh yes..
Here you are, your lordship.
Oh, thank you, yes.
Oh yes, you know, these sorts of things, their value's soared this last couple of years.
Have they really?
Yes, yes.
You take my advice.
Get them revalued, and insure them for the full amount.
Yes, yes, I will.
Can't take any risks nowadays, I'm afraid.
- No, no, quite.
- Well, I must be off.
Thank you, thank you, your lordship.
I'll certainly...
Basil!
Yes, yes, I was just talking to Lord Melbury, dear...
A gin and orange, a lemon squash, and a scotch and water, please!
I do apologise, I was just talking to Lord...
Fawlty!
I was just thinking...
I'm having dinner tonight with the Duke of Buckleigh...
Do you know him?
Not... presonally, no.
Oh... well, he's a great expert, you know, Sotheby's and all that...
Is he?
Well, if you liked,
I could take them with me, ask him to have a quick look at them and find out their current value.
- Would... would you really?
- Yes, yes, certainly.
Well, I'll be off in a few moments.
- Well, that's really... so incredibly... er...
- Basil!
I'm talking to Lord Melbury!
A... gin... and orange... a lemon squash...
and a scotch and water please!
All right!
All right!
Oh, Mr. Fawlty...
Was that Lord Melbury?
Has he gone?
I rang...
Mr Fawlty, I must speak with you.
- What?
Can't you see I'm busy?
- Please!
It's very important.
- Can we talk in there?
- I can't!
- Basil!
- It's very important!
I'm just dealing with something important out here, Sybil, thank you.
Yes?
Yes, right, well, yes, yes, what is it?
- It's about Lord Melbury.
- Yes?
He's not Lord Melbury...
He's a confidence trickster.
I beg your pardon?
Mr Brown told me.
Haaa!
Mr Brown's from the CID.
They've been watching Melbury because he's pulling some big con trick in the town.
They're going to arrest him when he leaves the hotel so as not to cause you embarrassment.
- But he asked me to tell you...
- Oh, how nice of him!
Please, Mr Fawlty...
Oh, I don't know what other tales
Mr Brown of MI5 has been impressing you with but...
- He's a con man!
- Oh of course.
It stands out a mile, doesn't it?
He's so common.
Unlike that cockney git whose ulterior motive will soon no doubt become apparent to you, poor innocent misguided child that you are.
- Basil, what is going on?
- Nothing, my dear, nothing at all.
- Mrs Fawlty...
- Now look!
Yes, Polly?
- I don't know what she's...
- Basil!
Mr Brown's from the CID.
He showed me his identification.
They're watching Melbury.
He's a confidence trickster.
I see.
What... what do you mean, you see?
Let's have a look at these valuables...
What are you doing, Sybil?
Sybil, I forbid you to open the safe!
Sybil, I forbid you to take that case out!
Sybil, do not open that case!
I forbid it!
I never thought I would live to see the day when a peer of the realm... entrusts to us... a case of valuables... in trust...
I'll call the police.
They're here already, Mr Brown's outside.
Someone at reception, Basil.
Ah!
...all right... er...
Ah...
Good evening.
I believe you were expecting us.
No, I was expecting somebody else.
Sir Richard and Lady Morris.
Yes, yes, them as well.
I'm sorry?
- How did you know?
- What?
Oh... you're Sir Richard and Lady Morris.
I do beg your pardon.
I was just think... er...
Now, would you mind filling this out, please?
We've given you room...
Ah hah!
Ah, Fawlty!
Mr Fawlty to you, Lord Melbury.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, nothing, please forget all about it.
Oh... er... well... here's the cheque for two hundred pounds...
Ah, thank you so much.
Now, about my priceless collection of coins...
Oh yes... er, do you still want...
Do I still want you to take them to be valued by the Duke of Buckleigh, my lord?
- Er... yes.
- No, I don't.
Because we've just heard that the Duke of Buckleigh is... dead!
Yes, he got his head knocked off by a golf ball.
Tragic!
Tragic!
Well, how are you, Lord Melbury?
'Ow are yer then?
All right, mate?
'Ow's me old mucker?
Any valuables to deposit, Sir Richard?
Any bricks?
I do apologise...
You bastard!
We've given you room twelve with the view overlooking the park...
I'm sure you'll like it...
We'll have your bags brought up...
May I introduce my wife?
Hello, Lord Melbury!
- BASTARD!
- Basil!
Please think nothing of it.
Do please excuse me one moment.
Basil, the Morrises are leaving.
Where are you going?
Where are you going?
We're leaving!
Oh, don't.
Please stay.
You'll like it here.
I've never been in such a place in my life.
You snobs!
You stupid... stuck-up...
toffee-nosed... half-witted... upper-class piles of... pus!
- Sorry, Mr. Fawlty.
- Oh just one, please.
Sorry, Mr. Fawlty.
Well, I'd better put the picture up.
Oh... thank you Polly for the...
- Well done, Manuel.
- Que?
Oh...
Ole.
I'm sorry about that, Mr Fawlty... can I buy you a drink?
No, no, I'd better put this up, I suppose.
Basil!
A gin and orange... a lemon squash... and a scotch and water please!
Right!
Come on, then!
I am leaving the office now.
I don't know, Karen.
We'll talk about it when I get home, ok?
Why don't you go back to sleep?
Ok.
Love you too.
These late friday nights have killed my social life.
I'm gonna give you a ride.
You can pretend we're on a date.
How pathetic am I, that I think that's a sweet idea?
- Hey, it's late.
- I'm leaving soon.
- I can stick around if you want.
- That's ok, I'm fine.
You have somewhere to be.
Right.
Ok, then.
- See ya.
- Bye.
- Vodka rocks.
- Any special kind?
Don't know yet.
Hey, you.
Who would you like to be?
What?
Rick Byers, personal manager.
Rick Byers Entertainment.
A card here somewhere...
Yeah, I used to be an agent, with CAA.
But, you know...
Politics.
Anyway, seriously, I...
I really think I could do something with you.
For you.
No, I'm really flattered but...
I'm just not interested.
And...
I'm not really in the mood for company.
No, you see, your mouth says that.
But your eyes, they say something different, you know.
No, I...
They're pretty much in agreement.
You see, the eyes always tell the truth.
And your eyes are amazing.
Are those contacts?
My buddies over there bet me 100 box I couldn't get a kiss out of you.
So how would you like to make a easy pick?
- What's this?
- You like the ice melt.
It's the way to treat a premium vodka.
So, what are you looking for?
Looking for?
Yeah, you've been sitting in the same spot all night.
I'm just getting the feeling that this isn't...
Forget it, forget it.
No.
What feeling?
Just that you're not what you seem.
Like this is some personality you adopt as a way to protect yourself.
Now, you're looking for something or someone, maybe, but...
You won't now what it is til you find it.
That's impressive.
You know what?
Behind a bar...
You become a keen observer of the human animal.
I bet you see a lot, from back there.
Pretty everything.
Just so you know, that's my lucky shirt.
I think it's working for you.
Hey!
- FBI, hands on your head.
- What?
Now!
Do it, don't move.
Get on the car.
- What the hell is this?
- Shut up.
What are you doing?
I didn't give the word.
Didn't think you could with the suspect's tongue jammed on your throat.
What's the problem?
I screwed up, it's not our guy.
- What?
- He doesn't fit the profile.
Our UNSUB's impotent.
This one clearly doesn't have a problem in that department.
What do you think went wrong?
I don't know.
Everything said that he was gonna be there and...
I couldn't spot him.
Maybe he's breaking pattern, you know, taking the night off.
I loved it.
It was...
It was good, great...
I'm sorry.
It's the best I ever...
Wait.
Wait!
God, no!
No!

Why did you pick him?
He was the bartender.
Would have been easy for him to spike their drinks, would know where the cameras were.
He said something about being able to see everything, which suggested an agressive ego.
I wasn't attracted to him.
Ok.
Though that wouldn't be unheard of.
Or necessarily wrong, I mean, it's ok to...
You know, once in a while, let you... feel...
Feel what?
It's mine.
Ryan.
Ok, we'll be right up.
That's Mel, she's got the vic's ex upstairs.
Husband or boyfriend?
Am I a person of interest?
A person of...
Oh, no, you're not a suspect.
We just thought maybe you could help.
Tell me what was going on in Jesse's life.
Jesse's life was... complicated.
Going to clubs a lot, dating a lot?
I guess you would call it dating.
I don't know a lot of names.
She probably didn't either.
- Men and women?
- Women.
Men were around, but they were just there to be eyes.
Eyes?
She'd take me to straight clubs.
She liked when men watched, knowing it turned them on.
Sometimes, 4-5 men would line up watching.
But two women together...
With the hint that at least one of them is gay.
And men would stand there, staring like stimulated cattle.
You know?
They weren't all gay.
Talked to some boyfriends.
Seems like our latest victim, Jessica Dobrennin, was the only exclusively gay woman.
But we didn't look closely enough at the others.
Hadley Marsten sometimes identified herself as bisexual, and the other two had histories which could suggest they were open to experimentation.
Omnivors.
Interesting.
Carter, I need you to go over every frame of the security camera footage the night the victims went missing.
- This time, we're looking...
- We're looking for a woman.
Yeah.
Danny and Paul, go with him.
You two, talk to Rebecca's bartender.
Maybe he saw more than the cameras.
He's not my bartender.
A mineral water.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Remember us?
- Yeah.
You're the one with the SWAT team, right?
I'm sorry about the mess.
I'm just getting ready to head out to work.
Not that one has anything to do with the other.
- Mr Hall, we'd just like to ask you...
- Corey, please.
And it's Rebecca, right?
Or is it even legal to call you that now?
Uh, no, Rebecca's fine.
Which is what got you into trouble.
Sorry.
We're hoping you can tell us something about the regulars who frequent the Pyramid Club.
We're looking for lesbians.
It's not like we get a lot of gay women at Pyramid, but... this is L.A.
Quite a list of last names you've got there.
Yeah, well, you know, I do see their IDs.
So, is this like a serial killer case?
Doesn't have to get to that level whatever before FBI gets involved?
We really can't tell you any more than we already have.
That's cool.
It's just, you know, your world's so much different than mine.
Kinda fascinates me.
Probably not a world you wanna know.
- Oh, I don't know about that...
- Thank you so much for your time.
I hope we haven't you made you too late to work.
Oh, no, not yet.
Ok.
Hey, so, if I think of any more names, how would I... contact you?
You can reach her here.
Anytime.
No, not here.
Oh, shy girl.
That's adorable.
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I just feel a little weird.
A little sick too...
Shh, I'll take care of you.
- Hey.
- Come on sweetheart, get in.
Ok girl, let me sit you right up here.
Oh, you got a good one this time, baby.
No, I have to go somewhere else.
Who are you?
Must be... oh!
What do we have?
Four nights, four victims.
The last images of any of these women alive.
First time we went through these, we not only established they left the club by themselves but that no man followed them out.
Now that out profile shifted ?
Carter?
See who's behind the door.
Evening of May 14th.
Hadley Marsten.
Our first victim appears at Pyramid at 1:40 a.m.
12 seconds later...
Victim 2, night 2:
she leaves at 11:18 p.m. and 14 secondes later...
Night of the 21st, Eve Yubine leaves out early.
8:48 p.m. 15 seconds later...
Jessica Dobrennin, our latest victim.
11 seconds after, she heads out to the parking lot.
She waits for her to clear the door, then the camera.
- Then she follows.
- And who is she?
Still working on it.
She didn't want her picture taken.
People, there are 6 security cameras in that building and she didn't avoid all of them.
Find her.
So, any luck with Mr Happy Pants?
Got a list of possibilities,
I'll start running it down and see if any of them are... about 5.6, long brown hair and a blurry face.
Who's she looking at?
Almost there.
Almost there.
Good girl.
- Ok, you hold her for a second.
- Roddy, she's heavy!
Did I ask you?
No, I did not.
Come on baby, come on.
That's right.
We're gonna rest over here for a little bit.
All right, that's good.
All right.
Good, slide her onto our mark, Piggy.
That's right.
Gotta get you in the light, baby.
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Give me your lipstick.
I wanna draw on her.
Baby?
Tonight, will you do some stuff to me, too?
I'll lie real still, just like her.
Yeah, right.
Who's gonna hold the camera?
Oh, yeah.
Good girl.
Allison.
Allison!
Come on, honey.
Hey.
It's important, ok?
I want you to hold the camera really still this time.
Don't let the picture shake.
Ok?
I want you to do it right.
Good girl.
Vickie!
You gotta get those clothes off, baby.
Come here.
Hey!
Come on!
We're gonna make a TV show.
So now we have a face.
Well actually we think we have two faces.
The clearest example is on last friday's footage.
The female UNSUB with Jessica Dobrennin.
And... watch her eyes.
And follow that loving look.
- UNSUB number two.
- Number one.
He's dominant.
She's trying to please him.
She's doing it all to please him.
He tells her with his eyes whether the catch is good.
Plenty of chances to slip a tranq into her drink.
Promises of a wild night, she can do whatever she wants.
Our girl likes to be told what to do.
Makes an excuse... bathroom.
Says to meet in the parking lot, outside.
First the vic...
A few seconds later, she leaves...
Minutes later, he leaves.
- We need to find these people.
- I think I know where to start.
Turn her up!
Come on, come on, little Piggy, turn her up.
Boy, you just can't stay away from me, can you?
We need you to ID this man and woman for us.
I thought you were looking for lesbians.
I mean, after you realized you weren't looking for an impotent man.
It's... couples, now.
You sure this isn't just some elaborated ruse so you can keep visiting me?
Could you look at the pictures, please?
- That's Allison.
- Allison...?
Davis.
And her husband Roddy.
- You know them?
- I know her.
Or... did.
Roddy Davis, that name sounds familiar.
"Don't miss the bus", sitcom, early 90s.
- He played the fat kid.
Yeah.
- That Roddy Davis?
Roddy the Hard Buddy, now.
Allison was obsessed with him as a kid, she moved out here to find him, and when she did, they just sort of take over each other's lives.
She got him to lose weight on some zen diet.
How do you know so much about them?
Ok.
Ally tried to leave him about 6 months ago, she ended up on my couch for a couple of months.
You slept with her.
Look, I was just trying to be a good guy.
Hence...
Yeah.
She came on to me.
Her whole life she'd only ever been with Roddy, and that guy's scary.
She told me he forces her into threesomes, he has her like hypnotized or something, he owns her.
It was ugly situations, really twisted.
Carter.
Yeah.
Listen, I need an address of an Allison and Roddy Davis.
Yeah, tell Web we're gonna need back up at the residence.
Thanks.
Look at me!
Please...
Please, don't hurt me any more.
Help me...
Quiet, quiet.
It's ok, I'm gonna get you out of here.
- My God, he's awake.
- Oh, God!
Don't hurt me, please!
- Too late, too late.
- No!
Please don't stop.
Sorry, sorry.
I don't have any choice.
Please, don't stop, please don't.
- Step out of the car.
- FBI, you're ok.
You're safe.
How's she?
Is she ok?
She's at the hospital.
A long way from ok.
I don't know what she was doing on that road, but...
I thought she might get hit, that's why I stopped...
You didn't pick her up on the road, you picked her up in a bar.
I don't know what she told you, but...
I'm not a dyke or anything.
You're not a man, either.
She says it was a man who raped her.
Repeatedly.
What?
That's crazy.
She told us everything.
How she met you in the club, Roddy in the parking lot, how she was assaulted for hours and then scrubbed clean of evidence...
And how you helped her get away.
She thinks you saved her life.
She says if you hadn't helped her out of there, that she'd be dead.
She's right, isn't she?
Cause when he's finished with them, they don't survive.
Do they?
They didn't know how to survive.
Not like you.
She'll give him to us.
She wants to give him to us.
We don't need her to give him to us.
We should be arresting Roddy right now for aggravated rape.
And that's all we'll get him for.
You don't think we'd find enough evidence in that house for all 4 murders?
Maybe if we find the shotgun he used to cover up the rapes...
Or we could arrest him, make him famous again, let him walk, and watch the jury ask for his autograph on his way out.
You're feeling confident about this, Rebecca?
She may be an accomplice, but she's an accomplice that wants out.
I say we play on that, we play to win.
Ok.
Have Danny make the offer.
Ok, remember.
If he asks where you've been all night...
He won't.
He's probably not even up yet.
I don't know if I can do this.
It's ok to be scared.
It'll work with your cover story.
I guess.
Vickie got away, you're afraid he'll get caught.
That's what you open with.
- He's smart, he's gonna know.
- Hey, we'll be here, listening.
The second he acknowledges those murders, we're on him.
Oh, God, this is...
I don't know.
Stop thinking, start walking.
We're wasting time.
Hey, Piggy.
Hi.
Did you just wake up?
I'm hungry.
You get any food?
Roddy?
We need to talk.
Vickie got away.
What do you mean?
I'm afraid she'll talk.
None of them talk.
They serve their purpose, and they return to their place in the universe.
They don't affect us, baby.
They're for us.
- Hello?
- Special Agent Rebecca?
- Corey.
- Yeah, uh...
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Uh...
I was just thinking about last night when you stopped by.
I just wanted to clarify something.
Ok.
I don't sleep around a lot.
What?
I'm not a club hound.
I just work there.
And this whole thing with Allison Davis, it's special circumstances.
Are you ready for this, little Piggy?
Can you call back later?
Thanks.
That's a really really big deal.
I know.
I'm ready.
Good.
You look beautiful.
You look beautiful.
What the...
You are beautiful.
Go ahead.
Go in.
Now.
- Living room's clear.
- Kitchen's clear.
Mel, check the bedroom.
My physical body... permanent soul... of a soul property and...
- What's this word?
- Chattel.
It means like slave.
Read more.
- She played us.
- House is empty.
Probably ran down the hill into the scrub.
I'm putting on an APB.
They won't get far.
It's ok, sweetie, it's ok.
?
Ok?
What's ok?
It's only that was the FBI!
And they know about us!
Roddy Davis, 2 firearms registered in his name, a 45 and a shotgun, nothing else in the house.
- Oh, my God.
- They filmed the rapes.
She must be running the camera.
That's Jessica Dobrennin.
The one that liked it when guys watched.
She's not liking this.
Scan ahead, see if they give us the murders.
Yes, Sir.
Shh, come on, I can get you out of here.
You're...
You're with him.
We have to go now.
Just... quiet, shh.
She thought Allison was rescuing her.
Just like we thought she was rescuing Vickie Armstrong.
She takes'em up into the hills, probably has a shotgun stashed up there.
This is why we haven't found it on her last night.
Roddy didn't kill these women.
Probably didn't even know about'em.
He does now.
Oh, my God!
- My God!
- I wanted to tell you so many times!
But I thought that maybe you knew, maybe you liked it...
Allison...
What have you done?
- You sank our battleship!
- I didn't started any of this.
I didn't want this.
You wanted it!
Trying to hang your Manson act on me?
Uh?
Trailer park Pap smear!
Those girls aren't...
I couldn't let them be!
Not after they touched you, after...
After they had you...
It's ok, it's ok if you need to be with other women, I just...
I need a little room so that I can express myself too.
My wifey.
Under the Hollywood sign.
With a shotgun stuck up on a horse.
Expressing her feelings!
No, please!
Please, please don't laugh at me.
You can do anything you want.
Little Piggy!
Little piggy-pig.
Little pig.
Piggy...
I'm sorry, baby.
I've been mean.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you felt that way.
It all started a year ago when you left.
When you cheated, you've hurt us in a karmacally profound way.
I'm so sorry.
I guess I wanted to hurt you back.
How are we ever gonna be even again?
We gotta restore balance.
How?
I think I have an idea.
We got APBs out city wide.
Airports, bus stations are covered.
This can only end one way.
I don't know.
I'm afraid we may have lit a fuse.
Rebecca, that fuse was lit a long time ago.
We may have driven them closer together.
Started to spree.
Corey, not now.
Maybe I should stop trying to profile relationships, since I clearly know nothing about them.
Tell him that.
Please leave a message at the top.
Rebecca?
Or...
G-Woman ?
Or whatever.
I'm not calling for a date, I promise.
Finally I got the message, eventually.
But, uh...
You were here last night looking for Roddy and Allison, and...
Well, they're here, now.
I thought you might wanna know.
Ok, see you.
Last call.
Can I get you something else?
No?
You're sure you don't want a double shot?
This is awesome.
Hey, I wish we could have brought a camera.
Maybe he has one.
Yeah.
Hey, bartender boy, you got a video camera?
No?
Guess we'll just have to remember it.
Are you sure this is what you want?
Oh, baby, of course I'm sure.
I told you I've been too selfish.
I wanna do this for you.
- For us.
- For us?
For us.
- Let's do it in front of him.
- Yeah.
No.
Let's kill him... and then we'll do it on him.
Ok, ok.
But first, I wanna watch you have fun.
The way that you watched me.
- You wanna watch me?
- Yeah, I wanna watch you.
- Then we'll kill him.
- Yeah, together.
Like we should do everything.
All right, thank you.
I just posted 2 agents outside Vickie Armstrong's room.
We might wanna head there ourselves.
You think Psycho and Clyde are gonna go after her?
I don't know, maybe.
When we saved Vickie, it broke Allison's pattern.
We prevented her from expressing her rage at seeing Roddy with another woman.
Why can't this fruitcake take out her anger like a normal wife, cut off her husband's wrinkle beast, chuck it in a field?
Or... sleep with another guy.
The revenge screw, always dependable.
Yeah, been on the right side of a few of those myself.
- Ew!
- What?
Doing my part keeping the city rage-free.
But did you say "wrinkle beast"?
- Wrinkle beast.
- You said wrinkle beast.
- Wrinkle beast, everyone.
- Wrinkle beast.
You have one new message.
Rebecca?
Or...
G-Woman?
What's wrong, Corey?
You remember this, don't you?
From when you tried to take me away from Roddy, uh?
And we did it, right?
Over there.
You were such a nice guy, weren't you?
Such a nice, nice guy.
Oh, yeah.
But you made a mistake, mmh?
Cause I'm Roddy's girl.
We're soulmates.
And we, we are not nice.
Ok.
Ok, that's enough fun!
Enough fun.
Now it's my turn.
- Roddy?
- Shut up.
- Roddy!
- What?
That's them, that's the FBI.
- Clear.
- He's inside.
We have a hostage.
You get any closer and we kill him!
- Need to get around the back.
- Ok, wait for my signal.
I have the power.
I have the power!
- I am the power.
- You are.
Shut up!
Hello?
Allison, this is Special Agent Locke with the FBI.
We're calling from right outside the house.
Get out of here or we'll kill Corey.
Ok, Allison, but how do we know you haven't already?
We heard shot.
- They think we shot him already.
- Damn it!
Ok, ok.
Help!
Help!
I'm alive!
Help, please!
Ok.
Next time you doubt my word, someone will die.
We are heavily armed, and we'll take this fight to you!
I'm in charge, here.
You understand?
- Yes.
- Say it!
- I understand.
- Good.
I have a list of basic truths.
They're not demands.
Cause demands are negotiable.
These truths simply are.
We'll need passports.
- He's terrified, he's at the edge.
- This is gonna end bad.
I have an idea.
Hostage trade.
- Me for Corey.
- No.
Give me the phone.
And 10 million dollars in unmarked non sequential bills... delivered in a silver attaché-case.
I will agree to all your demands.
- If you just accept one of ours.
- These are not demands!
Well, what?
Ok.
Step in.
Come on, step inside.
That's right.
Keep your hands up.
Here, here.
If he moves, shoot him.
You're stupid.
You know that?
You're really stupid.
- Now we have two hostages.
- No.
- Now it's over.
- What?
Did you ever read the Dr Seuss' book "All the places we'll go"?
Because the places you're going are Pelican Bay and Valley State.
Kidnapping Corey is 10 years each.
If you kill him tonight it's 1st degree murder for the shooter, it's 2nd degree for the other.
That's 25 to life, plus another 100 or so for the four rapes.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what do I get if I kill you?
You die tonight.
There's a man on the other side of that door that will see to it.
But nobody has to die here tonight.
Not you or your wife, not Corey...
Not me.
We can all walk out of here.
No.
Look.
If you release Corey onto my custody, it will demonstrate to the court that you have the capacity for mercy.
It'll go a long way toward softening the sentence on the four murders.
You will stay in one place for the rest of your life, but you'll be able to write to each other.
No.
Roddy!
We'll never see each other.
I didn't kill those girls.
We know you did, Roddy.
We found your Ithica 37 in a plastic bag at the kill sites.
No!
That's...
that's because she took it!
Allison took it.
She did the killings.
Did you check the fingerprints?
Because I didn't kill anyone, man.
I didn't even know she did.
- Roddy?
- Shut up, Allison!
I'm done being controlled by you.
He's right.
It's over.
It's her.
I swear.
I just had sex with them, man.
I thought she was just dropping them off back home.
She's obsessed with me.
When she moved out here, I felt bad for her and I cared for her, but I only married her because she threatened to kill herself.
Not true.
It was abuse.
Remote emotional abuse.
Can't you see it?
- I was scared.
- Everything will be ok, Roddy.
- It'll be ok.
- Yeah.
She needs help.
It's a sickness.
I won't judge her.
I'll testify.
Ok.
You finally shot the right person.
Let's end it now, shall we?
Sit down.
Ok, let me take this off.
What happened?
Mrs Davis shot her husband and surrendered to me.
What did you say to him?
Actually...
He did most of the talking.
Are you all right?
You kept it together.
Not all kidnapping victims are that smart about it.
They panick, causing their abducters to do the same.
We don't...
have to talk about this here.
We could do it some other time over... a drink or something, or coffee.
- Agent Locke...
- Rebecca.
Rebecca...
You remember when you said that I wouldn't wanna know your world?
You were right.
I think I wanna be alone.
Please.
Of course.
[Singing] It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex on TV
But where are those good old-fashioned values
On which we used to rely?
Lucky there's a family guy
Lucky there's a man who Positively can do
All the things that make us
Laugh and cry
He's a family guy
There's Craig Hoffman.
He's such a rebel.
Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous.
And he plays by no one's rules but his own.
Meg, you should ask him out.
I mean, you're the only one of us who's ever had a real boyfriend.
I'm back.
I brought another picnic.
You're such a good listener.
You're not like the other boys.
You're so good with animals.
I guess I could give it a try.
All right, here goes.
Hi, Craig.
I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...
I don't know, go out sometime.
That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules besides my own... which I would never do.
I play by my own rules, nobody else's.
Not even my own.
- How about a movie?
- I don't go out with dudes.
- Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
- Of course not, sweetie.
Yeah, where'd you get a stupid idea like that?
- Craig Hoffman.
- Craig Hoffman said that?
Well, he's a sharp kid.
You might be ugly.
There, there, let me dry those tears.
Yes, your anguish sustains me.
Meg, honey, don't let those awful kids at school... make you feel bad about yourself.
I tell you what.
Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out and get you some brand new outfits.
Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans that'll show off your cute butt, huh?
Really?
Wow, thanks, Mom.
Meg in low-riders.
Enough of that.
Go away, damn you.
You're going to get it now.
Oh, my God!
Horace, what is this all about?
What the hell's it look like?
I'm putting the bar up for sale.
Please tell me this is some kind of practical joke.
Like the kind I used to play when I was an intern at the hospital.
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Your wife's gonna be a vegetable.
You'll have to bathe her, feed her and care for her the rest of her life.
Oh, my God.
No, I'm just kidding.
She's dead.
Ever since that mega-mall opened across the street... it's been taking away all my business.
They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants... 53 bars, and an indoor cattle ranch.
[Effeminately] I go to Baskin-Robbins every night and buy myself a little treat.
Now, how in the hell am I supposed to compete with that?
You need to fix the place up.
Reinvent The Clam's image and we'll help you.
That'll take forever.
Not if we do a 1980s fixing-stuff-up montage.
['80s technopop music]
GLENN:
Well, I think we made it worse.
PETER:
Boy, I do not envy whoever has to clean that mess up.
Brian, why don't you take Stewie while Meg and I go clothes shopping?
You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around the mall at my height.
- I say, let me get on your back.
- Oh, for God's sake.
Strong with the force, young Skywalker is.
- God, I don't believe this.
- That is why you fail.
What about this, Meg?
A pink baby tee that says "Little Slut?"
- That seems pretty hip.
- I don't know if that's really me, Mom.
Well, they've got one that says "Porn Star"... and another that says "Sperm Dumpster" and they're all written in glitter.
All right.
All right.
Give me "Sperm Dumpster."
That's the spirit.
- You finding everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.
- You just let me know if you need any...
- How do these jeans look?
[Salesgirl screaming]
- $10.
- $5.
- $8 and I'll do it.
- Fine.
Help, I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!
Help me!
I am so outrageous.
Give me the cash.
- Cold in here?
- Nope, just really small.
Face it, Mom.
No matter what I wear, I look ugly.
Meg, you're being...
That's...
Let's try down here.
Coming up next, Joan Rivers speaks to us from beyond the grave.
But first, let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall... where Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa... is handing out makeovers.
That's right, Tom.
Some lucky hideous woman will be transformed... by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society.
Meg, that's it.
You could get a makeover.
That'd be just the thing to boost your confidence.
Miss Takanawa!
Miss Takanawa!
Over here!
My daughter needs a makeover like there's no freaking tomorrow.
[Cameraman screaming]
It looks like we've got a winner, Tom.
- Face it, The Clam is doomed.
- Come on, guys, we can't give up now.
Peter, we've tried every theme we could think of and everything's failed.
Especially that Coyote Ugly theme.
It's no use, this place is finished.
Quagmire, go get the "For Sale" sign.
Hey, Horace, what the hell's this?
It's a karaoke machine.
I never got around to installing it.
A karaoke machine?
Wait a minute, that's it.
We'll turn this place into a karaoke bar.
Oh, man, that's the best idea since they faked the moon landing.
DIRECTOR:
Okay, cut.
Neil Armstrong.
Wait a minute.
You're supposed to be on the moon.
I just saw it on TV.
There's a... tape delay.
And solar winds...
Peter, take a look at your daughter.
Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry.
It was 20 years ago.
- I'd never even heard the word "rubber"...
- Peter, this is Meg.
Oh.
I got a makeover, Dad.
Don't I look great?
Meg, honey, I always thought you were beautiful just the way you...
God, couldn't do that with a straight face.
Welcome to the family, sweetheart.
Chris, go burn all Meg's old pictures.
[Singing The Morning After] There's got to be a morning after
We're moving closer to the shore
I know we'll be there by tomorrow
And we'll escape the darkness
We won't be searching anymore
Thank you very much.
I don't understand it.
This place should be jumping.
Well, we just need to kick it up a notch.
Horace, hit it.
[Singing Don't Stop Believin'] Just a small town girl
Living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Peter, don't make me do...
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Oh, God, I love this song.
And I love it when amateurs sing the lyrics.
But I hate baseball cards.
Some will win
Some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
The movie never ends
It goes on and on
Hey, that's Journey.
Kickass!
Howard!
That is Journey.
Streetlight people
Get some!
Get some!
Guys, we were freaking electric.
Yeah, they loved us.
Gentlemen, this is a sign.
We are gonna start our own rock band.
PETER:
Who's with me?
MEN:
I'm in.
Looks like the guys are gonna form a rock band.
Maybe they'll learn a little something.
Stick around, you just might learn something, too.
You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of drunken idiots... at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean you have what it takes to form a band.
Brian, you're just ants at a picnic.
We're gonna be awesome.
Wait.
What am I?
I'm ants at a picnic?
Is that what you just said?
I'm ants at a picnic?
All right.
Just making sure.
Sorry I'm late, fellas.
Cool, Glenn.
You look just like Tommy Lee.
Well, I figured it'd be appropriate since I just found out I got hepatitis.
You know, maybe we should have decided on outfits that matched.
Now we all look like a bunch of queers.
Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear... as long as you play kickass rock and roll and do this with your tongue.
- Am I right, Gene?
- You got that right, Pete.
[Lois giggles]
LOIS:
Oh, my.
Hi, Gene.
I didn't know you were here.
All right.
Keep it in your mouth, rock star.
[Boys whistling]
- Great job getting hot, Meg.
- Gee, thanks.
- Hey, Meg.
- Hi, Craig.
Now that you're attractive, how about we go out sometime?
Gosh, I'd love to.
Great, I'll pick you up whenever I feel like it.
Hey, Meg.
We noticed Craig Hoffman just asked you out.
That makes you cool.
Wanna hang out with us?
- Sure.
- Hey, I'm here to pick you up.
Here we are, fellas.
Our first major gig.
Peter, this is a house of corrections.
You gotta start somewhere, fellas.
That's how you evolve.
Like when the Tin Man found out he was gay.
Look what happened by accident.
I hear there's a lot of buzz about this band.
Yeah, there was a pretty positive review carved in Tony's ass.
All right, kids.
Now everyone stay together.
It's very important to your father... that we're here for his band's first performance.
The people who beat you are proud to present, all the way from Quahog...
Fat, Horny, Black and Joe.
- Hello, Cleveland!
- Hello, Peter.
One, two, three, four...
Oh, my God, we don't know any songs.
- You suck!
- Get off the stage!
What do we do?
I know what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here.
How about a funny story about Lake Wobegone?
It was the day of the tuna hot-dish jamboree...
Oh, no.
Kids, your father's in trouble.
- I'm going up there.
- I'm coming, too, Mom.
Oh, my God.
The guy behind me braided my hair.
Chris, grab a guitar.
Brian, take the drums.
Here, Stewie, play with this.
Mom, can we please just get out of here?
- Oh, my God.
- Who is she?
God, I could strangle her all night long.
Boy, that's not healthy, is it?
That that's the first place I go to?
Hit it!
[Singing] Cloudy skies and rain clouds Have come to stay
Windy nights and sad sights Won't go away
But I wanna be without a care
Unicorns and butterflies everywhere
Gonna buy me a rainbow
Gonna wrap it up in a great big bow
The time is right It's day, not night
Just open up your heart lt'll be all right
Gonna buy me a rainbow
Buy me a rainbow
You guys were great.
My name's Jimmy Iovine.
And I'd like to make you filthy rich rock stars.
Wow, you're the chairman of Interscope Records.
- What're you doing in prison?
- I stomped a cat to death.
Listen, you guys got talent.
- Well, where do we sign?
- Right here, on Tony's butt cheek.
And initial here... and here.
And date.
Oh, crap.
Today's the seventeenth.
[Singing] Gonna buy me a rainbow
Buy me a rainbow
- How was that, Dr. Ditty?
- Yo, that sounds smooth, y'all.
I just have a...
God, I'm so sorry.
I keep doing that.
God, please forgive me.
I get that from my father.
He's from a different generation.
- It's...
- Whatever, man.
- We cool?
We good?
- Yeah, we're cool.
Fine.
Mr. Doctor?
If you get shot in a rap feud... can you perform surgery on yourself?
Well, no, Chris.
My degree's in optometry.
All right, Dr. Ditty.
I got three choices for you for the name of the band:
Peter Griffin Starship, Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers... or Testicular Sound Express.
I think the name is Meg.
- Me?
Why?
- Yeah, why?
Let me explain something to you, all right?
We got to get her half-naked and put her out front, center stage.
And that's gonna make y'all billionaires... because America loves hot, white jailbait ass.
Wait a minute.
That's the smartest thing I've ever heard... anyone say about anything.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg being exploited that way.
Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision.
I want to be exploited.
Meg, don't you talk to me like that.
Look, Lois, I love Meal Ticket just as much as I love Chris and Stevie... but business is business.
So, let's get this show on the road, huh?
Good.
Now, I just need you to sign this.
Oh, God.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
That is not me.
That's not who I am.
I vote Democrat.
It will not happen again.
We cool?
We good?
You...
You guys know I have no problem with black people, right?
Yeah.
Sure.
You did say you hated Crooklyn.
- Hey, Doc, you got a minute?
- What you want, dog?
Yeah, so, hey, check it out.
Stewie and I have been working on some stuff of our own.
And we thought there might be a place for us to sing on the next album.
Hey, cool.
You're busy.
No sweat.
Boy, Benson was a funny show.
- I'll talk to you later.
- Well, what did he say?
He said he'd think about it.
Okay, so where were we?
Okay.
[Singing] I want to have intercourse with you
Intercourse with you
Relations.
Intercourse with you
- Right?
- Yeah.
No, great, that sounds good.
All right, groovy.
Now, is there a shorter word for intercourse?
Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.
- Excuse me, young lady?
- Did I freaking stutter?
- I said more Skittles.
- All right.
That is it, Meg.
You know, ever since you got that makeover... you've developed a terrible attitude.
And all the success with the family band is only making it worse.
The family band?
You know, maybe you haven't noticed, Lois, but I am the band.
- Right, Missus Wong?
- Yeah, she band.
Old lady jealous.
Peter, we have to do something.
We're losing our daughter.
I'm worried about what's happening to her.
Lois, this is the kind of thing... that always resolves itself if you just ignore it, all right?
What's more important is we're living the sweet life.
This is even more fun than when I performed at the White House.
Mr. President, I present to you Peter Griffin.
Okay, listen up, everybody.
I got great news.
Meg, you and your family are gonna perform on Saturday Night Live.
You mean I'm gonna get to meet John Belushi and Gilda Radner... and Phil Hartman, and Chris Farley, and Horatio Sanz?
Sweet!
Saturday Night Live.
I can't think of anything more exciting.
Oh, my God, a water fountain!
Meg, I'm Jimmy Fallon.
It's great to finally meet you.
I'm hosting.
Why don't you come hang out in my dressing room?
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Come on, let's go.
Peter, I'm worried about Meg.
She's spiraling out of control.
I mean, what if she develops a coke problem?
No Coke.
Pepsi.
Come on, you set me up for that one.
Wow, Jimmy.
That was everything Ladies Home Journal said it would be.
Awesome, great, thanks.
You know, there's something I...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Being with you just made me feel so...
Live from New York... it's Saturday Night!
TV HOST:
It's Saturday Night Live.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, that wasn't a very good opening sketch, was it?
- A rare miss.
- I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.
Mom, Dad, he used me for comedy.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that my daughter was deflowered... in front of one-and-a-half times the Mad TVaudience?
My poor baby.
My God, Lois, you were right.
Why the hell didn't I see it coming?
All right, stand aside.
It's about time I did my fatherly duty.
I said "duty," but no time to laugh about it now.
Hey, everybody, it's great to be back.
So we got a great show tonight and...
Hey, Fallon, say goodnight, you bum.
And this is for laughing and looking at the camera... during every sketch you've ever been in.
Who do you think you are?
Carol Burnett?
You think because she did it, it's okay for you?
You haven't earned what she's earned, buddy.
All right, now where's the guy who slept with my daughter?
I'm so glad to be the real me again.
It's too much work being beautiful.
Not for me, but it's good to have you back, pumpkin.
Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do.
Listen, thanks, everybody.
I had a great time tonight.
I want to thank Jimmy Fallon for being such a good sport.
Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris, the guys from the prison...
Counting Crows.
If I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry.
Goodnight, everybody!
Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!
TV HOST:
From the world famous Apollo Theater in Harlem... it's show time at the...
What?
I'm tired.
It has nothing to do with the fact that it's a black show.
What?
I can't be tired at 1:00 in the morning?
[Barking]
It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex on TV
But where are those good old-fashioned values
On which we used to rely?
Lucky there's a family guy
Lucky there's a man who Positively can do all the things that make us
Laugh and cry
He's a family guy
There's Craig Hoffman.
He's such a rebel.
Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous.
And he plays by no one's rules but his own.
Meg, you should ask him out.
I mean, you're the only one of us who's ever had a real boyfriend.
I'm back.
I brought another picnic.
You're such a good listener.
You're not like the other boys.
You're so good with animals.
I guess I could give it a try.
all right, here goes.
Hi, Craig.
I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...
I don't know, go out sometime.
That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules besides my own... which I would never do.
I play by my own rules, nobody else's.
Not even my own.
- How about a movie?
- I don't go out with dudes.
- Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
- Of course not, sweetie.
Yeah, where'd you get a stupid idea like that?
- Craig Hoffman.
- Craig Hoffman said that?
Well, he's a sharp kid.
You might be ugly.
There, there, let me dry those tears.
Yes, your anguish sustains me.
Meg, honey, don't let those awful kids at school... make you feel bad about yourself.
I tell you what.
Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out and get you some brand new outfits.
Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans that'll show off your cute butt, huh?
Really?
Wow, thanks, Mom.
Meg in low-riders.
Enough of that.
Go away, damn you.
You're going to get it now.
Oh, my God!
Horace, what is this all about?
What the hell's it look like?
I'm putting the bar up for sale.
Please tell me this is some kind of practical joke.
Like the kind I used to play when I was an intern at the hospital.
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Your wife's gonna be a vegetable.
You'll have to bathe her, feed her and care for her the rest of her life.
Oh, my God.
No, I'm just kidding.
She's dead.
Ever since that mega-mall opened across the street... it's been taking away all my business.
They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants... 53 bars, and an indoor cattle ranch.
I go to Baskin-Robbins every night and buy myself a little treat.
Now, how in the hell am I supposed to compete with that?
You need to fix the place up.
Reinvent The Clam's image and we'll help you.
That'll take forever.
Not if we do a 1980s fixing-stuff-up montage.
Well, I think we made it worse.
Boy, I do not envy whoever has to clean that mess up.
Brian, why don't you take Stewie while Meg and I go clothes shopping?
You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around the mall at my height.
- I say, let me get on your back.
- Oh, for God's sake.
Strong with the force, young Skywalker is.
- God, I don't believe this.
- That is why you fall.
What about this, Meg?
A pink baby tee that says "Little Slut?"
- That seems pretty hip.
- I don't know if that's really me, Mom.
Well, they've got one that says "Porn Star"... and another that says "Sperm Dumpster" and they're all written in glitter.
all right. all right.
Give me "Sperm Dumpster. "
That's the spirit.
- You finding everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.
- You just let me know if you need any-
- How do these jeans look?
- $10.
- $5.
- $8 and I'll do it.
- Fine.
Help, I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!
Help me!
I am so outrageous.
Give me the cash.
- Cold in here?
- Nope, just really small.
Face it, Mom.
No matter what I wear, I look ugly.
Meg, you're being...
That's...
Let's try down here.
Coming up next, Joan Rivers speaks to us from beyond the grave.
But first, let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall... where Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa... is handing out makeovers.
That's right, Tom.
Some lucky hideous woman will be transformed... by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society.
Meg, that's it.
You could get a makeover.
That'd be just the thing to boost your confidence.
Miss Takanawa!
Miss Takanawa!
Over here!
My daughter needs a makeover like there's no freaking tomorrow.
It looks like we've got a winner, Tom.
- Face it, The Clam is doomed.
- Come on, guys, we can't give up now.
Peter, we've tried every theme we could think of and everything's failed.
Especially that Coyote Ugly theme.
It's no use, this place is finished.
Quagmire, go get the "For Sale" sign.
Hey, Horace, what the hell's this?
It's a karaoke machine.
I never got around to installing it.
A karaoke machine?
Wait a minute, that's it.
We'll turn this place into a karaoke bar.
Oh, man, that's the best idea since they faked the moon landing.
Okay, cut.
neil Armstrong.
Wait a minute.
You're supposed to be on the moon.
I just saw it on TV.
There's a... tape delay.
And solar winds...
Peter, take a look at your daughter.
Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry.
It was 20 years ago.
- I'd never even heard the word "rubber"...
- Peter, this is Meg.
Oh.
I got a makeover, Dad.
Don't I look great?
Meg, honey, I always thought you were beautiful just the way you...
God, couldn't do that with a straight face.
Welcome to the family, sweetheart.
Chris, go burn all Meg's old pictures.
There's got to be a morning after
We're moving closer to the shore
I know we'll be there by tomorrow
And we'll escape the darkness
We won't be searching anymore
Thank you very much.
I don't understand it.
This place should be jumping.
Well, we just need to kick it up a notch.
Horace, hit it.
Just a small town girl
Living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Peter, don't make me do...
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Oh, God, I love this song.
And I love it when amateurs sing the Iyrics.
But I hate baseball cards.
Some will win
Some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
The movie never ends
It goes on and on
Hey, that's Journey.
Kickass!
Howard!
That is Journey.
Streetlight people
Get some!
Get some!
Guys, we were freaking electric.
Yeah, they loved us.
Gentlemen, this is a sign.
We are gonna start our own rock band.
Who's with me?
I'm in.
Looks like the guys are gonna form a rock band.
Maybe they'll learn a little something.
Stick around, you just might learn something, too.
You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of drunken idiots... at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean you have what it takes to form a band.
Brian, you're just ants at a picnic.
We're gonna be awesome.
Wait.
What am I?
I'm ants at a picnic?
Is that what you just said?
I'm ants at a picnic?
all right.
Just making sure.
Sorry I'm late, fellas.
cool, Glenn.
You look just like Tommy Lee.
Well, I figured it'd be appropriate since I just found out I got hepatitis.
You know, maybe we should have decided on outfits that matched.
Now we all look like a bunch of queers.
Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear... as long as you play kickass rock and roll and do this with your tongue.

Great, I'll pick you up whenever I feel like it.

One, two, three, four...

I know what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here.

Hit it!
Cloudy skies and rain clouds Have come to stay
Windy nights and sad sights Won't go away

From the world famous Apollo Theater in Harlem... it's show time at the-
What?
I'm tired.
It has nothing to do with the fact that it's a black show.
What?
I can't be tired at 1:00 in the morning?
It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex on TV
But where are those good old-fashioned values
On which we used to rely?
Lucky there's a family guy
Lucky there's a man who Positively can do
All the things that make us
Laugh and cry
He's a family guy
There's Craig Hoffman.
He's such a rebel.
Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous.
And he plays by no one's rules but his own.
Meg, you should ask him out.
I mean, you're the only one of us who's ever had a real boyfriend.
I'm back.
I brought another picnic.
You're such a good listener.
You're not like the other boys.
You're so good with animals.
I guess I could give it a try.
All right, here goes.
Hi, Craig.
I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...
I don't know, go out sometime.
That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules besides my own... which I would never do.
I play by my own rules, nobody else's.
Not even my own.
- How about a movie?
- I don't go out with dudes.
- Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
- Of course not, sweetie.
Yeah, where'd you get a stupid idea like that?
- Craig Hoffman.
- Craig Hoffman said that?
Well, he's a sharp kid.
You might be ugly.
There, there, let me dry those tears.
Yes, your anguish sustains me.
Meg, honey, don't let those awful kids at school... make you feel bad about yourself.
I tell you what.
Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out and get you some brand new outfits.
Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans that'll show off your cute butt, huh?
Really?
Wow, thanks, Mom.
Meg in low-riders.
Enough of that.
Go away, damn you.
You're going to get it now.
Oh, my God!
Horace, what is this all about?
What the hell's it look like?
I'm putting the bar up for sale.
Please tell me this is some kind of practical joke.
Like the kind I used to play when I was an intern at the hospital.
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Your wife's gonna be a vegetable.
You'll have to bathe her, feed her and care for her the rest of her life.
Oh, my God.
No, I'm just kidding.
She's dead.
Ever since that mega-mall opened across the street... it's been taking away all my business.
They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants... 53 bars, and an indoor cattle ranch.
I go to Baskin-Robbins every night and buy myself a little treat.
Now, how in the hell am I supposed to compete with that?
You need to fix the place up.
Reinvent The Clam's image and we'll help you.
That'll take forever.
Not if we do a 1980s fixing-stuff-up montage.
Well, I think we made it worse.
Boy, I do not envy whoever has to clean that mess up.
Brian, why don't you take Stewie while Meg and I go clothes shopping?
You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around the mall at my height.
- I say, let me get on your back.
- Oh, for God's sake.
Strong with the force, young Skywalker is.
- God, I don't believe this.
- That is why you fail.
What about this, Meg?
A pink baby tee that says "Little Slut?"
- That seems pretty hip.
- I don't know if that's really me, Mom.
Well, they've got one that says "Porn Star"... and another that says "Sperm Dumpster" and they're all written in glitter.
All right.
All right.
Give me "Sperm Dumpster. "
That's the spirit.
- You finding everything okay?
- Yes, thank you.
- You just let me know if you need any...
- How do these jeans look?
- $10.
- $5.
- $8 and I'll do it.
- Fine.
Help, I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!
Help me!
I am so outrageous.
Give me the cash.
- Cold in here?
- Nope, just really small.
Face it, Mom.
No matter what I wear, I look ugly.
Meg, you're being...
That's...
Let's try down here.
Coming up next, Joan Rivers speaks to us from beyond the grave.
But first, let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall... where Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa... is handing out makeovers.
That's right, Tom.
Some lucky hideous woman will be transformed... by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society.
Meg, that's it.
You could get a makeover.
That'd be just the thing to boost your confidence.
Miss Takanawa!
Miss Takanawa!
Over here!
My daughter needs a makeover like there's no freaking tomorrow.
It looks like we've got a winner, Tom.
- Face it, The Clam is doomed.
- Come on, guys, we can't give up now.
Peter, we've tried every theme we could think of and everything's failed.
Especially that Coyote Ugly theme.
It's no use, this place is finished.
Quagmire, go get the "For Sale" sign.
Hey, Horace, what the hell's this?
It's a karaoke machine.
I never got around to installing it.
A karaoke machine?
Wait a minute, that's it.
We'll turn this place into a karaoke bar.
Oh, man, that's the best idea since they faked the moon landing.
Okay, cut.
Neil Armstrong.
Wait a minute.
You're supposed to be on the moon.
I just saw it on TV.
There's a... tape delay.
And solar winds...
Peter, take a look at your daughter.
Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry.
It was 20 years ago.
- I'd never even heard the word "rubber"...
- Peter, this is Meg.
Oh.
I got a makeover, Dad.
Don't I look great?
Meg, honey, I always thought you were beautiful just the way you...
God, couldn't do that with a straight face.
Welcome to the family, sweetheart.
Chris, go burn all Meg's old pictures.
There's got to be a morning after
We're moving closer to the shore
I know we'll be there by tomorrow
And we'll escape the darkness
We won't be searching anymore
Thank you very much.
I don't understand it.
This place should be jumping.
Well, we just need to kick it up a notch.
Horace, hit it.
Just a small town girl
Living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Peter, don't make me do...
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train
Going anywhere
Oh, God, I love this song.
And I love it when amateurs sing the lyrics.
But I hate baseball cards.
Some will win
Some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
The movie never ends
It goes on and on
Hey, that's Journey.
Kickass!
Howard!
That is Journey.
Streetlight people
Get some!
Get some!
Guys, we were freaking electric.
Yeah, they loved us.
Gentlemen, this is a sign.
We are gonna start our own rock band.
Who's with me?
I'm in.
Looks like the guys are gonna form a rock band.
Maybe they'll learn a little something.
Stick around, you just might learn something, too.
You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of drunken idiots... at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean you have what it takes to form a band.
Brian, you're just ants at a picnic.
We're gonna be awesome.
Wait.
What am I?
I'm ants at a picnic?
Is that what you just said?
I'm ants at a picnic?
All right.
Just making sure.
Sorry I'm late, fellas.
Cool, Glenn.
You look just like Tommy Lee.
Well, I figured it'd be appropriate since I just found out I got hepatitis.
You know, maybe we should have decided on outfits that matched.
Now we all look like a bunch of queers.
Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear... as long as you play kickass rock and roll and do this with your tongue.
- Am I right, Gene?
- You got that right, Pete.
Oh, my.
Hi, Gene.
I didn't know you were here.
All right.
Keep it in your mouth, rock star.
- Great job getting hot, Meg.
- Gee, thanks.
- Hey, Meg.
- Hi, Craig.
Now that you're attractive, how about we go out sometime?
Gosh, I'd love to.
Great, I'll pick you up whenever I feel like it.
Hey, Meg.
We noticed Craig Hoffman just asked you out.
That makes you cool.
Wanna hang out with us?
- Sure.
- Hey, I'm here to pick you up.
Here we are, fellas.
Our first major gig.
Peter, this is a house of corrections.
You gotta start somewhere, fellas.
That's how you evolve.
Like when the Tin Man found out he was gay.
Look what happened by accident.
I hear there's a lot of buzz about this band.
Yeah, there was a pretty positive review carved in Tony's ass.
All right, kids.
Now everyone stay together.
It's very important to your father... that we're here for his band's first performance.
The people who beat you are proud to present, all the way from Quahog...
Fat, Horny, Black and Joe.
- Hello, Cleveland!
- Hello, Peter.
One, two, three, four...
Oh, my God, we don't know any songs.
- You suck!
- Get off the stage!
What do we do?
I know what I'm doing.
I'm getting out of here.
How about a funny story about Lake Wobegone?
It was the day of the tuna hot-dish jamboree...
Oh, no.
Kids, your father's in trouble.
- I'm going up there.
- I'm coming, too, Mom.
Oh, my God.
The guy behind me braided my hair.
Chris, grab a guitar.
Brian, take the drums.
Here, Stewie, play with this.
Mom, can we please just get out of here?
- Oh, my God.
- Who is she?
God, I could strangle her all night long.
Boy, that's not healthy, is it?
That that's the first place I go to?
Hit it!
Cloudy skies and rain clouds Have come to stay
Windy nights and sad sights Won't go away
But I wanna be without a care
Unicorns and butterflies everywhere
Gonna buy me a rainbow
Gonna wrap it up in a great big bow
The time is right It's day, not night
Just open up your heart It'll be all right
Gonna buy me a rainbow
Buy me a rainbow
You guys were great.
My name's Jimmy Iovine.
And I'd like to make you filthy rich rock stars.
Wow, you're the chairman of Interscope Records.
- What're you doing in prison?
- I stomped a cat to death.
Listen, you guys got talent.
- Well, where do we sign?
- Right here, on Tony's butt cheek.
And initial here... and here.
And date.
Oh, crap.
Today's the seventeenth.
Gonna buy me a rainbow
Buy me a rainbow
- How was that, Dr. Ditty?
- Yo, that sounds smooth, y'all.
I just have a...
God, I'm so sorry.
I keep doing that.
God, please forgive me.
I get that from my father.
He's from a different generation.
- It's...
- Whatever, man.
- We cool?
We good?
- Yeah, we're cool.
Fine.
Mr. Doctor?
If you get shot in a rap feud... can you perform surgery on yourself?
Well, no, Chris.
My degree's in optometry.
All right, Dr. Ditty.
I got three choices for you for the name of the band:
Peter Griffin Starship, Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers... or Testicular Sound Express.
I think the name is Meg.
- Me?
Why?
- Yeah, why?
Let me explain something to you, all right?
We got to get her half-naked and put her out front, center stage.
And that's gonna make y'all billionaires... because America loves hot, white jailbait ass.
Wait a minute.
That's the smartest thing I've ever heard... anyone say about anything.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg being exploited that way.
Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision.
I want to be exploited.
Meg, don't you talk to me like that.
Look, Lois, I love Meal Ticket just as much as I love Chris and Stevie... but business is business.
So, let's get this show on the road, huh?
Good.
Now, I just need you to sign this.
Oh, God.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
That is not me.
That's not who I am.
I vote Democrat.
It will not happen again.
We cool?
We good?
You...
You guys know I have no problem with black people, right?
Yeah.
Sure.
You did say you hated Crooklyn.
- Hey, Doc, you got a minute?
- What you want, dog?
Yeah, so, hey, check it out.
Stewie and I have been working on some stuff of our own.
And we thought there might be a place for us to sing on the next album.
Hey, cool.
You're busy.
No sweat.
Boy, Benson was a funny show.
- I'll talk to you later.
- Well, what did he say?
He said he'd think about it.
Okay, so where were we?
Okay.
I want to have intercourse with you
Intercourse with you
Relations.
Intercourse with you
- Right?
- Yeah.
No, great, that sounds good.
All right, groovy.
Now, is there a shorter word for intercourse?
Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.
- Excuse me, young lady?
- Did I freaking stutter?
- I said more Skittles.
- All right.
That is it, Meg.
You know, ever since you got that makeover... you've developed a terrible attitude.
And all the success with the family band is only making it worse.
The family band?
You know, maybe you haven't noticed, Lois, but I am the band.
- Right, Missus Wong?
- Yeah, she band.
Old lady jealous.
Peter, we have to do something.
We're losing our daughter.
I'm worried about what's happening to her.
Lois, this is the kind of thing... that always resolves itself if you just ignore it, all right?
What's more important is we're living the sweet life.
This is even more fun than when I performed at the White House.
Mr. President, I present to you Peter Griffin.
Okay, listen up, everybody.
I got great news.
Meg, you and your family are gonna perform on Saturday Night Live.
You mean I'm gonna get to meet John Belushi and Gilda Radner... and Phil Hartman, and Chris Farley, and Horatio Sanz?
Sweet!
Saturday Night Live.
I can't think of anything more exciting.
Oh, my God, a water fountain!
Meg, I'm Jimmy Fallon.
It's great to finally meet you.
I'm hosting.
Why don't you come hang out in my dressing room?
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
Come on, let's go.
Peter, I'm worried about Meg.
She's spiraling out of control.
I mean, what if she develops a coke problem?
No Coke.
Pepsi.
Come on, you set me up for that one.
Wow, Jimmy.
That was everything Ladies Home Journal said it would be.
Awesome, great, thanks.
You know, there's something I...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Being with you just made me feel so...
Live from New York... it's Saturday Night!
It's Saturday Night Live.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, that wasn't a very good opening sketch, was it?
- A rare miss.
- I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.
Mom, Dad, he used me for comedy.
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me that my daughter was deflowered... in front of one-and-a-half times the Mad TVaudience?
My poor baby.
My God, Lois, you were right.
Why the hell didn't I see it coming?
All right, stand aside.
It's about time I did my fatherly duty.
I said "duty," but no time to laugh about it now.
Hey, everybody, it's great to be back.
So we got a great show tonight and...
Hey, Fallon, say goodnight, you bum.
And this is for laughing and looking at the camera... during every sketch you've ever been in.
Who do you think you are?
Carol Burnett?
You think because she did it, it's okay for you?
You haven't earned what she's earned, buddy.
All right, now where's the guy who slept with my daughter?
I'm so glad to be the real me again.
It's too much work being beautiful.
Not for me, but it's good to have you back, pumpkin.
Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do.
Listen, thanks, everybody.
I had a great time tonight.
I want to thank Jimmy Fallon for being such a good sport.
Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris, the guys from the prison...
Counting Crows.
If I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry.
Goodnight, everybody!
Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!
From the world famous Apollo Theater in Harlem... it's show time at the...
What?
I'm tired.
It has nothing to do with the fact that it's a black show.
What?
I can't be tired at 1:00 in the morning?
resync by margjakob
That is the lady you saw, is it?
Who wanted to know about Nemo, the law-writer?
And gave you a sovereign?
Yes, sir.
Take off your glove.
Well?
What about that?
I don't know, sir.
She had rings but she could have took 'em off since.
And do you remember the lady's voice?
Was it like this?
No.
The veil.
It's not her.
Not a bit like.
I'm sorry, sir, it's not my fault.
Nobody said it was, Jo.
Did they, Inspector?
Here, take this.
Take care how you spend it and don't get yourself into trouble.
Off with you now.
Are you satisfied, monsieur?
Yes, thank you, mademoiselle.
I will give you no further trouble about this little wager.
You will remember, sir, that I am not at present employed.
Certainly.
You will confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?
By all means.
A word from Mr Tulkinghorn is so powerful.
Goodnight, gentlemen.
All squared then, Mr Tulkinghorn.
There ain't a doubt.
It was the mistress with the maid's dress on.
All right, Mr Bucket.
Thank you, Mr Snagsby, for your help.
And for your discretion.
Yes, yes, indeed, Mr Tulkinghorn.
I'll see you on your way, sir.
Goodnight then, Officer.
And you will be discreet, Mr Snagsby, won't you?
Won't speak to anyone, anyone at all, of what you've seen and heard tonight?
Not a word, Inspector.
Oh, one more thing.
Are you familiar with a man called Gridley, Mr Snagsby?
The man from Shropshire?
Yes, yes.
for slandering Mr Tulkinghorn.
He's been keeping out me way.
If you was to see him or hear of where he was hiding himself, you'd let me know, I'm sure.
Certainly, certainly.
But upon my honour,
I haven't the least idea of where he might be.
All right, Mr Snagsby.
I'll let you go now.
Goodnight to you.
Goodnight, Inspector.
Richard, we shouldn't.
Who's to say that?
We promised Mr Jarndyce.
What?
Only to postpone our engagement.
He must be brought to change his mind about that and understand that we can't bear not to belong to each other utterly.
And I intend to tell him so myself.
And the rest.
There.
I've missed you so much.
Rick, this is a very pleasant surprise.
I trust Mr Kenge doesn't mind your taking a day or two of his time to visit us?
Ah...
Mr Kenge and I have come to an agreement.
What agreement's that?
That I'm not altogether suited to the law, sir.
Well, you mean you intend to abandon your studies?
Didn't we agree there could be no more changes of mind?
Yes, we did, but a man can make a mistake.
And if a mistake has been made, isn't it better to face up to it, admit one's been misled and choose a more suitable profession?
And what profession have you settled upon this time?
The army, sir.
I intend to purchase a commission in a good regiment.
Then, by living within my pay, I reckon I should be able to save up to £2, 000 in five years.
Enough to get married.
I've talked it all through with Ada.
Have you?
I believe the law is not the best profession for Richard, Mr Jarndyce.
That may well be.
Then we're agreed.
And Ada and I want you to recognise our engagement.
We're not children, we know our minds and our hearts.
I'm sure you think you do.
Let us leave that a moment.
It's a rare officer who lives within his pay, but let us leave that, too.
You must understand, Rick, this plan to go into the army must be your final choice.
Every penny that you have of certainty, and more, will be spent by the time you've equipped yourself.
Of course, it's quite true that I've exhausted my present resources.
I haven't laid my money out very wisely, perhaps, but I can admit my mistakes and learn from them.
I think it's hard of you to remind me of my errors in front of others.
I must be sure you understand the situation.
Are you quite sure you understand MY situation?
Every penny I have of certainty has been laid out but what I have of certainty is not all I have.
Rick.
Rick, for the love of God, don't found your hope on that wretched court case!
Better to borrow, better to beg...
better to die!
I know these are strong words, Ada, but I have seen how that case destroys men's lives.
How it drove my great uncle to blow out his own brains.
Now, as to your proposed engagement, when we spoke of it before, I advised you that you were too young to make such a commitment.
What has happened since then has strengthened me in that view.
It will be better for both of you if you remain cousins for the foreseeable future.
Why don't you just say you have no confidence in me and advise Ada not to have any either!
Because I don't mean that.
But you think I've begun badly!
Rick, you've hardly begun at all.
When you've something to offer Ada, that'll be the time to think of an engagement.
You're very hard with us, sir.
Well...
.you have the remedy in your own hands.
Come, Rick, you know it's time to knuckle down and make something of yourself.
Let's shake hands on it.
Mr Krook?
It is not convenient.
I am in deshabille.
Please go away.
Whatever it is will wait until morning.
Mr...
MrKrook,I...
Mr Gridley!
A thousand apologies, Miss Flite.
I didn't know where else to go.
They've done for me.
That monster Tulkinghorn's got a warrant on me for slander.
I spent last night at Tom All Alone's.
Mr Gridley, dear old friend, much as I sympathise,
I couldn't offer you shelter here.
Please understand, Mr Gridley, it wouldn't be proper.
I...
I'm an unmarried lady.
Of course.
Quite right.
Thousand apologies.
I couldn't think of anyone else.
General George!
General George, Mr Gridley.
He will help you.
He has accommodation of a rough sort and a heart of gold.
The flowers in the drawing room are looking rather tired.
I'll see to it at once, m'Lady.
Oh, Mrs Rouncewell?
Yes, m'Lady.
What do you know of that girl in Mr Jarndyce's care?
Miss Clare, m'Lady?
The ward in Jarndyce?
No, the other.
Her companion.
Summerbee...
Summerfield.
Miss Summerson, begging your pardon, m'Lady.
Well?
No-one knows anything about her in the village.
Except she seemed a very pleasant young lady.
No airs and graces.
But where she comes from, nobody knows, as they say.
All right, Mrs Rouncewell.
And come again, Mr Carstone, sir.
Steady.
Watch the eyes, not the blade.
Watch the eyes, not the blade.
And come again, sir.
Hold hard, Mr Carstone, sir.
Let's not run before we can walk.
Yes.
All right.
Thank you, Mr George.
And come again.
I have to go now.
Court, you know.
Thank you, Mr George.
Good day to you.
See you this afternoon, sir?
He ain't a stayer, that one, Mr George.
He may be yet, Phil.
In too much of a hurry.
Oh, what's that?
There, that's for the Chancellor.
And that's for Tulkinghorn.
Hang on, Mr G. I don't think you're up to this work, not just now.
You come along with Phil.
Thank you, Phil.
Yes?
The man called Nemo, Mr Tulkinghorn.
I've been sniffing around like you asked.
He pawned some medals the day he died.
And?
One of them was inscribed with the name of Captain Hawdon.
Do we know of him, Clamb?
Smallweed, the moneylender, had been advertising a little while ago for the whereabouts of Captain Hawdon.
Seems the gentleman had defaulted on his debts and gone missing.
I wonder if Smallweed had any success in finding him?
Perhaps we should have a word with Mr Smallweed.
Very good, Mr Tulkinghorn.
Don't you know me, Miss?
It's Charley.
Charley Neckett.
Oh, yes, of course.
And what can we do for you, Charley?
If you please, Miss, I'm to be your maid.
I'm a present to you from Mr Jarndyce.
No, don't embarrass me with thanks.
I saw how things were and how they could be and it gave me pleasure to arrange it all.
I wish you had consulted me first.
You don't think she's suitable?
I'm sure she'll do very well.
But is it kind to separate her from her brother and sister?
And what am I to do with a lady's maid?
Maids are for the likes of Lady Dedlock, not the likes of me.
I never asked for a lady's maid, and nor would I feel myself comfortable with one.
Esther, in my mind at least, you're quite as much of a lady as my Lady Dedlock.
And perhaps it's time for you to begin to think of yourself as such.
Look, will you keep Charley on?
Just to humour me?
And if I can arrange it so that she can see Tom and Emma more than once a month...
You wouldn't send her away now, would you?
No.
You must think me very ungrateful.
And believe me, I'm not.
But your kindness is almost...
.overwhelming.
Forgive me?
If you're round me, you'll know it.
Have a care there, you maniac!
I'll have your throats cut, I will!
Oh, my Lord, I'm shaken.
In here!
Go on, get in there!
Oh, you clumsy oaf!
You'll put me in me grave!
Mr Smallweed, good of you to trouble yourself.
Honoured, Mr Tulkinghorn.
Privileged, deeply gratified.
Set me down gently.
Gently!
Off!
Off, out.
Go on, wait outside.
Savages.
I'm half killed.
If you'd be so kind as to ask your man to shake me up a bit, Mr Tulkinghorn?
Oh...
Much obliged.
Deeply honoured.
Very nice.
Very smart.
Now, how can I be of service?
Some time ago you were interested in tracing a Captain Hawdon.
Hawdon?
Yes, I was.
A welsher.
A bilker.
A defalcator.
Owes me hundreds of pounds and gone to ground.
Bad debt!
Bad debt!
I hate 'em !
You didn't find him then?
He'd know about it if I did.
I'd squeeze him.
Did anybody come in answer to your advertisement?
Only one, and he was no good to me.
His old sergeant from his army days, Mr George.
He owes me money too, but he pays the interest.
But he clammed up when he heard what the matter was.
This Sergeant George...
close companion of Captain Hawdon, would you say?
I would.
Close as blood, I'd say.
But he wouldn't give him up, no matter what.
Mr Smallweed, I believe you can do me a service.
You know where Sergeant George is to be found?
I do.
Oh, mind my bones, you brimstone black people!
Smash me to pieces, will ya!
'Ere!
Oh, give 'em tuppence, Judy, it's more than they're worth.
I think this has killed me.
Mr George!
Mr George, over here!
Mr Smallweed.
Oh, dear.
That sword looks awful gleaming and sharp.
It might cut someone, by accident.
We don't go in for accidents here, Mr Smallweed.
And if you could tell your workman not to wave his firearm so...
Oh, Lord.
It's me granddaughter, Judy.
Shake me up, Judy.
Nice little business you got here, Mr George.
Worth a bit, I'd say.
Come to turn me out of it, have you?
No, not yet, George.
Not unless my friend in the city insists on it.
You're a bit behind on your payments.
Oh, dear, quite a bit behind.
Never was much of a money man, was you, Mr George?
Oh, yes, reminds me.
Young gentleman who comes here, name of Carstone,
I was thinking of buying some of his debts cheap.
What do you think?
They say he has good friends and a chance in a lawsuit.
Might be worth a flutter, at a price, you know.
But to pass from the ensign to the captain, I've come to do you a favour, George.
You remember Captain Hawdon, your gallant comrade in arms?
You remember I advertised, you came to me?
You tricked me.
You said he would hear something to his advantage.
But you were pursuing him for debts.
And why should I not?
I bought 'em up thinking he was an honourable man with friends to rally round.
He turned into a scoundrel and a blackguard, a gyper and a sneak!
You won't speak of him like that.
Not here.
He was a gallant officer, and the best friend a man ever had.
And bloodsuckers like you feasted on him when he was down.
Oh, Judy, he's killing me.
You won't speak of him like that.
And you won't find him either.
He's dead.
Oh, dear.
Shake me up, Judy.
There's a lawyer, a very eminent lawyer, wants a sample of his handwriting.
He'll pay.
He'll pay well.
Enough to end all your troubles, I dare say.
So if you happen to have any letters in his hand, my dear old friend...
I wouldn't give you the sight of 'em.
I wouldn't want it!
It's for my friend, the eminent lawyer.
He's keen.
He's keen as mustard for 'em.
He's got enough to end all your money troubles, George.
And if the Captain's dead, where's the 'arm in it?
If you're in it, there's bound to be harm in it.
Not a bit of it, my dear old friend.
Stands to reason I'd like to see you straight.
Will you see the gentleman, George?
I'll think about it.
What's his name?
Tulkinghorn.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
Application for costs.
Yes, very well, very well.
Mr Tangle.
Always costs, costs, costs, and nothing is done.
Patience, dear friend.
We shall all be served on the Day of Judgement.
Miss Flite.
Good to see you in court, Mr Carstone, but there really is no need for you to trouble yourself.
How else am I to find out about my affairs?
It seems to me that you lawyers conspire to prolong proceedings week after week and no progress is made.
It would seem so to the untutored eye, indeed, but I can assure you...
You forget that I have studied law, sir.
Oh, yes.
Several weeks.
And now we are to congratulate you on your commission in the army.
I trust you'll find it more...
in your line.
Mr Jarndyce is coming up to town, I believe?
Yes, he is, sir.
To satisfy himself I'm keeping my nose to Mr George's grindstone.
And the other ward in Jarndyce, Miss Clare, and her companion Miss Summerson?
Yes, yes, they're coming too.
Oh!
My very best respects to them.
And to you, Mr Carstone.
Good day.
Very well, Mr Tangle, the court decrees...
I suppose it's nothing to him if the case goes on forever.
I beg your pardon, Mr Carstone, but did I hear you mention Mr George?
Yes, Miss Flite.
What of it?
An old friend of mine is lodging there, incognito, and I should like to visit him, but it's not a neighbourhood I like to go to on my own.
My dear Miss Flite, it will be my pleasure to escort you there whenever you wish.
Oh, Mr Carstone.
I'm so obliged.
And as such must be paid by the plaintiff, and...
The Turveydrop Academy of Dance and Deportment, Cross Street, driver.
Sir.
We'll meet you at Mr George's shooting gallery.
You have the address?
Yes.
Give Caddy my very best wishes, Esther.
I will.
Bye, my dear.
Walk on.
It's so good of you to come, Miss.
I'm very glad to see you both.
He's in such a state.
He swore he couldn't do it, and I said he must, and then he said,
"Well, if Miss Summerson was standing by, I think I might bring it off. "
And so, today's the day.
Caddy, If you think I would be of help...
Prince does.
Then I'm very happy to.
Oh, Lord, here he comes.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Father, you remember Miss Summerson?
Charmed.
Enchanted.
Overjoyed.
Our little academy is made a paradise.
My dear son, you have four schools this afternoon.
I recommend a hasty sandwich.
Father...
I beg you prepare your mind for what I have to say.
Good heaven.
What is this?
Father,
I love this young lady, and we are engaged.
Engaged?
!
An arrow launched at my brow by my own child.
It is well your sainted mother is spared this pang.
Strike home, sir, strike home.
Dear Father, don't say that.
Caddy and I don't forget our duty.
You will always be the head and master here.
Strike home.
Strike home.
You will have everything you had and more, Father.
You will have two to care for you instead of one.
And we shall devote ourselves to making your life agreeable.
Won't we, Caddy?
Yes, Prince.
Father?
My son, my children,
I cannot resist your prayer.
Be happy.
And what did Mr and Mrs Jellyby have to say?
I don't think Ma hardly noticed.
She'd only care about me if I was an African.
Pa's bankrupt and the bailiffs are in.
She don't care about that.
It'll be such a relief to be out of that house and with my darling Prince, even if we do have to put up with his Pa.
He's in court, you say?
Yes, sir.
I believe he looks in there most days.
I think I feel a touch of the east wind, Ada.
And what kind of a swordsman d'you make of Mr Carstone?
Pretty good, sir.
If Mr Carstone were to give his full mind to it, he would be very good.
Ah, here's the man of the moment.
Rick, my boy.
We've come to see how you're getting on.
That's very kind of you sir, I'm sure.
Cousin Ada.
And what have you found out, sir?
How am I getting on?
Oh, pretty well, according to Mr George.
I'm relieved to hear it.
I'm due to join my regiment next week to sail for Ireland.
Mr George.
I've come to visit a dear old friend of mine who you've been looking after.
We need not speak his name, a Chancery friend...
Mr George...
Sayshe 'sadoctor.
Called to see you know who.
Ah, very good.
Doctor?
You're no doctor.
I know you.
You do, George.
And I know you as well.
My name is Bucket, for those who ain't aware of it.
And I've got a peace-warrant against a man named Gridley.
For slandering Mr Tulkinghorn.
Oh, dear.
And what makes you think he's here?
Been keeping an eye on his old friend Miss Flite, in case she got the urge to pay him a call.
You kept him out the way a long time, George, and it does you credit.
But the game's up now.
You're a man of sense, you know, and you'll give him up quietly.
This way, then.
May we see our dear old friend first?
Oh...
Well, you see...
here I am.
This is what it's come to.
I thought they'd never wear me out.
I thought they'd never break my heart, but they have.
Come, come, Gridley.
That's not your way.
We're all a little low now and then.
Hold up.
You'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em again and again, you're not done yet.
Don't shake your head, nod it.
Look.
Here's Tulkinghorn's warrant.
Wouldn't you like to tear it with your teeth, him too?
Let's have it out with him before the magistrates, eh?
I made a fight of it, once upon a time.
But it's all done now.
All done?
Never.
You're half the fun of the fair at Chancery, you are.
George, you lend him a hand, let's see if he won't be better up than down.
Come on, Mr Gridley.
No!
Mr Gridley...
Not without my blessing.
Not... notwithoutmyblessing.
resync by margjakob
That is the lady you saw, is it?
Who wanted to know about Nemo, the law-writer?
And gave you a sovereign?
Yes, sir.
Take off your glove.
Well?
What about that?
I don't know, sir.
She had rings but she could have took 'em off since.
And do you remember the lady's voice?
FRENCH ACCENT:
Was it like this?
No.
The veil.
It's not her.
Not a bit like.
I'm sorry, sir, it's not my fault.
Nobody said it was, Jo.
Did they, Inspector?
Here, take this.
Take care how you spend it and don't get yourself into trouble.
Off with you now.
Are you satisfied, monsieur?
Yes, thank you, mademoiselle.
I will give you no further trouble about this little wager.
You will remember, sir, that I am not at present employed.
Certainly.
You will confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation?
By all means.
A word from Mr Tulkinghorn is so powerful.
Goodnight, gentlemen.
All squared then, Mr Tulkinghorn.
There ain't a doubt.
It was the mistress with the maid's dress on.
All right, Mr Bucket.
Thank you, Mr Snagsby, for your help.
And for your discretion.
Yes, yes, indeed, Mr Tulkinghorn.
I'll see you on your way, sir.
Goodnight then, Officer.
And you will be discreet, Mr Snagsby, won't you?
Won't speak to anyone, anyone at all, of what you've seen and heard tonight?
Not a word, Inspector.
Oh, one more thing.
Are you familiar with a man called Gridley, Mr Snagsby?
The man from Shropshire?
Yes, yes.
for slandering Mr Tulkinghorn.
He's been keeping out me way.
If you was to see him or hear of where he was hiding himself, you'd let me know, I'm sure.
Certainly, certainly.
But upon my honour,
I haven't the least idea of where he might be.
All right, Mr Snagsby.
I'll let you go now.
Goodnight to you.
Goodnight, Inspector.
Richard, we shouldn't.
Who's to say that?
We promised Mr Jarndyce.
What?
Only to postpone our engagement.
He must be brought to change his mind about that and understand that we can't bear not to belong to each other utterly.
And I intend to tell him so myself.
And the rest.
There.
I've missed you so much.
GIGGLING AND CHATTER
Rick, this is a very pleasant surprise.
I trust Mr Kenge doesn't mind your taking a day or two of his time to visit us?
Ah...
Mr Kenge and I have come to an agreement.
What agreement's that?
That I'm not altogether suited to the law, sir.
Well, you mean you intend to abandon your studies?
Didn't we agree there could be no more changes of mind?
Yes, we did, but a man can make a mistake.
And if a mistake has been made, isn't it better to face up to it, admit one's been misled and choose a more suitable profession?
And what profession have you settled upon this time?
The army, sir.
I intend to purchase a commission in a good regiment.
Then, by living within my pay, I reckon I should be able to save up to £2, 000 in five years.
Enough to get married.
I've talked it all through with Ada.
Have you?
I believe the law is not the best profession for Richard, Mr Jarndyce.
That may well be.
Then we're agreed.
And Ada and I want you to recognise our engagement.
We're not children, we know our minds and our hearts.
I'm sure you think you do.
Let us leave that a moment.
It's a rare officer who lives within his pay, but let us leave that, too.
You must understand, Rick, this plan to go into the army must be your final choice.
Every penny that you have of certainty, and more, will be spent by the time you've equipped yourself.
Of course, it's quite true that I've exhausted my present resources.
I haven't laid my money out very wisely, perhaps, but I can admit my mistakes and learn from them.
I think it's hard of you to remind me of my errors in front of others.
I must be sure you understand the situation.
Are you quite sure you understand MY situation?
Every penny I have of certainty has been laid out but what I have of certainty is not all I have.
Rick.
Rick, for the love of God, don't found your hope on that wretched court case!
Better to borrow, better to beg...
better to die!
I know these are strong words, Ada, but I have seen how that case destroys men's lives.
How it drove my great uncle to blow out his own brains.
Now, as to your proposed engagement, when we spoke of it before, I advised you that you were too young to make such a commitment.
What has happened since then has strengthened me in that view.
It will be better for both of you if you remain cousins for the foreseeable future.
Why don't you just say you have no confidence in me and advise Ada not to have any either!
Because I don't mean that.
But you think I've begun badly!
Rick, you've hardly begun at all.
When you've something to offer Ada, that'll be the time to think of an engagement.
You're very hard with us, sir.
Well...
.you have the remedy in your own hands.
Come, Rick, you know it's time to knuckle down and make something of yourself.
Let's shake hands on it.
DOOR SLAMS
KNOCK ON DOOR
Mr Krook?
It is not convenient.
I am in deshabille.
Please go away.
Whatever it is will wait until morning.
Mr...
MrKrook,I...
Mr Gridley!
A thousand apologies, Miss Flite.
I didn't know where else to go.
They've done for me.
That monster Tulkinghorn's got a warrant on me for slander.
HE COUGHS
I spent last night at Tom All Alone's.
Mr Gridley, dear old friend, much as I sympathise,
I couldn't offer you shelter here.
Please understand, Mr Gridley, it wouldn't be proper.
I...
I'm an unmarried lady.
Of course.
Quite right.
Thousand apologies.
I couldn't think of anyone else.
General George!
General George, Mr Gridley.
He will help you.
He has accommodation of a rough sort and a heart of gold.
The flowers in the drawing room are looking rather tired.
I'll see to it at once, m'Lady.
Oh, Mrs Rouncewell?
Yes, m'Lady.
What do you know of that girl in Mr Jarndyce's care?
Miss Clare, m'Lady?
The ward in Jarndyce?
No, the other.
Her companion.
Summerbee...
Summerfield.
Miss Summerson, begging your pardon, m'Lady.
Well?
No-one knows anything about her in the village.
Except she seemed a very pleasant young lady.
No airs and graces.
But where she comes from, nobody knows, as they say.
All right, Mrs Rouncewell.
MR GEORGE:
And come again, Mr Carstone, sir.
Steady.
Watch the eyes, not the blade.
Watch the eyes, not the blade.
And come again, sir.
Hold hard, Mr Carstone, sir.
Let's not run before we can walk.
Yes.
All right.
Thank you, Mr George.
And come again.
I have to go now.
Court, you know.
Thank you, Mr George.
Good day to you.
See you this afternoon, sir?
He ain't a stayer, that one, Mr George.
He may be yet, Phil.
In too much of a hurry.
Oh, what's that?
GUNSHOT There, that's for the Chancellor.
And that's for Tulkinghorn.
Hang on, Mr G. I don't think you're up to this work, not just now.
You come along with Phil.
Thank you, Phil.
Yes?
The man called Nemo, Mr Tulkinghorn.
I've been sniffing around like you asked.
He pawned some medals the day he died.
And?
One of them was inscribed with the name of Captain Hawdon.
Do we know of him, Clamb?
Smallweed, the moneylender, had been advertising a little while ago for the whereabouts of Captain Hawdon.
Seems the gentleman had defaulted on his debts and gone missing.
I wonder if Smallweed had any success in finding him?
Perhaps we should have a word with Mr Smallweed.
Very good, Mr Tulkinghorn.
Don't you know me, Miss?
It's Charley.
Charley Neckett.
Oh, yes, of course.
And what can we do for you, Charley?
If you please, Miss, I'm to be your maid.
I'm a present to you from Mr Jarndyce.
No, don't embarrass me with thanks.
I saw how things were and how they could be and it gave me pleasure to arrange it all.
I wish you had consulted me first.
You don't think she's suitable?
I'm sure she'll do very well.
But is it kind to separate her from her brother and sister?
And what am I to do with a lady's maid?
Maids are for the likes of Lady Dedlock, not the likes of me.
I never asked for a lady's maid, and nor would I feel myself comfortable with one.
Esther, in my mind at least, you're quite as much of a lady as my Lady Dedlock.
And perhaps it's time for you to begin to think of yourself as such.
Look, will you keep Charley on?
Just to humour me?
And if I can arrange it so that she can see Tom and Emma more than once a month...
You wouldn't send her away now, would you?
No.
You must think me very ungrateful.
And believe me, I'm not.
But your kindness is almost...
.overwhelming.
Forgive me?
MR SMALLWEED:
If you're round me, you'll know it.
Have a care there, you maniac!
I'll have your throats cut, I will!
Oh, my Lord, I'm shaken.
In here!
Go on, get in there!
Oh, you clumsy oaf!
You'll put me in me grave!
Mr Smallweed, good of you to trouble yourself.
Honoured, Mr Tulkinghorn.
Privileged, deeply gratified.
Set me down gently.
Gently!
Off!
Off, out.
Go on, wait outside.
Savages.
I'm half killed.
If you'd be so kind as to ask your man to shake me up a bit, Mr Tulkinghorn?
BONES CRACK Oh...
Much obliged.
Deeply honoured.
Very nice.
Very smart.
Now, how can I be of service?
Some time ago you were interested in tracing a Captain Hawdon.
Hawdon?
Yes, I was.
A welsher.
A bilker.
A defalcator.
Owes me hundreds of pounds and gone to ground.
Bad debt!
Bad debt!
I hate 'em !
You didn't find him then?
He'd know about it if I did.
I'd squeeze him.
Did anybody come in answer to your advertisement?
Only one, and he was no good to me.
His old sergeant from his army days, Mr George.
He owes me money too, but he pays the interest.
But he clammed up when he heard what the matter was.
This Sergeant George...
close companion of Captain Hawdon, would you say?
I would.
Close as blood, I'd say.
But he wouldn't give him up, no matter what.
Mr Smallweed, I believe you can do me a service.
You know where Sergeant George is to be found?
I do.
Oh, mind my bones, you brimstone black people!
Smash me to pieces, will ya!
'Ere!
Oh, give 'em tuppence, Judy, it's more than they're worth.
I think this has killed me.
Mr George!
Mr George, over here!
Mr Smallweed.
Oh, dear.
That sword looks awful gleaming and sharp.
It might cut someone, by accident.
We don't go in for accidents here, Mr Smallweed.
And if you could tell your workman not to wave his firearm so...
Oh, Lord.
It's me granddaughter, Judy.
Shake me up, Judy.
Nice little business you got here, Mr George.
Worth a bit, I'd say.
Come to turn me out of it, have you?
No, not yet, George.
Not unless my friend in the city insists on it.
You're a bit behind on your payments.
HE CHUCKLES
Oh, dear, quite a bit behind.
Never was much of a money man, was you, Mr George?
Oh, yes, reminds me.
Young gentleman who comes here, name of Carstone,
I was thinking of buying some of his debts cheap.
What do you think?
They say he has good friends and a chance in a lawsuit.
Might be worth a flutter, at a price, you know.
But to pass from the ensign to the captain, I've come to do you a favour, George.
You remember Captain Hawdon, your gallant comrade in arms?
You remember I advertised, you came to me?
You tricked me.
You said he would hear something to his advantage.
But you were pursuing him for debts.
And why should I not?
I bought 'em up thinking he was an honourable man with friends to rally round.
He turned into a scoundrel and a blackguard, a gyper and a sneak!
You won't speak of him like that.
Not here.
He was a gallant officer, and the best friend a man ever had.
And bloodsuckers like you feasted on him when he was down.
Oh, Judy, he's killing me.
You won't speak of him like that.
And you won't find him either.
He's dead.
Oh, dear.
Shake me up, Judy.
There's a lawyer, a very eminent lawyer, wants a sample of his handwriting.
He'll pay.
He'll pay well.
Enough to end all your troubles, I dare say.
So if you happen to have any letters in his hand, my dear old friend...
I wouldn't give you the sight of 'em.
I wouldn't want it!
It's for my friend, the eminent lawyer.
He's keen.
He's keen as mustard for 'em.
He's got enough to end all your money troubles, George.
And if the Captain's dead, where's the 'arm in it?
If you're in it, there's bound to be harm in it.
Not a bit of it, my dear old friend.
Stands to reason I'd like to see you straight.
Will you see the gentleman, George?
I'll think about it.
What's his name?
Tulkinghorn.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce.
Application for costs.
Yes, very well, very well.
Mr Tangle.
Always costs, costs, costs, and nothing is done.
Patience, dear friend.
We shall all be served on the Day of Judgement.
Miss Flite.
Good to see you in court, Mr Carstone, but there really is no need for you to trouble yourself.

Yes, yes, they're coming too.
Oh!
My very best respects to them.
And to you, Mr Carstone.
Good day.
Very well, Mr Tangle, the court decrees...
I suppose it's nothing to him if the case goes on forever.
I beg your pardon, Mr Carstone, but did I hear you mention Mr George?
Yes, Miss Flite.
What of it?
An old friend of mine is lodging there, incognito, and I should like to visit him, but it's not a neighbourhood I like to go to on my own.
My dear Miss Flite, it will be my pleasure to escort you there whenever you wish.

I'm so obliged.
And as such must be paid by the plaintiff, and...
The Turveydrop Academy of Dance and Deportment, Cross Street, driver.
Sir.
We'll meet you at Mr George's shooting gallery.
You have the address?
Yes.
Give Caddy my very best wishes, Esther.
I will.
Bye, my dear.
Walk on.
It's so good of you to come, Miss.
I'm very glad to see you both.
He's in such a state.
He swore he couldn't do it, and I said he must, and then he said,
"Well, if Miss Summerson was standing by, I think I might bring it off. "
And so, today's the day.
Caddy, If you think I would be of help...
Prince does.
Then I'm very happy to.
Oh, Lord, here he comes.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Father, you remember Miss Summerson?
Charmed.
Enchanted.
Overjoyed.
Our little academy is made a paradise.
My dear son, you have four schools this afternoon.
I recommend a hasty sandwich.
Father...
I beg you prepare your mind for what I have to say.
Good heaven.
What is this?
Father,
I love this young lady, and we are engaged.
Engaged?
!
An arrow launched at my brow by my own child.
It is well your sainted mother is spared this pang.
Strike home, sir, strike home.
Dear Father, don't say that.
Caddy and I don't forget our duty.
You will always be the head and master here.
Strike home.
Strike home.
You will have everything you had and more, Father.
You will have two to care for you instead of one.
And we shall devote ourselves to making your life agreeable.
Won't we, Caddy?
Yes, Prince.
Father?
My son, my children,
I cannot resist your prayer.
Be happy.

Ah, here's the man of the moment.
Rick, my boy.
We've come to see how you're getting on.
That's very kind of you sir, I'm sure.
Cousin Ada.
And what have you found out, sir?
How am I getting on?
Oh, pretty well, according to Mr George.
I'm relieved to hear it.
I'm due to join my regiment next week to sail for Ireland.
Mr George.
I've come to visit a dear old friend of mine who you've been looking after.
We need not speak his name, a Chancery friend...
Mr George...
Sayshe 'sadoctor.
Called to see you know who.
Ah, very good.
Doctor?
You're no doctor.
I know you.
You do, George.
And I know you as well.
My name is Bucket, for those who ain't aware of it.

You'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em again and again, you're not done yet.
Don't shake your head, nod it.

Where are you living?
At home.
At my mother's.
Maybe I will drop by, so we can have a chat?
You have a great mom!
I know.
That is all.
- Leave him alone.
- What the fuck?
We're buddies.
Can't even chat with a buddy?
I can't pay you today, maybe you want a kitten instead?
Why would I need a kitten?
Buy a can of "Harpun" fish, mail in the label and win
- a family car...
- Damn it... damn it!
Don't call in, don't buy fish in a can... don't mail anything in.
You'll win your own self!
You'll definitely win.

Look how it works.
Crackles a little...

Who are you going to be?
Me?
An old maid...

You are joking.
I have a surprise for you.

- You should have taken them.
That's life, my friend.
Who needed them...
Nobody needs me either...
Why don't you drown me!
Here's your cash, don't get upset.
You'll come back!
You just try!

Go get him... get him!
You traitor!
Please come...
- Well, should we go?

Get him, let's get that Mongrel!
Guys, he's not here!

We can untie that rope and run away... far away.
The water will carry us away... lt will be fun... you'll see!
You'll see...
We will go far away from here...
Would you run away without me?
If you don't want to, fine, whatever.
I thought you would be happy.
Are you mad at me?
Do whatever you want.
Why should I be mad...
No means no.
You don't like me anymore?
Go, if you have to...
Why are you here?
You want to bite me again, don't you?
A hole...

I don't like myself...
You're not so bad.
So kiss me.
All right, but not on the lips.
What's the point, if not on the lips...
It feels very nice... ldiot.
ln movies they always kiss on the lips and they look very happy.
- I don't want to kiss on the lips.
- I knew it...
You're in love with my sister.
A marble.
- You want it?
- Uh-huh.
I knew nobody would ever kiss me.
I will never come here again
Batteries.
Here...
The other one, too...
Fancy shoes...
Really fancy...
How is it going, gentlemen?
Are you finished with this?
Oh hello, Marian, hello...
Let me through...
What are you up to...
You rascal!
Hello...
Good bye, see you tomorrow.
Bye, take care.
Hey, Mongrel!
You shouldn't have bothered to come.
The old man has no cash today.
I'm getting it all...
Where are you living?
At home.
At my mother's.
Maybe I will drop by, so we can have a chat?
You have a great mom!
I know.
That is all.
- Leave him alone.
- What the fuck?
We're buddies.
Can't even chat with a buddy?
I can't pay you today, maybe you want a kitten instead?
Why would I need a kitten?
Buy a can of "Harpun" fish, mail in the label and win
- a family car...
- Damn it... damn it!
Don't call in, don't buy fish in a can... don't mail anything in.
You'll win your own self!
You'll definitely win.
- ls that you?
- Mhmm...
Come on...
It's nice and warm here...
Come...
Look how it works.
Crackles a little...
That's all right.
- Do you like music?
- Yeah...
I love it.
Poets like music.
I'm going to be a poet...
- Do you write poems?
- No, but my friend said that sometimes when I think a lot, I look like a real poet...
Who are you going to be?
Me?
An old maid...
An old maid?
You are joking.
I have a surprise for you.
Try it on.
Thank you...
Get in the car!
Come back here!
Young lady...
come back now... come back.
Come on, get in the car...
- Quickly now, get in the car!
- Hurry up!
Get in the car!
Where are the kittens?
- They went down...
- What do you mean?
ln the river...
You drowned them?
Who could have fed them all...
I would have taken them...
all of them...
- If only I had known...
- You should have taken them.
That's life, my friend.
Who needed them...
Nobody needs me either...
Why don't you drown me!
Here's your cash, don't get upset.
You'll come back!
You just try!
She won't come...
Come to me...
Come on...
This is for you...
Nice, isn't it?
Now count...
see how long I can hold it.
Quick...
Get out...
Hurry up...
Hurry!
Hurry!
What's going on here?
- What are you up to?
- I'm taking a bath!
You're back already?
I never left.
She's asleep...
Damn it, I overslept.
Go get him... get him!
You traitor!
Please come...
- Well, should we go?
- Let's go!
Get him, let's get that Mongrel!
Guys, he's not here!
Come on, the fucker isn't coming!
Let's get the fuck outta here!
Wait till I lay my hands on that dickhead!
We can untie that rope and run away... far away.
The water will carry us away...
It will be fun... you'll see!
You'll see...
We will go far away from here...
Would you run away without me?
If you don't want to, fine, whatever.
I thought you would be happy.
Are you mad at me?
Do whatever you want.
Why should I be mad...
No means no.
You don't like me anymore?
Go, if you have to...
Why are you here?
You want to bite me again, don't you?
A hole...
- Where did you get that?
- I just have it.
Why did you come here?
He was supposed to come...
But he's not here...
Why did you come here...
I never want to see you again, you hear me?
I never want to see you...
Hey...
don't want to talk to your pal?
- Have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.
- Bullshit.
- No!
- Smoke with a friend.
- I don't smoke.
- How about a punch in the face?
- No.
- Your pretty face asks for hitting.
- So hit me.
You'll get what's coming to you.
Hit me, you'll feel better...
- You've got a great mother...
- I know.
No you don't...
I'm fucking your mother...
You're lying!
Say it isn't true...
Hey!
What's going on down there?
I'm drying my clothes!
Just don't start a fire!
Hey, hey!
Wake up!
Hey!
What have you been doing?
Laundry?
No...
Come here...
lie down with me...
What happened?
What's wrong?
My mother doesn't like me...
What have I done...
You just are.
It wouldn't take much...
and I wouldn't be here anymore...
You wanted to run away?
I wanted to drown myself...
What?
Drown?
Because nobody loves me...
Don't do this to me...
Kidnap me.
Let's run away together.
Tomorrow we can run away together.
- You really want to?
- I do.
We'll run away.
We will get caught one day, won't we?
Are you scared?
No...
With you I'm not afraid of anyone...
It feels so good to be with you...
I LOVE YOU!
- Have you seen this boy?
- I maight.
- And?
- And what.
- You didn't find it peculiar?
- No, I didn't.
- Wasn't it strange that he lives there?
- People live in different places...
- But he's just a child...
- Hey, where are you off to!
Eh, some child!
What's your name?
First name?
Surname?
- What is your name?
- What does it matter?
Man... what are you doing in this world?
I am.
I have other responsibilities, a wife, my job.
I shouldn't have to worry about you...
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
Can I help you?
Hey, Dad.
I didn't wanna interrupt your phone conversation.
No, it's just somebody about a case I've been working on.
- What can I do for you?
- I've been thinking.
I've been putting in some long hours and some extra work, and I was wondering if I could have a raise.
Also, they raised my rent, and I've been kind of...
I've grown fond of living indoors.
I wish I could help you, Harrison but such a quick pay bump, and for my son.
- You understand how that would look.
- Yeah, I figured.
You can't blame a guy for trying, huh?
Right.
Okay, so you get eight days of Christmas?
Tyler, for the last time, it's called Hanukkah, all right?
If you call it Christmas one more time, I'm gonna shove a menorah up your...
Secret Santas.
We should open up our nondenominational gifts.
Great idea.
Um...
- Ave, you go first.
- Yes.
- Drum roll.
- I got a comb.
And I'm gonna guess that it's from Tyler.
Hey.
What happened to the secret part?
FYI, buddy, the "under 10 dollar" rule that's actually not a contest to see how far under 10 you can keep it.
I know these two are going home for vacation.
If they survive the ride to the airport together.
But what about you?
What are the Davies up to tonight?
Well, it looks like, as usual, my family Christmas Eve will consist of me my brother, Harry, and a toast to the rest of the family who couldn't make it.
Well, on the bright side, there's less cleanup.
- But more therapy.
- You know what?
Coal for you in your stocking.
That's all you'll get.
My people, we don't do the stockings.
None of that.
What is going on with you?
Normally you're all "bah humbug" and grinch-y.
This year, I'm all about the holiday spirit, the tree trimming, the church.
- Hell, I might even sit on Santa's lap.
- Lucky Santa.
Lucky me.
You know, I mean, I shouldn't even be here.
But you saved me.
And I know it sounds dumb, but every day is a gift.
Even a day like Christmas.
Dad's doing it again.
- It?
- It.
It.
- He's having an affair.
- What?
Why?
I don't know.
I guess he's not getting everything out of his relationship with Jordan.
- Ew.
No.
I mean, what makes you think he's messing around?
Oh.
Well, there's the secret phone calls.
There's the long lunches that are not on the calendar.
- And then there's the apartment.
- What apartment?
Okay, ever since Dad started acting all suspicious, I started following him.
- Harry.
- What?
Three times a week he goes to this place.
He spends, like, half an hour 45 minutes, then he leaves.
Look, I know Dad's got a less than stellar track record in the fidelity department, but I don't think we should jump to conclusions until we have proof.
- I know.
I know.
You're right.
I know what I'm bringing for Christmas dinner.
- What's that?
- Proof.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Someone killed Santa?
I know.
It's pretty creepy, huh?
But I think he died of natural causes.
He must be one of those gentlemen from the mall or something.
I came by to grab something, but do you need me to bag personals?
No.
All he has is a black bag of presents that's already been processed.
We're lucky.
The holidays is one of the most violent times of the year.
- But he's our only fatality brought in.
- Lf he's the only dead guy in town what are the odds Saint Nick's gonna open his eyes and whisper:
"Ho, ho, help me."
- City Morgue.
- Hey, Davis, it's me.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna be a little late for our dinner tonight.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm at the youth center for our department's community relations program.
There you go.
And we hired a Santa to bring some presents to the underprivileged kids and the guy hasn't shown up yet.
And the kids are gonna be so disappointed.
He's just gonna be another person in their lives who's let them down.
Yes.
Carrie, I think I might know what happened to him.
Really?
What?
- He's probably stuck in holiday traffic.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- Anyway, I'll get there as soon as I can.
- I'll see you later.
Well, hey, if it makes you feel any better you're welcome to join me and Harry tonight.
No, that's okay.
It's been a while since I've spent the holidays with a...
With a woman, so I think I'll just...
I'll wait for her.
- All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
I wish I could make her understand, but that's not possible.
If she finds out, there's no telling what it'll do to her.
The most important thing right now is that she trust me.
Hi, Dad.
Help me.
Harrison, you're late again.
And frankly, I'm running out of expletives, so here's the deal.
I have the night off, and I'm not spending it waiting for you.
So as un-festive as it sounds you can find me at the lab, catching up on work.
I'll be the one cutting out a spleen and pretending it's yours.
Next time I talk to you, you better have a good reason for standing me up on Christmas Eve.
Harrison, will you let me explain?
Jack.
You work with Jack Harper.
I thought you were having an affair.
- What are you talking about?
- Those calls.
Those calls weren't about your wife, they were about Tru!
Look, I heard Tru mention that this guy Jack was harassing her.
So I'm trying to protect my daughter.
- Since when is that a crime?
- How about when it's a damn lie.
All right, you want the truth?
Well, it'd be a nice change of pace.
Jack Harper contacted me with some very strange stories about your sister.
He told me she had this gift.
Then he told me to meet him here today and that's what I was doing.
- So that was the first time you met him?
- Yes.
I've seen you go to that apartment three times this week.
Dad...
I always knew you were smart, son.
Tru was better with the books, but you, you know people.
You have no idea what you are dealing with.
Then tell me, what am I dealing with?
Look, I wanna be honest with you, son.
And I want you to understand what is at stake here.
- But you gotta promise me one thing.
- What?
What is that?
You will not mention to Tru what I am about to discuss with you.
It'll be a cold day in hell before I promise you.
I am so sorry to hear that.
Dad.
Harrison, I'm so sorry.
- Whoa.
You scared me.
- A room full of corpses, and I scared you.
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out decking the halls.
I was, and then it dawned on me.
Nobody should be alone on Christmas Eve, not even our friend here.
You know, we haven't had a chance to talk about how you're feeling.
- About?
I just mean, sometimes a near-death experience can have a strange effect on people.
Honestly, I feel great.
I feel better than great.
It's like this huge wake-up call for me, you know?
A chance to reevaluate my priorities.
- In what way?
- Having them, for instance.
I'm not gonna have priorities.
I'm gonna do everything.
You know?
Do whatever I want, devil-may-care.
I like this new Jensen, but I gotta tell you I never really saw you as the devil-may-care kind of guy.
Well, maybe not everybody's as they seem.
Come on, Tru.
Come on, Tru, answer the phone please.
Come on.
Got a text from Avery and Tyler.
Their flights are cancelled.
They're spending Christmas Eve at the airport.
Oh.
That's probably my brother with some lame excuse on why he bailed on me.
Help me.
'Twas the night before Christmas, again.
- Avery, it's Tru.
- Hola, chica.
What's up?
I'm not gonna go to breakfast.
- Work emergency.
- Work emergency.
Right.
You're gonna either need to get a better job or a better excuse.
Right.
But, hey, I was just thinking.
You and Tyler should call the airline before you go in case they cancel your flight.
No one wants to spend Christmas Eve in an airport.
Yes, thank you.
Happy Holidays, Tru.
You too.
You woke me up yesterday too.
- Rough night?
- No.
Unless we're careful, it's gonna be a rough day.
- Harrison followed you to my apartment.
- Thank God it's a new day.
The point is, just be careful around your son today.
Be nice to him.
Find out what he knows.
You know how this works, Richard.
We're not gonna get another chance.
- Hey, boss.
- Harrison.
What can I do for my boy?
Well, I've been thinking.
I've put in a lot of work, some extra hours around the office and I was wondering if I can get a raise.
- A raise?
- I really think...
- Well you certainly deserve it.
Let me take it to the partners and see what they say.
Hey.
Wow.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
- Who killed Santa Claus?
- Natural causes.
Knowing you, he's gonna open his eyes and ask for...
I told that joke yesterday.
He was supposed to deliver toys to kids at the youth center.
- That's where Carrie is.
- I know.
She's gonna miss dinner trying to keep from disappointing them.
- Lf he didn't ask for help, then who did?
- A cadaver.
- Which drawer?
- Not here.
At school.
- Those bodies have been dead for...
- Six months.
I know.
That's why I came here to talk to you first.
I mean, I didn't rewind to six months ago.
So why would a body that's still dead ask for my help?
- One advantage to your predicament.
- What's that?
Well, the clues are always on the body.
And for the first time, you have a body to work with.
For the record, she was dead when I got here.
- Duly noted.
Now, get out.
- Already on my way.
Looks like I got the day off.
Because you're good, Davies.
But you're not that good.
Stale corpse, no clues.
Hey, what if I was to offer to help you with your job today?
What if I was to offer to help you kiss my ass?
That's funny.
No, but really, think of it as a holiday truce.
What harm could I do?
There was only one fatality yesterday and that one already "ho, ho" happened, am I right?
Come on, there's no one to save.
There's no one to fight over.
I might even be helpful.
Jack, there is no way I would ever accept your help.
You try and be a nice guy...
Merry Christmas to all, and to all good luck.
So you asked for my help.
Who are you, and what do you want from me?
So you talk to them too?
You have this way of catching me off guard.
Wow, so you blew off breakfast for schoolwork.
When you said work emergency, I just assumed that you meant...
I just feel I've been getting behind, with all the classes I've missed.
Right, right, right.
Then why is it that you're working on another group's cadaver instead of ours?
- Checking up on their work.
- I do the same thing.
You picked a good one too.
You feel that?
- It's like her skull is cracked.
- Exactly.
And you see the small pinpoint blotches around her eyes?
- Petechial hemorrhage.
- And you said you were falling behind.
- So this woman died from asphyxiation.
- She was murdered by it.
Probably fell postmortem, led to the cranium fracture.
A lecture the professor gave one of the days you were gone.
He said it was pretty rare to find a body that met an unnatural demise.
Well, not in my line of work.
Anyway, I've got some last-minute shopping to do, but thanks for your help.
Any time.
Later.
Let me guess, you think Dad's having an affair.
- I still hate it when you do that.
- Well, I hate it when you stand me up.
You didn't show last night.
What happened?
Well, it's hard to say without me reliving the day and all.
So, I guess we already talked about Dad's phone calls and this thing with the apartment?
- Yep.
I think he knows I'm on to him, because he's been way too nice.
- Like he's hiding something.
- Relax, Harry.
- Not everyone lives a secret life.
- Right, just you.
Goodbye, Harr.
Come on.
It's a black sack with presents in it.
Yes, I understand the irony.
Yes.
Can you just tell me when it's gonna be released from processing, please?
- Uh...
Okay, thank you.
God.
- No luck?
You'd think being the medical examiner that I'd have some pull around here.
I know you want to help Carrie and all but technically, those gifts were his possessions.
Which he was gonna give to the kids.
I think that it would be easier if I told Carrie how I know it's gonna happen.
Okay, sorry.
Any word on that cadaver?
All I know is the woman who asked for help was murdered.
I mean, I don't even have a name, not to mention that the identity of all anatomical gifts are confidential.
So to make a long story suck, I got nothing.
You know, there is one person that would be able to help.
Someone who saw what the victim saw when she died.
No.
No.
I mean, are you crazy?
- I can't trust him after what he's done.
- You said it yourself.
You have nothing.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Can be smart enough to not buddy up with the Reaper.
Ordinarily, I would agree with you.
But since no one's gonna die today, what harm can he do?
I'm sorry, Tru.
I'd love to help you.
Really, I would.
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hear you say those two magic words.
- Please, Jack?
- Ooh.
Sorry.
Those weren't the magic words we were looking for.
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Come on, Tru.
I just wanna hear you say it one time.
- "Help me."
- Would you settle for "Bite me"?
Not if you want what's in here.
- Help me.
- I thought you'd never ask.
Come on.
I don't see why we couldn't carpool.
For someone who's dedicated to saving lives you should really take better care of the environment, Tru.
I've got this thing about not getting into a car with a guy who kills people for a living.
So, what are we doing here?
You wanted to know what I saw in the victim's last day.
Time for show-and-tell.
Most of it was pretty mundane.
A sunrise through a window, a taxi meter a young girl with pigtails.
Something that looked like curtains with red flowers on them blowing in the wind.
And then this broken fence.
I figured what better place to begin than with the end.
The last thing I saw was falling off here.
Looks like we weren't the first ones here today.
What's your money on, coincidence or connection?
Only one way to find out.
Yes, hi.
I just received the most beautiful daisies, but the card fell off so I have no idea who they're from.
I don't want the person to think that I'm being rude by not saying thank you.
Yeah.
Ann Moore is the only person who bought daisies so far today?
- Thank you so much.
Okay, bye-bye.
- Impressive.
Thanks for your help, Jack.
That's it?
Well, I needed a place to start, and now I've got one.
It's nothing personal.
Actually, it's completely personal.
Yeah.
- Hi.
Ann Moore?
- Yes.
I'm from Hudson Medical School.
I'm doing a survey of people who donated a body to science.
- Now is not a good time.
- It'll only take a few minutes.
- I need to identify a cadaver recently...
- Honestly, this isn't something I want to spend Christmas Eve talking about.
If you'll excuse me.
What my colleague failed to mention is that we pay for this information.
Come in.
This money couldn't come at a better time.
- Things have been awful tight.
- We're just glad to be able to help.
So you're here to ask me about my sister, Allison?
Yeah.
This is her.
Do you mind if we ask what happened to her?
She was murdered.
Six months ago, by a man named Russell Marks.
They worked together and were having a relationship on the side.
That is, until Allison found out he was married.
That night, she went over to tell him it was over.
It was the last time anyone saw her alive.
I finished cleaning my room.
Okay, hon.
Go get ready for church.
That's the girl I saw in the cadaver's memory.
- Pretty girl.
- Allison's.
My sister was a single mom, so now I am too.
Miss Moore, if it's not too much, do you know what happened to Russell Marks?
Well he was arrested.
But the jury felt that there was a lack of evidence.
"Reasonable doubt," they said.
I can't believe that he...
He gets to have a life shop for presents, trim the tree with his wife while Allison's body lies in some dark, cold room somewhere.
Where's the justice in that?
I'm sorry.
Is there anything else?
Cambria and I have to go to church.
Saint Matthew's is always so crowded on Christmas Eve.
No, that's it.
Thank you very much.
I don't even get a thanks?
I was brilliant back there.
Does the fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse need a pat on the back?
Whatever.
The fact that I'm still here means that you need me.
And that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Well, be careful.
You wouldn't want the ice around your heart to melt.
Cute.
But seriously, what's next?
Since no one's life needs to be saved, how do we help Allison Moore?
There are a lot of ways to save someone's life, Jack.
- Stopping death is only one of them.
- That sister of hers seemed to have a significant ax to grind with Russell Marks.
- Maybe she was looking for payback.
- But no one dies, remember.
- No one has to.
- So you're saying attempted murder.
- Because if she got caught...
- Then Allison's daughter would be alone.
Thus, the "Help me."
We should find this Russell Marks today and get there before Ann Moore does.
Hey, Tru, I gotta talk to you about...
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Nice to see you, Harrison.
Harry, it's okay, I got it under control.
What's up?
Come here a second.
Okay, I had a talk with Dad, asked him point blank, "Are you having an affair?"
- And?
- He had an answer for everything.
Yeah.
What did I tell you?
But then he said that that apartment was where he meets his L.A. Partners.
But get this.
I got an old poker buddy.
He works for a car service that handles the firm.
Those L.A. Guys aren't due till next week.
See, something is going on.
Tru, I can feel it.
I'm gonna give you two privacy.
You know, that would be just perfect.
What, are you crazy?
Why you all sleeping with the enemy?
There's no "sleeping." He's helping me.
Bottom line, you can't trust him, Tru.
He's probably screwing you right now.
Richard, I hope you're getting this.
Your son is still suspicious.
You'd better get on this, or we're both screwed.
Your brother was a tad frosty to me back there.
Is everything okay with him?
You tried to kill him a few months back.
Were you expecting a hug?
A short memory, the key to a happy life.
Ah!
- Can I help you?
- Hi, Mrs. Marks.
My name's Jack Harper.
We're actually looking for your husband.
Is he at home?
Russell isn't speaking to the press.
I think he's made that perfectly clear.
We're not from the media.
We're with the Neighborhood Watch program.
We're actually just looking for volunteers.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
We're newlyweds.
We just moved in down the block.
I'm sure Russell would love to help out, but he's out doing last-minute shopping.
But then I'm meeting him at Saint Matthew's.
If you're looking for volunteers, church is always a good place to find people.
- She's right.
- Thanks for your advice.
- Maybe we'll see you there.
- Okay.
Good luck.
- Guess who else'll be at church tonight.
- Something tells me we should be there.
That's kind of cute.
That's nice.
I like it.
Are those the eyes?
- Santa's not coming, is he?
- Yes, he is.
He is.
It's just, you know how those reindeer can be.
- That's very nice.
- Miss Allen, you promised us.
I know.
I did.
It's just that sometimes things can happen, even to Santa.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Who do you think that is?
- Santa!
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Davis?
- No, it's Santa.
- What are you doing?
- Explain later.
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Come on, who wants to sit on Santa's lap?
Okay.
Santa wants to make sure that everyone's gone to the bathroom recently, yes?
- Yes.
- Really?
Really?
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Are you even allowed in here?
I'm not the one screwing with the big guy's plans.
If anyone's getting struck by lightning, my money's on you.
Okay, so tell me the truth.
Why are you really helping me today?
As far as I'm concerned, as long as the dead stay dead there's no harm in giving a little help to the living.
Or maybe I just didn't want to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
There's our man.
Mr. Marks?
We don't want to cause any trouble but we're friends of the Moores, and you should know that Ann and Cambria are gonna be here today.
Look, Ann is still very angry about her sister's death.
Rather than disrupt the services, we thought we'd forewarn you.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm an innocent man.
- And I need to move on with my life.
- And what about Allison Moore's life?
- Thank you for your concern.
- Russell.
I'm gonna go enjoy the services with my wife now.
Excuse me.
Well, that went well.
I'm starting to think the jury was right about Marks.
- What makes you say that?
- If there's one thing I know, it's killers.
Once you take a human life, it's like a smell that you can't wash off no matter how hard you try.
And that guy he ain't got the funk.
Ho, ho, ho.
What would you like for Christmas?
- A ferret.
- A ferret?
Okay, I don't think I have any of those.
But have you ever considered a bone saw?
To cut wood for a really neat tree house.
- Thanks, Santa!
- Yeah.
Ho, ho.
And what about you?
What would you like for Christmas?
A bone saw.
I think I'm all out of those.
But how about a splatter guard to keep blood from splattering on your face.
- You're the coolest Santa ever.
- Thank you.
Ho, ho, ho.
And for you, there's a rib separator.
And how about some forceps.
I guess all I can do now is keep Ann Moore away from him.
Yeah, well, if that's the case, then...
Showtime.
There she is.
Come on, we're going home.
- That's it?
- Nothing happened.
- Maybe it hasn't happened yet.
- All right, we gotta split up.
One of us follows Ann, the other stays with Russell.
Okay, I'll stay with Russell.
You follow Ann.
But if anything happens to her, so help me, Jack.
Helping you is what I'm doing, Tru.
What do you mean, you can't stay?
Don't we have other things to talk about?
Hi, Dad.
- Harrison, what are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.
Well, I guess you've already spoiled the surprise.
- Surprise?
- I just signed the lease.
Merry Christmas, son.
It's all yours.
What?
This place?
What is...?
I may not be able to give my new employee a raise.
But the partners can't say anything about a father giving to his son.
I've been working on this for weeks.
But you almost blew the whole thing.
- I'm sorry.
I was thinking...
- Forget it.
Forget it.
It all worked out.
Oh, wow.
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- You too.
Jensen.
Hey, stranger.
What are you doing here?
I guess I just wanted to see what it is I've been missing out on all these years.
And pay my respects.
Who's that for?
That's for my uncle.
He died of a heart attack last year.
And that's for my cousin, who passed away when we were little kids.
You know, think about this.
If things had gone differently you might be lighting one for me.
- But things didn't go differently.
There but for the grace of Tru go I.
So who's that one for?
Nobody.
I gotta get back to the lab, so I'II...
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, Jensen Mr. Gorenstein doesn't need the company tonight.
So I say you ditch the lab and you join me and my brother for Christmas Eve dinner.
You know, in the spirit of doing something new each day.
Okay.
I'll try.
Way of doing this.
- Hello.
- All right, I followed Ann home.
She's not doing much except the crossword puzzle.
How's Marks?
On his way home.
We must have missed something.
Maybe Allison Moore's "Help me" had nothing to do with revenge.
Hold on.
Cambria!
Cambria!
Tru, I think I know who Allison wanted us to stop.
It wasn't Ann.
It was her daughter.
Do you know who I am?
Of course.
From the trial, right?
That's how you know?
Is there anything I can do for you?
You can admit what you did to my mom.
Look, Cambria, I think you should...
You think I should what?
Forgive you?
Or make you pay for what you did before you have a chance to do it to someone else?
Please, honey.
I loved your mother.
I would never have done anything to hurt her.
- No, that's not true!
- I was ready to give up everything.
My job, my marriage, just for a chance to be with her.
Cambria, do you remember me?
I'm a friend of your aunt's.
This isn't what she wants.
She's angry.
She misses your mom just like you do.
But this isn't the answer.
We don't get to decide who lives and who dies who's guilty and who's not.
That's not the way it works.
- It's out of our hands.
- You don't understand.
He killed her and got away with it.
And nothing you do here is gonna change that.
Look, it won't bring your mom back and it won't bring your aunt any more peace.
No one's gonna die tonight.
You're not even gonna hurt him.
You'll miss, and then the only one who will pay is you.
What's going on?
- My God, what is this?
- Honey, go back inside.
Something that looked like curtains with red flowers blowing in the wind.
Maybe it wasn't curtains.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I won't miss.
Okay, and if you don't, then you've just killed someone.
That's something you're gonna have to live with every day for the rest of your life.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Marks?
What's she talking about?
L...
I have no idea.
Cambria, don't make an innocent man pay for someone else's crime.
I know this is a lot to ask but hopefully you won't need to press charges.
No.
I think she's been through enough already.
You're just gonna let her go?
What about us?
Haven't we been through enough?
You're saying she should pay for trying to take your husband from you?
- Exactly.
- Just like Allison Moore, right?
You need to talk to your wife.
Russell.
I did it for us.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Thank you for everything you did today.
I would be more thankful if I understood how you knew to actually do it, but...
Davis.
I've been thinking about what the best thing is to give you for Christmas.
I think the best gift I can give you is...
Is the truth about my life.
What do you mean?
You know how you were asking me how I knew Santa wasn't gonna show up?
Yeah.
It's an interesting story, really.
Um...
It's one that I'm not supposed to talk about.
Davis, you know that you can tell me anything.
Yeah, I know that.
It's...
This is about Tru.
So I gotta ask, why call the cops about Mrs. Marks?
The case was closed.
Why put the family through that again?
You know how you said if there's one thing you know, it's a killer?
Well, I know victims.
I know what it's like to lose someone and not know who took them from you.
I guess I owed a girl who lost her mom.
I gotta tell you, it was cool to wear the white hat for a change.
So you're admitting that I'm the good guy?
Do you know why they gave the white hat to the hero in the Old West movies?
It made them easier to light for the camera.
The color of the hat is not about right or wrong.
It's about what you choose to see.
- Well, I'm this way.
- And I'm this way.
- So I guess I'll be seeing you.
- Until the day you quit.
Or you do.
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
It was.
Merry Christmas, Tru.
Maybe I just didn't want to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
Hey, Jack.
Okay, this doesn't mean that I've forgiven you and this changes absolutely nothing between us but I've always had this feeling that no one should be alone on Christmas Eve.
Oh, look who finally showed up.
- Hey.
- Twice in one day.
What a treat.
Relax, Harry, okay?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
What, pass up the chance to meet all your friends?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
- What was that?
If it's a call for...
- Look...
Merry Christmas, for now.
Okay?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I hope you don't mind.
I brought Moe and Curly.
Yes.
We took your advice, and we called the airlines and our flights were cancelled.
So...
We'd be spending Christmas Eve in an airport.
Uh-huh.
So Jensen is not the only one who owes you one.
It was just a hunch.
Yes.
Merry Christmas.
Hey!
Davis, I thought you guys were having your own holiday dinner.
We did.
But then Davis said that Harrison has a habit of standing you up and we didn't want you to be alone.
- Are you okay?
You never called me to see how things were with Jack.
- Oh, right.
Yeah, how did that go?
- Fine.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
It's probably just the eggnog.
Well, we'll talk later, okay?
When are you gonna tell her that I know the secret?
No, seriously, it's got cuffs.
Right here.
We have the best dad in the freaking world.
He got me an apartment.
He got it pimped out, everything.
- Mighty generous.
- No, not generous, well earned.
Hey.
- Jack Harper.
- Hi.
Yeah, this is my dad, Richard.
Richard, Jack.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You work with my daughter?
- A competitor, actually.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Long day?
Aren't they all?
In my endless pursuit of the holiday spirit there's one thing I haven't done yet.
- What's that?
Oh.
- Wasn't he supposed to be one of yours?
- Give it time.
And what about the mole?
She's got him.
Merry Christmas.
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.
There's the guy making out with my sister.
Enough with the making out.
Don't you go all guardian on me now.
Come on, guys, it's time to make a toast.
Christmas Eve Dinner with Harrison.
As long as she doesn't find out about us.
I have other responsibilities, a wife, my job.
I shouldn't have to worry about you...
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
Can I help you?
Hey, Dad.
I didn't wanna interrupt your phone conversation.
No, it's just somebody about a case I've been working on.
- What can I do for you?
- I've been thinking.
I've been putting in some long hours and some extra work, and I was wondering if I could have a raise.
Also, they raised my rent, and I've been kind of...
I've grown fond of living indoors.
I wish I could help you, Harrison but such a quick pay bump, and for my son.
- You understand how that would look.
- Yeah, I figured.
You can't blame a guy for trying, huh?
Right.
Okay, so you get eight days of Christmas?
Tyler, for the last time, it's called Hanukkah, all right?
If you call it Christmas one more time, I'm gonna shove a menorah up your...
Secret Santas.
We should open up our nondenominational gifts.
Great idea.
Um...
- Ave, you go first.
- Yes.
- Drum roll.
- I got a comb.
And I'm gonna guess that it's from Tyler.
Hey.
What happened to the secret part?
FYI, buddy, the "under 10 dollar" rule that's actually not a contest to see how far under 10 you can keep it.
I know these two are going home for vacation.
If they survive the ride to the airport together.
But what about you?
What are the Davies up to tonight?
Well, it looks like, as usual, my family Christmas Eve will consist of me my brother, Harry, and a toast to the rest of the family who couldn't make it.
Well, on the bright side, there's less cleanup.
- But more therapy.
- You know what?
Coal for you in your stocking.
That's all you'll get.
My people, we don't do the stockings.
None of that.
What is going on with you?
Normally you're all "bah humbug" and grinch-y.
This year, I'm all about the holiday spirit, the tree trimming, the church.
Hell, I might even sit on Santa's lap.
- Lucky Santa.
- Lucky me.
You know, I mean, I shouldn't even be here.
But you saved me.
And I know it sounds dumb, but every day is a gift.
Even a day like Christmas.
Dad's doing it again.
- It?
- It.
It.
- He's having an affair.
- What?
Why?
I don't know.
I guess he's not getting everything he needs out of his relationship with Jordan.
- Ew.
No.
I mean, what makes you think he's messing around?
Oh.
Well, there's the secret phone calls.
There's the long lunches that are not on the calendar.
- And then there's the apartment.
- What apartment?
Okay, ever since Dad started acting all suspicious, I started following him.
- Harry.
- What?
Three times a week he goes to this place.
He spends, like, half an hour 45 minutes, then he leaves.
Look, I know Dad's got a less than stellar track record in the fidelity department, but I don't think we should jump to conclusions until we have proof.
- I know.
I know.
You're right.
I know what I'm bringing for Christmas dinner.
- What's that?
- Proof.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Someone killed Santa?
I know.
It's pretty creepy, huh?
But I think he died of natural causes.
He must be one of those gentlemen from the mall or something.
I came by to grab something, but do you need me to bag personals?
No.
All he has is a black bag of presents that's already been processed.
We're lucky.
The holidays is one of the most violent times of the year.
- But he's our only fatality brought in.
- If he's the only dead guy in town what are the odds Saint Nick's gonna open his eyes and whisper:
"Ho, ho, help me. "
- City Morgue.
- Hey, Davis, it's me.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna be a little late for our dinner tonight.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm at the youth center for our department's community relations program.
There you go.
And we hired a Santa to bring some presents to the underprivileged kids and the guy hasn't shown up yet.
And the kids are gonna be so disappointed.
He's just gonna be another person in their lives who's let them down.
Yes.
Carrie, I think I might know what happened to him.
Really?
What?
He's probably stuck in holiday traffic.
Yeah, you're probably right.
- Anyway, I'll get there as soon as I can.
- I'll see you later.
Well, hey, if it makes you feel any better you're welcome to join me and Harry tonight.
No, that's okay.
It's been a while since I've spent the holidays with a... with a woman, so I think I'll just...
I'll wait for her.
- All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
I wish I could make her understand, but that's not possible.
If she finds out, there's no telling what it'll do to her.
The most important thing right now is that she trust me.
Hi, Dad.
Help me.
"T'was The Night Before Christmas...
Again"
Harrison, you're late again.
And frankly, I'm running out of expletives, so here's the deal.
I have the night off, and I'm not spending it waiting for you.
So as un-festive as it sounds you can find me at the lab, catching up on work.
I'll be the one cutting out a spleen and pretending it's yours.
Next time I talk to you, you better have a good reason for standing me up on Christmas Eve.
Harrison, will you let me explain?
Jack.
You work with Jack Harper.
I thought you were having an affair.
- What are you talking about?
- Those calls.
Those calls weren't about your wife, they were about Tru!
Look, I heard Tru mention that this guy Jack was harassing her.
So I'm trying to protect my daughter.
- Since when is that a crime?
- How about when it's a damn lie.
All right, you want the truth?
Well, it'd be a nice change of pace.
Jack Harper contacted me with some very strange stories about your sister.
He told me she had this gift.
Then he told me if I wanted to hear more I had to meet him here today and that's what I was doing when you walked in.
- So that was the first time you met him?
- Yes.
I've seen you go to that apartment three times this week.
Dad...
I always knew you were smart, son.
Tru was better with the books, but you, you know people.
You have no idea what you are dealing with.
Then tell me, what am I dealing with?
Look, I wanna be honest with you, son.
And I want you to understand what is at stake here.
- But you gotta promise me one thing.
- What?
What is that?
You will not mention to Tru what I am about to discuss with you.
It'll be a cold day in hell before I promise you.
I am so sorry to hear that.
Dad.
Harrison, I'm so sorry.
Whoa.
You scared me.
A room full of corpses, and I'm the one who scared you.
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out decking the halls.
I was, and then it dawned on me.
Nobody should be alone on Christmas Eve, not even our friend here.
You know, we haven't had a chance to talk about how you're feeling.
- About?
I just mean, sometimes a near-death experience can have a strange effect on people.
Honestly, I feel great.
I feel better than great.
It's like this huge wake-up call for me, you know?
A chance to reevaluate my priorities.
- In what way?
- Having them, for instance.
I'm not gonna have priorities.
I'm gonna do everything.
You know?
Do whatever I want, devil-may-care.
I like this new Jensen, but I gotta tell you I never really saw you as the devil-may-care kind of guy.
Well, maybe not everybody's as they seem.
Come on, Tru.
Come on, Tru, answer the phone please.
Come on.
Got a text from Avery and Tyler.
Their flights are cancelled.
They're spending Christmas Eve at the airport.
Oh.
That's probably my brother with some lame excuse on why he bailed on me.
Help me.
'Twas the night before Christmas, again.
- Avery, it's Tru.
- Hola, chica.
What's up?
I'm not gonna go to breakfast.
- Work emergency.
- Work emergency.
Right.
You're gonna either need to get a better job or a better excuse.
Right.
But, hey, I was just thinking.
You and Tyler should call the airline before you go in case they cancel your flight.
No one wants to spend Christmas Eve in an airport.
Yes, thank you.
Happy Holidays, Tru.
You too.
You woke me up yesterday too.
- Rough night?
- No.
But unless we're careful, it's gonna be a rough day.
- Harrison followed you to my apartment.
- Thank God it's a new day.
The point is, just be careful around your son today.
Be nice to him.
Find out what he knows.
You know how this works, Richard.
We're not gonna get another chance.
- Hey, boss.
- Harrison.
What can I do for my boy?
Well, I've been thinking.
I've put in a lot of work, some extra hours around the office and I was wondering if I can get a raise.
- A raise?
- I really think...
- Well you certainly deserve it.
Let me take it to the partners and see what they say.
Hey.
Wow.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
- Who killed Santa Claus?
- Natural causes.
Knowing you, he's gonna open his eyes and ask for...
I told that joke yesterday.
He was supposed to deliver toys to kids at the youth center.
- That's where Carrie is.
- I know.
She's gonna miss dinner trying to keep from disappointing them.
- If he didn't ask for help, then who did?
- A cadaver.
- Which drawer?
- Not here.
At school.
- Those bodies have been dead for...
- Six months.
I know.
That's why I came here to talk to you first.
I mean, I didn't rewind to six months ago.
So why would a body that's still dead ask for my help?
- One advantage to your predicament.
- What's that?
Well, the clues are always on the body.
And for the first time, you have a body to work with.
For the record, she was dead when I got here.
- Duly noted.
Now, get out.
- Already on my way.
Looks like I got the day off.
Because you're good, Davies.
But you're not that good.
Stale corpse, no clues.
Hey, what if I was to offer to help you with your job today?
What if I was to offer to help you kiss my ass?
That's funny.
No, but really, think of it as a holiday truce.
What harm could I do?
There was only one fatality yesterday and that one already "ho, ho" happened, am I right?
Come on, there's no one to save.
There's no one to fight over.
I might even be helpful.
Jack, there is no way I would ever accept your help.
You try and be a nice guy...
Merry Christmas to all, and to all good luck.
So you asked for my help.
Who are you, and what do you want from me?
So you talk to them too?
You have this way of catching me off guard.
Wow, so you blew off breakfast for schoolwork.
When you said work emergency, I just assumed that you meant...
I just feel I've been getting behind, with all the classes I've missed.
Right, right, right.
Then why is it that you're working on another group's cadaver instead of ours?
- Checking up on their work.
- I do the same thing.
You picked a good one too.
You feel that?
- It's like her skull is cracked.
- Exactly.
And you see the small pinpoint blotches around her eyes?
- Petechial hemorrhage.
- And you said you were falling behind.
- So this woman died from asphyxiation.
- She was murdered by it.
Probably fell postmortem, led to the cranium fracture.
A lecture the professor gave one of the days you were gone.
He said it was pretty rare to find a body that met an unnatural demise.
Well, not in my line of work.
Anyway, I've got some last-minute shopping to do, but thanks for your help.
Any time.
Later.
Harryson, let me guess, you think Dad's having an affair.
- I still hate it when you do that.
- Well, I hate it when you stand me up.
You didn't show last night.
What happened?
Well, it's hard to say without me reliving the day and all.
So, I guess we already talked about Dad's phone calls and this thing with the apartment?
- Yep.
I think he knows I'm on to him, because he's been way too nice.
- Like he's hiding something.
- Relax, Harry.
- Not everyone lives a secret life.
- Right, just you.
Goodbye, Harr.
Come on.
ACCESS DENIED
It's a black sack with presents in it.
Yes, I understand the irony.
Yes.
Can you just tell me when it's gonna be released from processing, please?
- Uh...
Okay, thank you.
God.
- No luck?
You'd think being the medical examiner that I'd have some pull around here.
I know you want to help Carrie and all but technically, those gifts were his possessions.
Which he was gonna give to the kids.
I think that it would be easier if I told Carrie how I know it's gonna happen.
Okay, sorry.
Any word on that cadaver?
All I know is the woman who asked for help was murdered.
I mean, I don't even have a name, not to mention that the identity of all anatomical gifts are confidential.
So to make a long story suck, I got nothing.
You know, there is one person that would be able to help.
Someone who saw what the victim saw when she died.
No.
No.
I mean, are you crazy?
I can't trust him after what he's done.
You said it yourself.
You have nothing.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Can be smart enough to not buddy up with the Reaper.
Ordinarily, I would agree with you.
But since no one's gonna die today, what harm can he do?
I'm sorry, Tru.
I'd love to help you.
Really, I would.
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hear you say those two magic words.
- Please, Jack?
- Ooh.
Sorry.
Those weren't the magic words we were looking for.
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Come on, Tru.
I just wanna hear you say it one time.
- "Help me. "
- Would you settle for "Bite me"?
Not if you want what's in here.
- Help me.
- I thought you'd never ask.
Come on.
I don't see why we couldn't carpool.
For someone who's dedicated to saving lives you should really take better care of the environment, Tru.
I've got this thing about not getting into a car with a guy who kills people for a living.
So, what are we doing here?
You wanted to know what I saw in the victim's last day.
Time for show-and-tell.
Most of it was pretty mundane.
A sunrise through a window, a taxi meter a young girl with pigtails.
Something that looked like curtains with red flowers on them blowing in the wind.
And then this broken fence.
I figured what better place to begin than with the end.
The last thing I saw was falling off here.
Looks like we weren't the first ones here today.
What's your money on, coincidence or connection?
Only one way to find out.
Yes, hi.
I just received the most beautiful daisies, but the card fell off so I have no idea who they're from.
I don't want the person to think that I'm being rude by not saying thank you.
Yeah.
Ann Moore is the only person who bought daisies so far today?
- Thank you so much.
Okay, bye-bye.
- Impressive.
Thanks for your help, Jack.
That's it?
Well, I needed a place to start, and now I've got one.
It's nothing personal.
Actually, it's completely personal.
Yeah.
- Hi.
Ann Moore?
- Yes.
I'm from Hudson Medical School.
I'm doing a survey of people who donated the body of their loved ones to science.
- Now is not a good time.
- It'll only take a few minutes.
- I need to identify a cadaver recently...
- Honestly, this isn't something I want to spend Christmas Eve talking about.
If you'll excuse me.
What my colleague failed to mention is that we pay for this information.
Come in.
This money couldn't come at a better time.
- Things have been awful tight.
- We're just glad to be able to help.
So you're here to ask me about my sister, Allison?
Yeah.
This is her.
Do you mind if we ask what happened to her?
She was murdered.
Six months ago, by a man named Russell Marks.
They worked together and were having a relationship on the side.
That is, until Allison found out he was married.
That night, she went over to tell him it was over.
It was the last time anyone saw her alive.
I finished cleaning my room.
Okay, hon.
Go get ready for church.
That's the girl I saw in the cadaver's memory.
- Pretty girl.
- Allison's.
My sister was a single mom, so now I am too.
Miss Moore, if it's not too much, do you know what happened to Russell Marks?
Well he was arrested.
But the jury felt that there was a lack of evidence.
"Reasonable doubt," they said.
I can't believe that he...
He gets to have a life shop for presents, trim the tree with his wife while Allison's body lies in some dark, cold room somewhere.
Where's the justice in that?
I'm sorry.
Is there anything else?
Cambria and I have to go to church.
Saint Matthew's is always so crowded on Christmas Eve.
No, that's it.
Thank you very much.
I don't even get a thanks?
I was brilliant back there.
Does the fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse need a pat on the back?
Whatever.
The fact that I'm still here means that you need me.
And that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Well, be careful.
You wouldn't want the ice around your heart to melt.
Cute.
But seriously, what's next?
Since no one's life needs to be saved, how do we help Allison Moore?
There are a lot of ways to save someone's life, Jack.
- Stopping death is only one of them.
- That sister of hers seemed to have a significant ax to grind with Russell Marks.
- Maybe she was looking for payback.
- But no one dies, remember.
- No one has to.
- So you're saying attempted murder.
- Because if she got caught...
- Then Allison's daughter would be alone.
Thus, the "Help me."
We should find this Russell Marks today and get there before Ann Moore does.
Hey, Tru, I gotta talk to you about...
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Nice to see you, Harrison.
Harry, it's okay, I got it under control.
What's up?
Come here a second.
Okay, I had a talk with Dad, asked him point blank, "Are you having an affair?"
- And?
- He had an answer for everything.
Yeah.
What did I tell you?
But then he said that that apartment was where he meets his L.A. Partners.
But get this.
I got an old poker buddy.
He works for a car service that handles the firm.
Those L.A. Guys aren't due till next week.
See, something is going on, Tru.
I can feel it.
I'm gonna give you two privacy.
You know, that would be just perfect.
What, are you crazy?
Why you all sleeping with the enemy?
There's no "sleeping. " He's helping me.
Bottom line, you can't trust him, Tru.
He's probably screwing you right now.
Richard, I hope you're getting this.
Your son is still suspicious.
You'd better get on this, or we're both screwed.
Your brother was a tad frosty to me back there.
Is everything okay with him?
You tried to kill him a few months back.
Were you expecting a hug?
A short memory, the key to a happy life.
- Can I help you?
- Hi, Mrs. Marks.
My name's Jack Harper.
We're actually looking for your husband.
Is he at home?
Russell isn't speaking to the press.
I think he's made that perfectly clear.
We're not from the media.
We're with the Neighborhood Watch program.
We're actually just looking for volunteers.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
We're newlyweds.
We just moved in down the block.
I'm sure Russell would love to help out, but he's out doing last-minute shopping.
But then I'm meeting him at Saint Matthew's.
If you're looking for volunteers, church is always a good place to find people.
- She's right.
- Thanks for your advice.
- Maybe we'll see you there.
- Okay.
Good luck.
Guess who else'll be at church tonight.
Something tells me we should be there too.
That's kind of cute.
That's nice.
I like it.
Are those the eyes?
- Santa's not coming, is he?
- Yes, he is.
He is.
It's just, you know how those reindeer can be.
- That's very nice.
- Miss Allen, you promised us.
I know.
I did.
It's just that sometimes things can happen, even to Santa.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Who do you think that is?
- Santa!
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Davis?
- No, it's Santa.
- What are you doing?
- Explain later.
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Come on, who wants to sit on Santa's lap?
Okay.
Santa wants to make sure that everyone's gone to the bathroom recently, yes?
- Yes.
- Really?
Really?
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Are you even allowed in here?
I'm not the one screwing with the big guy's plans.
If anyone's getting struck by lightning, my money's on you.
Okay, so tell me the truth.
Why are you really helping me today?
As far as I'm concerned, as long as the dead stay dead there's no harm in giving a little help to the living.
Or maybe I just didn't want to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
There's our man.
Mr. Marks?
We don't want to cause any trouble but we're friends of the Moores, and you should know that Ann and Cambria are gonna be here today.
Look, Ann is still very angry about her sister's death.
Rather than disrupt the services, we thought we'd forewarn you.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm an innocent man.
- And I need to move on with my life.
- And what about Allison Moore's life?
- Thank you for your concern.
- Russell.
I'm gonna go enjoy the services with my wife now.
Excuse me.
Well, that went well.
I'm starting to think the jury was right about Marks.
- What makes you say that?
- If there's one thing I know, it's killers.
Once you take a human life, it's like a smell that you can't wash off no matter how hard you try.
And that guy he ain't got the funk.
Ho, ho, ho.
What would you like for Christmas?
- A ferret.
- A ferret?
Okay, I don't think I have any of those.
But have you ever considered a bone saw?
To cut wood for a really neat tree house.
- Thanks, Santa!
- Yeah.
Ho, ho.
And what about you?
What would you like for Christmas?
A bone saw.
I think I'm all out of those.
But how about a splatter guard to keep blood from splattering on your face.
- You're the coolest Santa ever.
- Thank you.
Ho, ho, ho.
And for you, there's a rib separator.
And how about some forceps.
I guess all I can do now is keep Ann Moore away from him.
Yeah, well, if that's the case, then...
Showtime.
There she is.
Come on, we're going home.
- That's it?
- Nothing happened.
- Maybe it hasn't happened yet.
- All right, we gotta split up.
One of us follows Ann, the other stays with Russell.
Okay, I'll stay with Russell.
You follow Ann.
But if anything happens to her, so help me, Jack.
Helping you is what I'm doing, Tru.
What do you mean, you can't stay?
Don't we have other things to talk about?
Hi, Dad.
- Harrison, what are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.
Well, I guess you've already spoiled the surprise.
- Surprise?
- I just signed the lease.
Merry Christmas, son.
It's all yours.
What?
This place?
What is...?
I may not be able to give my new employee a raise.
But the partners can't say anything about a father giving to his son.
I've been working on this for weeks.
But you almost blew the whole thing.
- I'm sorry.
I was thinking...
- Forget it.
Forget it.
It all worked out.
Oh, wow.
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- You too.
Jensen.
Hey, stranger.
What are you doing here?
I guess I just wanted to see what it is I've been missing out on all these years.
And pay my respects.
Who's that for?
That's for my uncle.
He died of a heart attack last year.
And that's for my cousin, who passed away when we were little kids.
You know, think about this.
If things had gone differently you might be lighting one for me.
- But things didn't go differently.
There but for the grace of Tru go I.
So who's that one for?
Nobody.
I gotta get back to the lab, so I'll...
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, Jensen Mr. Gorenstein doesn't need the company tonight.
So I say you ditch the lab and you join me and my brother for Christmas Eve dinner.
You know, in the spirit of doing something new each day.
Okay.
I'll try.
Way of doing this.
- Hello.
- All right, I followed Ann home.
She's not doing much except the crossword puzzle.
How's Marks?
On his way home.
We must have missed something.
Maybe Allison Moore's "Help me" had nothing to do with revenge.
Hold on.
Cambria!
Cambria!
Tru, I think I know who Allison wanted us to stop.
It wasn't Ann.
It was her daughter.
Do you know who I am?
Of course.
From the trial, right?
That's how you know?
Is there anything I can do for you?
You can admit what you did to my mom.
Look, Cambria, I think you should...
You think I should what?
Forgive you?
Or make you pay for what you did before you have a chance to do it to someone else?
Please, honey.
I loved your mother.
I would never have done anything to hurt her.
- No, that's not true!
- I was ready to give up everything.
My job, my marriage, just for a chance to be with her.
Cambria, do you remember me?
I'm a friend of your aunt's.
This isn't what she wants.
She's angry.
She misses your mom just like you do.
But this isn't the answer.
We don't get to decide who lives and who dies who's guilty and who's not.
That's not the way it works.
- It's out of our hands.
- You don't understand.
He killed her and got away with it.
And nothing you do here is gonna change that.
Look, it won't bring your mom back and it won't bring your aunt any more peace.
No one's gonna die tonight.
You're not even gonna hurt him.
You'll miss, and then the only one who will pay is you.
What's going on?
- My God, what is this?
- Honey, go back inside.
Something that looked like curtains with red flowers blowing in the wind.
Maybe it wasn't curtains.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I won't miss.
Okay, and if you don't, then you've just killed someone.
That's something you're gonna have to live with every day for the rest of your life.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Marks?
What's she talking about?
L...
I have no idea.
Cambria, don't make an innocent man pay for someone else's crime.
I know this is a lot to ask but hopefully you won't need to press charges.
No.
I think she's been through enough already.
You're just gonna let her go?
What about us?
Haven't we been through enough?
You're saying she should pay for trying to take your husband from you?
- Exactly.
- Just like Allison Moore, right?
You need to talk to your wife.
Russell.
I did it for us.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Thank you for everything you did today.
I would be more thankful if I understood... how you knew to actually do it, but...
Davis.
I've been thinking about what the best thing is to give you for Christmas.
I think the best gift I can give you is...
Is the truth about my life.
What do you mean?
You know how you were asking me how I knew Santa wasn't gonna show up?
Yeah.
It's an interesting story, really.
Um...
It's one that I'm not supposed to talk about.
Davis, you know that you can tell me anything.
Yeah, I know that.
It's...
This is about Tru.
So I gotta ask, why call the cops about Mrs. Marks?
The case was closed.
Why put the family through that again?
You know how you said if there's one thing you know, it's a killer?
Well, I know victims.
I know what it's like to lose someone and not know who took them from you.
I guess I owed a girl who lost her mom.
I gotta tell you, it was cool to wear the white hat for a change.
So you're admitting that I'm the good guy?
Do you know why they gave the white hat to the hero in the Old West movies?
It made them easier to light for the camera.
The color of the hat is not about right or wrong.
It's about what you choose to see.
- Well, I'm this way.
- And I'm this way.
- So I guess I'll be seeing you.
- Until the day you quit.
Or you do.
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
It was.
Merry Christmas, Tru.
Maybe I just didn't want to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
Hey, Jack.
Okay, this doesn't mean that I've forgiven you and this changes absolutely nothing between us but I've always had this feeling that no one should be alone on Christmas Eve.
Oh, look who finally showed up.
- Hey.
- Twice in one day.
What a treat.
Relax, Harry, okay?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
What, pass up the chance to meet all your friends?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
- What was that?
If it's a call for...
- Look...
Merry Christmas, for now.
Okay?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I hope you don't mind.
I brought Moe and Curly.
Yes.
We took your advice, and we called the airlines and our flights were cancelled.
So...
We'd be spending Christmas Eve in an airport.
Uh-huh.
So Jensen is not the only one who owes you one.
It was just a hunch.
Yes.
Merry Christmas.
Hey!
Davis, I thought you guys were having your own holiday dinner.
We did.
But then Davis said that Harrison has a habit of standing you up and we didn't want you to be alone.
- Are you okay?
You never called me to see how things were with Jack.
- Oh, right.
Yeah, how did that go?
- Fine.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
It's probably just the eggnog.
Well, we'll talk later, okay?
When are you gonna tell her that I know the secret?
No, seriously, it's got cuffs.
Right here.
We have the best dad in the freaking world.
He got me an apartment.
He got it pimped out, everything.
- Mighty generous.
- No, not generous, well earned.
Hey.
- Jack Harper.
- Hi.
Yeah, this is my dad, Richard.
Richard, Jack.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You work with my daughter?
- A competitor, actually.
Excuse me.
Long day?
Aren't they all?
In my endless pursuit of the holiday spirit there's one thing I haven't done yet.
- What's that?
Oh.
- Wasn't he supposed to be one of yours?
- Give it time.
And what about the mole?
She's got him.
Merry Christmas.
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.
There's the guy making out with my sister.
Enough with the making out.
Don't you go all guardian on me now.
Come on, guys, it's time to make a toast.
As long as she doesn't find out about us.
I have other responsibilities, a wife, my job.
I shouldn't have to worry about you...
I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.
Can I help you?
Hey, Dad.
I didn't wanna interrupt your phone conversation.
No, it's just somebody about a case I've been working on.
- What can I do for you?
- I've been thinking.
I've been putting in some long hours and some extra work, and I was wondering if I could have a raise.
Also, they raised my rent, and I've been kind of...
I've grown fond of living indoors.
I wish I could help you, Harrison but such a quick pay bump, and for my son.
- You understand how that would look.
- Yeah, I figured.
You can't blame a guy for trying, huh?
Right.
Okay, so you get eight days of Christmas?
Tyler, for the last time, it's called Hanukkah, all right?
If you call it Christmas one more time, I'm gonna shove a menorah up your...
Secret Santas.
We should open up our nondenominational gifts.
Great idea.
Um...
- Ave, you go first.
- Yes.
- Drum roll.
- I got a comb.
And I'm gonna guess that it's from Tyler.
Hey.
What happened to the secret part?
FYI, buddy, the "under 10 dollar" rule that's actually not a contest to see how far under 10 you can keep it.
I know these two are going home for vacation.
If they survive the ride to the airport together.
But what about you?
What are the Davies up to tonight?
Well, it looks like, as usual, my family Christmas Eve will consist of me my brother, Harry, and a toast to the rest of the family who couldn't make it.
Well, on the bright side, there's less cleanup.
- But more therapy.
- You know what?
Coal for you in your stocking.
That's all you'll get.
My people, we don't do the stockings.
None of that.
What is going on with you?
Normally you're all "bah humbug" and grinch-y.
This year, I'm all about the holiday spirit, the tree trimming, the church.
- Hell, I might even sit on Santa's lap.
- Lucky Santa.
Lucky me.
You know, I mean, I shouldn't even be here.
But you saved me.
And I know it sounds dumb, but every day is a gift.
Even a day like Christmas.
Dad's doing it again.
- It?
- It.
It.
- He's having an affair.
- What?
Why?
I don't know.
I guess he's not getting everything out of his relationship with Jordan.
- Ew.
No.
I mean, what makes you think he's messing around?
Oh.
Well, there's the secret phone calls.
There's the long lunches that are not on the calendar.
- And then there's the apartment.
- What apartment?
Okay, ever since Dad started acting all suspicious, I started following him.
- Harry.
- What?
Three times a week he goes to this place.
He spends, like, half an hour 45 minutes, then he leaves.
Look, I know Dad's got a less than stellar track record in the fidelity department, but I don't think we should jump to conclusions until we have proof.
- I know.
I know.
You're right.
I know what I'm bringing for Christmas dinner.
- What's that?
- Proof.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Someone killed Santa?
I know.
It's pretty creepy, huh?
But I think he died of natural causes.
He must be one of those gentlemen from the mall or something.
I came by to grab something, but do you need me to bag personals?
No.
All he has is a black bag of presents that's already been processed.
We're lucky.
The holidays is one of the most violent times of the year.
- But he's our only fatality brought in.
- Lf he's the only dead guy in town what are the odds Saint Nick's gonna open his eyes and whisper:
"Ho, ho, help me."
- City Morgue.
- Hey, Davis, it's me.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna be a little late for our dinner tonight.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, I'm at the youth center for our department's community relations program.
There you go.
And we hired a Santa to bring some presents to the underprivileged kids and the guy hasn't shown up yet.
And the kids are gonna be so disappointed.
He's just gonna be another person in their lives who's let them down.
Yes.
Carrie, I think I might know what happened to him.
Really?
What?
- He's probably stuck in holiday traffic.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- Anyway, I'll get there as soon as I can.
- I'll see you later.
Well, hey, if it makes you feel any better you're welcome to join me and Harry tonight.
No, that's okay.
It's been a while since I've spent the holidays with a...
With a woman, so I think I'll just...
I'll wait for her.
- All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
I wish I could make her understand, but that's not possible.
If she finds out, there's no telling what it'll do to her.
The most important thing right now is that she trust me.
Hi, Dad.
Harrison, you're late again.
And frankly, I'm running out of expletives, so here's the deal.
I have the night off, and I'm not spending it waiting for you.
So as un-festive as it sounds you can find me at the lab, catching up on work.
I'll be the one cutting out a spleen and pretending it's yours.
Next time I talk to you, you better have a good reason for standing me up on Christmas Eve.
Harrison, will you let me explain?
Jack.
You work with Jack Harper.
I thought you were having an affair.
- What are you talking about?
- Those calls.
Those calls weren't about your wife, they were about Tru!
Look, I heard Tru mention that this guy Jack was harassing her.
So I'm trying to protect my daughter.
- Since when is that a crime?
- How about when it's a damn lie.
All right, you want the truth?
Well, it'd be a nice change of pace.
Jack Harper contacted me with some very strange stories about your sister.
He told me she had this gift.
Then he told me to meet him here today and that's what I was doing.
- So that was the first time you met him?
- Yes.
I've seen you go to that apartment three times this week.
Dad...
I always knew you were smart, son.
Tru was better with the books, but you, you know people.
You have no idea what you are dealing with.
Then tell me, what am I dealing with?
Look, I wanna be honest with you, son.
And I want you to understand what is at stake here.
- But you gotta promise me one thing.
- What?
What is that?
You will not mention to Tru what I am about to discuss with you.
It'll be a cold day in hell before I promise you.
I am so sorry to hear that.
Dad.
Harrison, I'm so sorry.
- Whoa.
You scared me.
- A room full of corpses, and I scared you.
Sorry.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out decking the halls.
I was, and then it dawned on me.
Nobody should be alone on Christmas Eve, not even our friend here.
You know, we haven't had a chance to talk about how you're feeling.
- About?
I just mean, sometimes a near-death experience can have a strange effect on people.
Honestly, I feel great.
I feel better than great.
It's like this huge wake-up call for me, you know?
A chance to reevaluate my priorities.
- In what way?
- Having them, for instance.
I'm not gonna have priorities.
I'm gonna do everything.
You know?
Do whatever I want, devil-may-care.
I like this new Jensen, but I gotta tell you I never really saw you as the devil-may-care kind of guy.
Well, maybe not everybody's as they seem.
Come on, Tru.
Come on, Tru, answer the phone please.
Come on.
Got a text from Avery and Tyler.
Their flights are cancelled.
They're spending Christmas Eve at the airport.
Oh.
That's probably my brother with some lame excuse on why he bailed on me.
Help me.
'Twas the night before Christmas, again.
- Avery, it's Tru.
- Hola, chica.
What's up?
I'm not gonna go to breakfast.
- Work emergency.
- Work emergency.
Right.
You're gonna either need to get a better job or a better excuse.
Right.
But, hey, I was just thinking.
You and Tyler should call the airline before you go in case they cancel your flight.
No one wants to spend Christmas Eve in an airport.
Yes, thank you.
Happy Holidays, Tru.
You too.
You woke me up yesterday too.
- Rough night?
- No.
Unless we're careful, it's gonna be a rough day.
- Harrison followed you to my apartment.
- Thank God it's a new day.
The point is, just be careful around your son today.
Be nice to him.
Find out what he knows.
You know how this works, Richard.
We're not gonna get another chance.
- Hey, boss.
- Harrison.
What can I do for my boy?
Well, I've been thinking.
I've put in a lot of work, some extra hours around the office and I was wondering if I can get a raise.
- A raise?
- I really think...
- Well you certainly deserve it.
Let me take it to the partners and see what they say.
Hey.
Wow.
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
- Who killed Santa Claus?
- Natural causes.
Knowing you, he's gonna open his eyes and ask for...
I told that joke yesterday.
He was supposed to deliver toys to kids at the youth center.
- That's where Carrie is.
- I know.
She's gonna miss dinner trying to keep from disappointing them.
- Lf he didn't ask for help, then who did?
- A cadaver.
- Which drawer?
- Not here.
At school.
- Those bodies have been dead for...
- Six months.
I know.
That's why I came here to talk to you first.
I mean, I didn't rewind to six months ago.
So why would a body that's still dead ask for my help?
- One advantage to your predicament.
- What's that?
Well, the clues are always on the body.
And for the first time, you have a body to work with.
For the record, she was dead when I got here.
- Duly noted.
Now, get out.
- Already on my way.
Looks like I got the day off.
Because you're good, Davies.
But you're not that good.
Stale corpse, no clues.
Hey, what if I was to offer to help you with your job today?
What if I was to offer to help you kiss my ass?
That's funny.
No, but really, think of it as a holiday truce.
What harm could I do?
There was only one fatality yesterday and that one already "ho, ho" happened, am I right?
Come on, there's no one to save.
There's no one to fight over.
I might even be helpful.
Jack, there is no way I would ever accept your help.
You try and be a nice guy...
Merry Christmas to all, and to all good luck.
So you asked for my help.
Who are you, and what do you want from me?
So you talk to them too?
You have this way of catching me off guard.
Wow, so you blew off breakfast for schoolwork.
When you said work emergency, I just assumed that you meant...
I just feel I've been getting behind, with all the classes I've missed.
Right, right, right.
Then why is it that you're working on another group's cadaver instead of ours?
- Checking up on their work.
- I do the same thing.
You picked a good one too.
You feel that?
- It's like her skull is cracked.
- Exactly.
And you see the small pinpoint blotches around her eyes?
- Petechial hemorrhage.
- And you said you were falling behind.
- So this woman died from asphyxiation.
- She was murdered by it.
Probably fell postmortem, led to the cranium fracture.
A lecture the professor gave one of the days you were gone.
He said it was pretty rare to find a body that met an unnatural demise.
Well, not in my line of work.
Anyway, I've got some last-minute shopping to do, but thanks for your help.
Any time.
Later.
Let me guess, you think Dad's having an affair.
- I still hate it when you do that.
- Well, I hate it when you stand me up.
You didn't show last night.
What happened?
Well, it's hard to say without me reliving the day and all.
So, I guess we already talked about Dad's phone calls and this thing with the apartment?
- Yep.
I think he knows I'm on to him, because he's been way too nice.
- Like he's hiding something.
- Relax, Harry.
- Not everyone lives a secret life.
- Right, just you.
Goodbye, Harr.
Come on.
It's a black sack with presents in it.
Yes, I understand the irony.
Yes.
Can you just tell me when it's gonna be released from processing, please?
- Uh...
Okay, thank you.
God.
- No luck?
You'd think being the medical examiner that I'd have some pull around here.
I know you want to help Carrie and all but technically, those gifts were his possessions.
Which he was gonna give to the kids.
I think that it would be easier if I told Carrie how I know it's gonna happen.
Okay, sorry.
Any word on that cadaver?
All I know is the woman who asked for help was murdered.
I mean, I don't even have a name, not to mention that the identity of all anatomical gifts are confidential.
So to make a long story suck, I got nothing.
You know, there is one person that would be able to help.
Someone who saw what the victim saw when she died.
No.
No.
I mean, are you crazy?
- I can't trust him after what he's done.
- You said it yourself.
You have nothing.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Can be smart enough to not buddy up with the Reaper.
Ordinarily, I would agree with you.
But since no one's gonna die today, what harm can he do?
I'm sorry, Tru.
I'd love to help you.
Really, I would.
But I'm afraid I'm gonna have to hear you say those two magic words.
- Please, Jack?
- Ooh.
Sorry.
Those weren't the magic words we were looking for.
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Come on, Tru.
I just wanna hear you say it one time.
- "Help me."
- Would you settle for "Bite me"?
Not if you want what's in here.
- Help me.
- I thought you'd never ask.
Come on.
I don't see why we couldn't carpool.
For someone who's dedicated to saving lives you should really take better care of the environment, Tru.
I've got this thing about not getting into a car with a guy who kills people for a living.
So, what are we doing here?
You wanted to know what I saw in the victim's last day.
Time for show-and-tell.
Most of it was pretty mundane.
A sunrise through a window, a taxi meter a young girl with pigtails.
Something that looked like curtains with red flowers on them blowing in the wind.
And then this broken fence.
I figured what better place to begin than with the end.
The last thing I saw was falling off here.
Looks like we weren't the first ones here today.
What's your money on, coincidence or connection?
Only one way to find out.
Yes, hi.
I just received the most beautiful daisies, but the card fell off so I have no idea who they're from.
I don't want the person to think that I'm being rude by not saying thank you.
Yeah.
Ann Moore is the only person who bought daisies so far today?
- Thank you so much.
Okay, bye-bye.
- Impressive.
Thanks for your help, Jack.
That's it?
Well, I needed a place to start, and now I've got one.
It's nothing personal.
Actually, it's completely personal.
Yeah.
- Hi.
Ann Moore?
- Yes.
I'm from Hudson Medical School.
I'm doing a survey of people who donated a body to science.
- Now is not a good time.
- It'll only take a few minutes.
- I need to identify a cadaver recently...
- Honestly, this isn't something I want to spend Christmas Eve talking about.
If you'll excuse me.
What my colleague failed to mention is that we pay for this information.
Come in.
This money couldn't come at a better time.
- Things have been awful tight.
- We're just glad to be able to help.
So you're here to ask me about my sister, Allison?
Yeah.
This is her.
Do you mind if we ask what happened to her?
She was murdered.
Six months ago, by a man named Russell Marks.
They worked together and were having a relationship on the side.
That is, until Allison found out he was married.
That night, she went over to tell him it was over.
It was the last time anyone saw her alive.
I finished cleaning my room.
Okay, hon.
Go get ready for church.
That's the girl I saw in the cadaver's memory.
- Pretty girl.
- Allison's.
My sister was a single mom, so now I am too.
Miss Moore, if it's not too much, do you know what happened to Russell Marks?
Well he was arrested.
But the jury felt that there was a lack of evidence.
"Reasonable doubt," they said.
I can't believe that he...
He gets to have a life shop for presents, trim the tree with his wife while Allison's body lies in some dark, cold room somewhere.
Where's the justice in that?
I'm sorry.
Is there anything else?
Cambria and I have to go to church.
Saint Matthew's is always so crowded on Christmas Eve.
No, that's it.
Thank you very much.
I don't even get a thanks?
I was brilliant back there.
Does the fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse need a pat on the back?
Whatever.
The fact that I'm still here means that you need me.
And that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
Well, be careful.
You wouldn't want the ice around your heart to melt.
Cute.
But seriously, what's next?
Since no one's life needs to be saved, how do we help Allison Moore?
There are a lot of ways to save someone's life, Jack.
- Stopping death is only one of them.
- That sister of hers seemed to have a significant ax to grind with Russell Marks.
- Maybe she was looking for payback.
- But no one dies, remember.
- No one has to.
- So you're saying attempted murder.
- Because if she got caught...
- Then Allison's daughter would be alone.
Thus, the "Help me."
We should find this Russell Marks today and get there before Ann Moore does.
Hey, Tru, I gotta talk to you about...
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Nice to see you, Harrison.
Harry, it's okay, I got it under control.
What's up?
Come here a second.
Okay, I had a talk with Dad, asked him point blank, "Are you having an affair?"
- And?
- He had an answer for everything.
Yeah.
What did I tell you?
But then he said that that apartment was where he meets his L.A. Partners.
But get this.
I got an old poker buddy.
He works for a car service that handles the firm.
Those L.A. Guys aren't due till next week.
See, something is going on.
Tru, I can feel it.
I'm gonna give you two privacy.
You know, that would be just perfect.
What, are you crazy?
Why you all sleeping with the enemy?
There's no "sleeping." He's helping me.
Bottom line, you can't trust him, Tru.
He's probably screwing you right now.
Richard, I hope you're getting this.
Your son is still suspicious.
You'd better get on this, or we're both screwed.
Your brother was a tad frosty to me back there.
Is everything okay with him?
You tried to kill him a few months back.
Were you expecting a hug?
A short memory, the key to a happy life.
Ah!
- Can I help you?
- Hi, Mrs. Marks.
My name's Jack Harper.
We're actually looking for your husband.
Is he at home?
Russell isn't speaking to the press.
I think he's made that perfectly clear.
We're not from the media.
We're with the Neighborhood Watch program.
We're actually just looking for volunteers.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
We're newlyweds.
We just moved in down the block.
I'm sure Russell would love to help out, but he's out doing last-minute shopping.
But then I'm meeting him at Saint Matthew's.
If you're looking for volunteers, church is always a good place to find people.
- She's right.
- Thanks for your advice.
- Maybe we'll see you there.
- Okay.
Good luck.
- Guess who else'll be at church tonight.
- Something tells me we should be there.
That's kind of cute.
That's nice.
I like it.
Are those the eyes?
- Santa's not coming, is he?
- Yes, he is.
He is.
It's just, you know how those reindeer can be.
- That's very nice.
- Miss Allen, you promised us.
I know.
I did.
It's just that sometimes things can happen, even to Santa.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Who do you think that is?
- Santa!
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Davis?
- No, it's Santa.
- What are you doing?
- Explain later.
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Come on, who wants to sit on Santa's lap?
Okay.
Santa wants to make sure that everyone's gone to the bathroom recently, yes?
- Yes.
- Really?
Really?
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
Are you even allowed in here?
I'm not the one screwing with the big guy's plans.
If anyone's getting struck by lightning, my money's on you.
Okay, so tell me the truth.
Why are you really helping me today?
As far as I'm concerned, as long as the dead stay dead there's no harm in giving a little help to the living.
Or maybe I just didn't want to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
There's our man.
Mr. Marks?
We don't want to cause any trouble but we're friends of the Moores, and you should know that Ann and Cambria are gonna be here today.
Look, Ann is still very angry about her sister's death.
Rather than disrupt the services, we thought we'd forewarn you.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm an innocent man.
- And I need to move on with my life.
- And what about Allison Moore's life?
- Thank you for your concern.
- Russell.
I'm gonna go enjoy the services with my wife now.
Excuse me.
Well, that went well.
I'm starting to think the jury was right about Marks.
- What makes you say that?
- If there's one thing I know, it's killers.
Once you take a human life, it's like a smell that you can't wash off no matter how hard you try.
And that guy he ain't got the funk.
Ho, ho, ho.
What would you like for Christmas?
- A ferret.
- A ferret?
Okay, I don't think I have any of those.
But have you ever considered a bone saw?
To cut wood for a really neat tree house.
- Thanks, Santa!
- Yeah.
Ho, ho.
And what about you?
What would you like for Christmas?
A bone saw.
I think I'm all out of those.
But how about a splatter guard to keep blood from splattering on your face.
- You're the coolest Santa ever.
- Thank you.
Ho, ho, ho.
And for you, there's a rib separator.
And how about some forceps.
I guess all I can do now is keep Ann Moore away from him.
Yeah, well, if that's the case, then...
Showtime.
There she is.
Come on, we're going home.
- That's it?
- Nothing happened.
- Maybe it hasn't happened yet.
- All right, we gotta split up.
One of us follows Ann, the other stays with Russell.
Okay, I'll stay with Russell.
You follow Ann.
But if anything happens to her, so help me, Jack.
Helping you is what I'm doing, Tru.
What do you mean, you can't stay?
Don't we have other things to talk about?
Hi, Dad.
- Harrison, what are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same thing.
Well, I guess you've already spoiled the surprise.
- Surprise?
- I just signed the lease.
Merry Christmas, son.
It's all yours.
What?
This place?
What is...?
I may not be able to give my new employee a raise.
But the partners can't say anything about a father giving to his son.
I've been working on this for weeks.
But you almost blew the whole thing.
- I'm sorry.
I was thinking...
- Forget it.
Forget it.
It all worked out.
Oh, wow.
- Merry Christmas, Dad.
- You too.
Jensen.
Hey, stranger.
What are you doing here?
I guess I just wanted to see what it is I've been missing out on all these years.
And pay my respects.
Who's that for?
That's for my uncle.
He died of a heart attack last year.
And that's for my cousin, who passed away when we were little kids.
You know, think about this.
If things had gone differently you might be lighting one for me.
- But things didn't go differently.
There but for the grace of Tru go I.
So who's that one for?
Nobody.
I gotta get back to the lab, so I'II...
- I'll see you later.
- Hey, Jensen Mr. Gorenstein doesn't need the company tonight.
So I say you ditch the lab and you join me and my brother for Christmas Eve dinner.
You know, in the spirit of doing something new each day.
Okay.
I'll try.
Way of doing this.
- Hello.
- All right, I followed Ann home.
She's not doing much except the crossword puzzle.
How's Marks?
On his way home.
We must have missed something.
Maybe Allison Moore's "Help me" had nothing to do with revenge.
Hold on.
Cambria!
Cambria!
Tru, I think I know who Allison wanted us to stop.
It wasn't Ann.
It was her daughter.
Do you know who I am?
Of course.
From the trial, right?
That's how you know?
Is there anything I can do for you?
You can admit what you did to my mom.
Look, Cambria, I think you should...
You think I should what?
Forgive you?
Or make you pay for what you did before you have a chance to do it to someone else?
Please, honey.
I loved your mother.
I would never have done anything to hurt her.
- No, that's not true!
- I was ready to give up everything.
My job, my marriage, just for a chance to be with her.
Cambria, do you remember me?
I'm a friend of your aunt's.
This isn't what she wants.
She's angry.
She misses your mom just like you do.
But this isn't the answer.
We don't get to decide who lives and who dies who's guilty and who's not.
That's not the way it works.
- It's out of our hands.
- You don't understand.
He killed her and got away with it.
And nothing you do here is gonna change that.
Look, it won't bring your mom back and it won't bring your aunt any more peace.
No one's gonna die tonight.
You're not even gonna hurt him.
You'll miss, and then the only one who will pay is you.
What's going on?
- My God, what is this?
- Honey, go back inside.
Something that looked like curtains with red flowers blowing in the wind.
Maybe it wasn't curtains.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I won't miss.
Okay, and if you don't, then you've just killed someone.
That's something you're gonna have to live with every day for the rest of your life.
Isn't that right, Mrs. Marks?
What's she talking about?
L...
I have no idea.
Cambria, don't make an innocent man pay for someone else's crime.
I know this is a lot to ask but hopefully you won't need to press charges.
No.
I think she's been through enough already.
You're just gonna let her go?
What about us?
Haven't we been through enough?
You're saying she should pay for trying to take your husband from you?
- Exactly.
- Just like Allison Moore, right?
You need to talk to your wife.
Russell.
I did it for us.
Don't tell me.
Tell them.
Thank you for everything you did today.
I would be more thankful if I understood how you knew to actually do it, but...
Davis.
I've been thinking about what the best thing is to give you for Christmas.
I think the best gift I can give you is...
Is the truth about my life.
What do you mean?
You know how you were asking me how I knew Santa wasn't gonna show up?
Yeah.
It's an interesting story, really.
Um...
It's one that I'm not supposed to talk about.
Davis, you know that you can tell me anything.
Yeah, I know that.
It's...
This is about Tru.
So I gotta ask, why call the cops about Mrs. Marks?
The case was closed.
Why put the family through that again?
You know how you said if there's one thing you know, it's a killer?
Well, I know victims.
I know what it's like to lose someone and not know who took them from you.
I guess I owed a girl who lost her mom.
I gotta tell you, it was cool to wear the white hat for a change.
So you're admitting that I'm the good guy?
Do you know why they gave the white hat to the hero in the Old West movies?
It made them easier to light for the camera.
The color of the hat is not about right or wrong.
It's about what you choose to see.
- Well, I'm this way.
- And I'm this way.
- So I guess I'll be seeing you.
- Until the day you quit.
Or you do.
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
It was.
Merry Christmas, Tru.
Maybe I just didn't want to spend Christmas Eve by myself.
Hey, Jack.
Okay, this doesn't mean that I've forgiven you and this changes absolutely nothing between us but I've always had this feeling that no one should be alone on Christmas Eve.
Oh, look who finally showed up.
- Hey.
- Twice in one day.
What a treat.
Relax, Harry, okay?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
What, pass up the chance to meet all your friends?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
- What was that?
If it's a call for...
- Look...
Merry Christmas, for now.
Okay?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I hope you don't mind.
I brought Moe and Curly.
Yes.
We took your advice, and we called the airlines and our flights were cancelled.
So...
We'd be spending Christmas Eve in an airport.
Uh-huh.
So Jensen is not the only one who owes you one.
It was just a hunch.
Yes.
Merry Christmas.
Hey!
Davis, I thought you guys were having your own holiday dinner.
We did.
But then Davis said that Harrison has a habit of standing you up and we didn't want you to be alone.
- Are you okay?
You never called me to see how things were with Jack.
- Oh, right.
Yeah, how did that go?
- Fine.
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
It's probably just the eggnog.
Well, we'll talk later, okay?
When are you gonna tell her that I know the secret?
No, seriously, it's got cuffs.
Right here.
We have the best dad in the freaking world.
He got me an apartment.
He got it pimped out, everything.
- Mighty generous.
- No, not generous, well earned.
Hey.
- Jack Harper.
- Hi.
Yeah, this is my dad, Richard.
Richard, Jack.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- You work with my daughter?
- A competitor, actually.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Long day?
Aren't they all?
In my endless pursuit of the holiday spirit there's one thing I haven't done yet.
- What's that?
Oh.
- Wasn't he supposed to be one of yours?
- Give it time.
And what about the mole?
She's got him.
Merry Christmas.
- I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.
There's the guy making out with my sister.
Enough with the making out.
Don't you go all guardian on me now.
Come on, guys, it's time to make a toast.
We never conceal the truth, no subject is taboo
We try to share everything with each other
This is our family rule
Good morning
Good morning
Say, where'd you cook me up?
Cook you up?
Where was I invested with life, my destiny-origination?
A love hotel
- Where?
- Wild Monkeys
Wild Monkeys?
That monkey billboard in the mall That love hotel there
And me?
Right here, Ko
Where here?
Right there
In the refrigerator?
But doesn't Wild Monkey sound like you're totally dumb?
Kimura Hana was Amsterdam
"I'd like to visit Amsterdam someday,
"I'm sure I'll feel a sense of nostalgia there," she says.
Revolting
She got made when her folks went to Amsterdam to smoke pot
Her name's Kimura Hana?
Like the flower?
They're definitely ex-hippies
Sure beats Wild Monkeys
Wish I hadn't asked I wanna die
Your mother didn't like Wild Monkeys, either, but that day, everywhere else was full
Hotel Merry-go-round, Hotel White Parasol,
Hotel Mr. Mountain Bear...
Each time they turned us down, it only stiffened our resolve
So we settled for Wild Monkeys
Great memory, but then you're an ex-class president
Of course, we're talking Wild Monkeys
Already 16 years since Wild Monkeys
And 17 years since this Grand Urban Maison was built
It's just a housing project
Shit
At least eat your egg
I'm off
I'm off
Honey, wait, take out the garbage
Sure, sure, I'm off
Off you go
Kyobashi Takashi, eriko, Mana, Ko
Wait, wait
"home remodeling is the way to go!
"Today's topic...
"Remodeling with new wallpaper is the way to go!"
Listen
About your bear...
It's pink
Yeah, it's pink
Your bear...
How can he bear it?
Are you nuts?
How can your bear bear it?
...leave a 5 yen coin under your bed, and you'll get lucky in love
Apearl of wisdom
I'll definitely check it out, starting tonight
Happy Birthday, Mommy May 18, 1991
HANGING GARDEN
For real?
Intense
That's totally intense
Right?
Isn't Kimura Hana a creep?
No, I can't believe your family discussed it first thing in the morning
It's our family rule that we don't hide anything
In the Kyobashi family, nothing's embarrassing
Wow, intense
That's so intense
No way that would happen in my family
That's because your family's grounded
What?
Your feet are on the ground
You're just dissing my family because they're farmers
I'm not dissing them Being grounded is cool
Nothing cool about it
Oh, I'd like to blow this place up
Why?
Thanks to this place we can live in the sticks, but still eat Italian, Balinese, and go to Starbucks
Don't tell me you like Discovery Mall
I'd die without Discovery Center
Totally brainwashed
Listen, Mokki
You asked me what I wanted for my birthday, right?
It's not a thing, but there is somewhere I want to go
Where?
Hurry up and tell me
That grandma over there, keeled over this morning
Hospitals are just a place to dump old women
Mother, you're smoking!
You really should shorten your skirt
You've got zero sex appeal
Is Takashi really keeping up with his work?
I mean, the man's over 40
He has to pull that silver spoon out of his mouth and get a real job, so you don't have to work
Mother, why won't you let them operate?
I can't stand it, anesthetics and all...
Why?
Why...
What, what are you doing!
I'm off, then
Wait a minute
Take this and treat Mana on her birthday
It's OK
It's not for you, for Mana
I don't need it
Treat the 3 of you on the sly, without your dumb hubby
Oh, no, pick them up
Don't leave it on the floor
If you put 5 yen coins under your bed, you get lucky in love
That's what they said on TV
Satoko san
How are we feeling today?
A melon!
Hey, my 5 yen coins!
Tempura with noodles, ready
Welcome
Sorry to keep you waiting Here are your orders
Take your time
Thank you
Ninny
Stop calling me that
Sorry, it's just, that's what my Mom calls you
What an amazing coincidence that you and Mom were in the same class, all through school
The manager says your bathroom breaks are too long
And your absentee rate's high You'll get fired
It's not like soba noodles You can't just cut off a shit
Ninny, you used to be totally depressed, right?
Mom told me all about it
Always alone and super sensitive
Always smiling to cover up Totally empty Ninny
Oops, was that supposed to be a secret?
I have no secrets
Liar, that's impossible You're so pathetic
Then, why are you smiling?
Answer me
Hey, Sacchi, more soba water
Not until after you've eaten soba
Manager, she's got a sexually transmitted disease
What?
Chlamy...dai?
Chlamydia
She says it hurts when she pees so she washes it with soba water
The poor girl
Two orders of soba water, please
Hey!
Throw out all the soba water!
Hotel Wild Monkeys
Here it is
For real
It's really here?
Let's go
Way, way... wait!
Way, wait!
Hey, wait!
Wild Monkeys, huh?
Wild Monkeys Hotel's over the top
Hey, there's karaoke
Hey, a revolving bed!
I wonder if the bathroom door really doesn't lock...
I could probably live here... lf, today, just if...
If you come inside me and it reaches my ovaries, we'd become an instant family
That's kind of intense
Actually, it's so simple, really
I'll take it off
Sorry
I can't, just can't
So tacky
Don't mind, don't mind
I want to run away
Shall we use Viagra?
I can't afford it
I'll get you some for a present on your birthday
Let's do karaoke
I want to stay here forever
"So?
"So?
"I walk with my back to the streets"
You should be ashamed of yourself
A human with no shame is no better than a monkey.
Right?
We wear clothes and don't have sex in public, because we're ashamed
Excuse me, can I get another beer?
I think morals are conceptualized shame
Why don't you smoke in non-smoking buses?
Why don't you suck on a young girl's leg?
Because you're ashamed
I'm ashamed
That's why people who have no concept of shame are so impossible
I mean, wimps like you
Yes
This is for you
What?
Do you know what today is?
What day was it?
The day you stole my virginity
Oh, right...
Can I open it?
Because I was raised in a family that couldn't remember my birthday,
I want to celebrate the day I became a woman
I'm so thrilled Thank you, thank you so much
Oh, good
I think that's all for today
I bit your nipple
a little too hard
You drew a little blood
Do it right I want you to do it right
Stop wimping out and dithering around like some stupid wimp
Stop dissing me and your wife and kids and everyone around you
Get it?
Get it?
Yes, I'm sorry
Yes?
Yes?
Yes?
Yes
Don't yes me
Bye bye
Mother
Time to go home, you Ioner
What are you doing here?
Dropped in for some snacks
I'll go buy them
Sacchi, the part-timer, started going steady with a guy and she's always just not showing up
I was late because of a thing over firing her
Lucky her, going steady with a guy
What happened to your teddy bear?
Oh, I attached him to Mokki's bag
But you were crazy about that bear
Adultery prevention
Oh, sorry, sorry
Say, seeing as I got home so late tonight, let's call a cab and grab some Balinese food at Discover
Not me, I'm busy
Then I've got homework, too
OK, well, next time, then
Listen, I really think we need 4 keys, one for each of us
But we're one family
I don't want you to come home to an empty home
I bit your nipple...
Thanks for the watch
Wear it
My house is this way
I bit your nipple
a little too hard...
My house is this way
Wear it
Mother keeps insisting she won't be anaesthetized
Lung cancer, right?
Let's do it
Surgery is her only option
Then she'll have to move hospitals and we don't have the money
But we've got love
The other day...
I looked up how much we still owe on our mortgage
I learned we still owe 30 million yen
All the payments we made these 15 years, went mostly for interest That's not fair, is it?
The world's full of unfairness
Oh, I know Mana says, she wants to go to the new sushi place in the mall for her birthday
Why not?
We'll blow 30,000 yen
Only 30,000?
When I ask Ko what he wants to do, he just says, "Whatever"
When I ask him what he wants to eat, it's "Whatever"
If that's teenage rebellion, it's sure a gutless rebellion
He's probably holding it in 30,000 yen, huh?
Better increase my hours
No, I'll pay for it
Oh, I'm really wiped Good night, turn out the lights
It's 5 years since we last did it...
Thank you, then
Kyobashi san, how's the property?
I'll have to consider the matter
A place near the mall that allows 2 mid-size dogs is a prize
Yes, you're right, but I'll take you, Mina, over the dogs
Let go of me, they'll find out You really can't
Nobody's around at this hour
What is it?
That's my son
When are you due?
One more month
So soon
You just got pregnant the other day
It'll get faster with the kids growing up
Have the baby before the rainy season
She looks so happy sleeping
Sorry, were you dreaming about getting high?
No, dreaming about not having a home, right, Ninny?
Give me a soda
You free?
Please
You're the only one I can ask, Ninny This is the last time
Pay me back
One more
I got fired from my job
Thank you So you do feel guilty
What?
For what?
Chlamydia I'll give it to you
What?
Really?
That manager, I stroked him a little and he came in a second
You've got a teenage daughter, right?
Her name's Mana, right?
It's probably too late by now
She's probably in Wild Monkeys getting fucked, from front and from behind and everywhere else
Shut the fuck up!
Say, Ninny, why do you always have that perfect smile?
To keep up the lies?
Because you're empty?
Stop!
If you stick to your story, it stops being a lie
Eriko, huh?
What about school?
Haven't been to school in a long time I just get bullied there, anyway
I'd gotten used to the bullying, but getting used to it and asking for it are different, right?
How's your family?
Mom brings men home so I can't go home, which is just a housing project
What can you do
You call her Mom, but she's just a grown up kid
Scalp a human and we're all just skulls
Not food for humans
Oh right, it's your birthday
That's why I wanted to come to my destiny-origination
We all come into this world crying
And bloody, too
Do you have a family?
Would you like to start over?
Get married, buy a house, have babies and your own...
Your family's finished
Welcome to Babylon, Queen
Start over?
It was all over a long time ago
You really are clueless, aren't you?
Really are clueless
You really like me, don't you?
Don't you like me?
You're here because you like me
You wouldn't be here if you didn't Right?
Right?
You're not lying, are you?
I'll do it myself
I'll do it myself
I think you're a really pathetic human being
Happy Birthday
Boss, my father slipped in the bathroom and hit his head twice...
I'm terribly sorry, but could I take the day off...
Oh, really?
Thank you Sorry to inconvenience you
Wimp
Wimp
I had a feeling I might run into you
I bit your nipple...
Um...
Yes
I'd like to visit your show room
Can you show me your student ID?
I'm home
Welcome home
Honey, a phone
A phone?
Won it in a bingo game for our client's new employees
Wow, amazing
I can't believe my bingo luck
Oh, she's Kitano Mina She's going to tutor Ko
Tutor Ko?
This is my Dad
Dad?
You always call him, Papa
Shut up, sis
Nice to meet you, I'm Kitano Mina Just call me Mina, Papa
Ko just brought her home, out of the blue
He saw the flyer advertising tutors in the mall, and called her up himself
He's never shown such initiative, and her monthly fee's reasonable
Even if he doesn't have exams, his grades will matter in high school
Let's eat Sit down, Papa
Please, sit down, teacher
What's that yellow car?
It's a Wimp Q
Another day, Papa
Papa, this beer's totally delicious
Oh, thanks
You, too, teacher
Why, thank you
What?
Your bank passbook?
Not again
How could you not take something so important to the hospital?
Yeah, so, where is it?
The Buddhist altar?
Hold on
Hello, mother
Hello, nice to see you
I'll bring it later
What is the purpose of a show room, teacher?
Well, the show room is for...
Cake time... is the way to go
How many times do I have to tell you to knock?
Oh, sorry, sorry
Oh, why thank you
I have to go to your grandmother's house
Take your time
Right And I'll stop by the hospital
OK?
You see, if she keeps this up, Eriko won't make it into college
Her attendance is much too low
Why don't you try getting her some counseling
I think she may be mildly depressed
An acquaintance of mine is a doctor
Why don't you consult with him?
It's all my fault
The way she turned out is all... it's all my fault
Oh, no, I don't think so
I'm so sorry, it's all my fault
Oh, no, that's not true
Please, be strong
It's not a matter of assigning blame
My marriage was all wrong
Her father was the worst sort of man!
And she takes after him
I was happy with just my older boy
I never intended to have a second child
Her older brother is such a good boy
I never should've had her I never should've had her
I never should've had that girl
I never should've had her I never should've...
Die with me!
Die with me!
Die with me!
There is just one thing
I'm hiding from my family
That the Kyobashi family was created according to my perfect plan
Mana wasn't an unexpected child
I'd kept track of my cycle since I was 15
I looked for a boy who could make a family, and staked my life on fashion and beauty to catch that boy
I also devoted 3 years of high school to studying only child rearing and home economics
Don't walk in front Don't walk in front
Don't look this way Don't look this way
Don't breathe Don't breathe
Don't wimp out, Ninny
I couldn't fit in
My classmates called me strange names, and collectively ignored me
My high school life was barren and hopelessly empty
The only place I had to go was home, and at home, I was stuck with my mother
I met Takashi when he took a part-time job at the company I joined afterfinishing high school
I observed him for one month and made my choice
Hotel Wild Monkeys
On his last day, I asked him out and he was easy, inviting me right on to the hotel
I figured he was that kind of guy, but that was hardly relevant to my plans
The crucial question, was when I told him I was pregnant, would he grudgingly accept it or run away
Takashi
I'm pregnant
Really... good...
When we moved into the housing project,
I thought I had arrived at a shimmering new future
Don't cry, now
Mana, can Mommy have some ice cream?
Mmm, yummy
Look Ko
Why's Ko crying?
Up so high, high Stopped crying
Doing the exact opposite of my detested mother
I started my new family
Mama
What's wrong?
Did you see a ghost?
Don't be scary
This area used to be a cemetery
Cut it out
Mother, are you OK?
Yes, I just spaced out a little
Seconds?
More beer, Papa?
Teacher
In our family, we share everything
Our rule is we hide absolutely nothing from each other
Right, when I got my first period, we had a party to celebrate
And we had a Celebrate Ko's Awakening to Sex Party
Sister!
Mama, tell us how you lost your virginity
Right now?
Oh, no
No secrets in our family
I'll write it up in a report later
Tell us now, with teacher here, too
When was it... not in front of Papa It was Papa, after all
That's not what you said before
Tell us
How was it, Papa?
Don't... don't ask me
Wasn't it you, Papa?
It was Papa
Of course it was Papa
I've only slept with him
That's not what I heard before...
A family without secrets is like a love hotel room with no windows
What does that mean?
Oh, I don't mean anything strange
It was just a metaphor, nothing more
And do you use them, teacher?
Of course not
I'd like to see a room with no windows
Ko, that's a fantastic seduction line You're a natural
Have you had a Caught Dad Cheating Party?
Not yet
No, no, no, no, no
No, no party like that
No, no
It's time for me to go
Thank you for the lovely meal
Oh, not at all
Sorry for not cleaning up
- See you
- Take care, then
Take care, teacher
Thanks
Going on a date, now?
Maybe that's a secret
See you, Ko
Thank you
Do your homework
See you, take care, bye bye
Honey, there's no more beer Guess I have to go buy some
No more beer...
Reeks of perfume
Ko, can you clean that up?
Do you ever get horny for your teacher?
She's got big tits
I don't get horny for her But her breasts are big
Hmmm How's the studying going?
I'm realizing what my weakness is
What's your weakness?
I get too obsessed
But it's important to be obsessed
If you really want to be beautiful, or be cool, you tend to get what you want
Even this place, I really wanted to live here, and I got to
At the time, this was the place everyone coveted
I thought, "I got what I wanted!
Now our family can be happy"
That's what I mean by obsessed
When you get obsessed, you shut out reality
Mina, I wanted to see you
You see me every week
I'll go to the store
More...
Lady, no smoking or cell phones allowed
Don't you hear me?
No smoking, look
The No Smoking sign
I'll throw you off the bus
Driver...
What a drag
I'm his guardian, Kinosaki Satoko
My grandson caused you so much trouble
How can I apologize...
What a provincial department store
Got me out of a jam, thanks, Sacchan
Not so fast
What?
I'm your guardian
Sorry, did you buy it?
Who's she?
Sacchan
I'm his guardian, Kinosaki Satoko
I thought I had money...
You got caught shoplifting?
I had to get her, she's my guardian...
Why did you bring your grandma?
It's too surreal
What does surreal mean?
Have fun with your grandma
Don't "grandma" me Want me to set your hair on fire?
When you ask a kid to shop for you, the mature thing to do is to give him enough money
How much?
How much were the tampons?
What a drag
I'm not asking for the money
Dragging a kid to a place like this What if his parents find out?
You've got parents, don't you?
No, I don't
Well, excuse the fuck out of me
Go ahead and tell his parents
Ko, why not learn how to fuck from an experienced, mature woman
Fax?
Send it where?
Teacher
Ko
Tell me the truth How far have you gone with her?
This?
This?
Or...
This?
Did you get this far?
I haven't gone anywhere
I just heard that love hotels don't have windows, so I had her bring me here
You're right, there are no windows
I'll take you to the hospital
Maybe I'll rest here
The bath looks nice and big
All right, but you have to swear not to tell Mom
No, I won't You need bus fare?
I've got it But thanks
We all come into this world crying And bloody, too
Hey, Kyobashi!
What are you doing, Mokki, running up the stairs?
Did you hear?
What?
Discovery Mall has to halt development Way to go
What?
Justice prevails, after all
Oh, and you know
You gotta stop calling me Mokki It's way too tacky
See you
I'll meet you at your new place
The Taniis from the 10th floor moved out
It's getting so lonely here
I wonder who'll move in to their place
Who'd want to move in here?
Oops
Who needs human company...
What a drag
Wow, amazing
Thanks to you
Shhh, that's a secret
But why have a party for me tonight?
Because it's your birthday
That's not what I mean
Why is your family celebrating my birthday?
We share anything with strangers but not with each other
Hello, everything's ready
Coming
Mama, you're over-frying these Maybe not...
My mother, Sacchan It's her birthday, today, too
I'm Kinosaki Satoko
This is Mina, Ko's tutor
Thank you for looking after Ko
Not at all I'm always being fed here
Where's Dad?
He's late
You should always tell him an earlier time.
He's such a pussyfoot
Oh, all right Let's start without him
I'm home!
Papa, you're late
I missed my bus
Thank you for working late
Mother, it's been a long time
Takashi, you're always the picture of fortitude and manliness
Sit down, Papa
Is wine OK, teacher?
Please
No wine for you, mother
I can have a toast
This could be my last birthday Right, Takashi?
Drink up
You're so sweet, teacher
Well, then
In honor of Mina's 22nd birthday and Sacchan's something-or-other birthday, here goes, Happy birthday to you...
Mina, Sacchan, congratulations!
Cheers
Let's eat, let's eat
Please, eat up
Dad, you seem a little down
Is it because Sacchan's here?
I know, it's a school play
This is a school play
This is exactly like a kindergarten play
They all know the truth, but they're acting like a happy family
A school play
I get it This is a school play
Teacher, are you OK?
"Teacher, are you OK?"
You're good at mimicking Ko
Right?
What's wrong with a school play?
It's fun, isn't it?
Why not be happy to be alive?
It's your birthday
Mother, I didn't know you smoked
I haven't been able to quit since 18
Can't quit
May I smoke one?
Sure, feel free
Thank you very much
Here, teacher
You said you didn't like women who smoke
I had quit...
Hotel Wild Monkeys...
Do you frequent love hotels?
Well, most days when I come here
Are you drunk, teacher?
You could get alcohol poisoning
So, the question is...
Who is with me then?
I'll go buy some beer
We've got another case
Some harder stuff, then...
After you hear the answer
No. 1, Papa
No. 2, Ko
No. 3, Sacchan
Call her a taxi
And the answer...
Really, Mama, call her a taxi
You OK?
Teacher, are you OK?
Teacher, I brought you some water Can I come in?
Are you OK?
I'm coming in
Are you OK?
You'll feel better if you throw it all up
Drink all that water up You OK?
It's acute alcohol poisoning
Turn on the TV?
I've lost my appetite
"...thing is, I don't want him to wimp out
"I totally want him not to wimp..."
What a totally stupid show, sorry
Would you read these outside?
Don't leave them in the toilet
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't done it in 5 years
Bet you've got cobwebs down there
Hey, she looks exactly like Mana
What?
Exactly like her
Idiot!
She doesn't look anything like me
I can't believe you buy these, Papa You're the worst, disgusting
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't...
Because you're cheating?
No I'm not
Oh, what's the big deal
Young people have their own rules about dating
Say, when I was talking with Ko on the phone...
Mother, I've told you not to call when I'm not here
I called her to ask her how this place used to be
The reason you thought we could all be happy living here, was because it was brimming with direct sunlight and greenery...
That's what she taught you?
What is she teaching you?
That giant-breasted teacher
Straightening your hair, getting sexy...
How about "Thanks for dinner?" Isn't that what you say?
Eriko
Ko's just impossible these days
I don't have a clue anymore
Just like an ex-class president Super mean
Ex-class president?
At this rate, Ko might become a "shut-in"
Eriko you used to be a "shut-in," too
No way
Of course not
Back then, we didn't have that nifty phrase "shut-in" yet, so you couldn't tell whether she was lazy or sick
I was not a shut-in
They'd tease you, "Ninny, Ninny," and you'd come home crying
Listen, Mother
What is it?
Why don't you just die
Maybe I'll have another glass of beer
Hello?
Is that Ninny
No, it's not
- I'll answer it
- Why?
Not sure why
Hello, Eriko san?
What do you want?
Listen, I forgot my earrings in my locker at the soba shop
Can I borrow the key?
I'll give it right back, can I come over?
Listen, you
What?
Die
Who was that?
Miss Fizz-for-brains
So many girls like that these days
I say it's time for the cake
Yeah, let's have cake
They shot this in Wild Monkeys
You know Wild Monkeys, Sacchan?
She's still very much in her prime
This does look exactly like you, Mana Look
That's why you were curious about love hotels
You do take after your father, Mana
I found a Viagra brochure in your bag
What do you do when cut school?
I eat sweets Meals with liars taste lousy
Thanks for dinner, Ninny
Taka-baby, water
Teacher, let's call you a cab Are you OK?
Taka-baby
Who's Taka-baby?
I bit your nipple...
Yes, hello?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Kinosaki Satoko Who might you be?
I'm Mr. Wimp's S-Friend
Oh, it's so nice to meet you
Mr. Wimp, your S-Friend's on the phone
Thanks
Hello, S-Friend Alva Trois
Tell me, is S-Friend French?
It means Sex Friend
Oh, I see
Brings back memories
Remember how we'd go out to celebrate birthdays?
We'd ride the bus to Sushi Tsune or Gourmet Grill?
I have no memories of going out to eat with you
Sure we did
Don't tell me, you're going senile
Maybe you should go back into therapy
Listen, Mother
Why don't you just die
There's too many candles
Too senile to remember your age?
Reminds me of funeral incense
Make your incense offering
Don't mind if I do
What...
Birthdays are for the survivors
So many people have already died on me
Those I loved, those I hated
But as time passes, you forget them
That's the saddest thing of all
When you're dying, it's as though ordinary memories, gathering dust in an empty well, quietly start to play, like in a silent movie
That's what I've been thinking
Do you remember, when you were 3 or 4, we took a ride on the ferris wheel?
You cried for ice cream, but I only had enough money to buy one
But you wouldn't even give me a bite
I kept asking you to give Mommy a bite, but you just shut up and pouted
I got pissed off and slapped you
That scene's been appearing in my dreams, lately
But each time I see it, the dream's a little different
It keeps getting better
I'm revising my memories in my dreams, improving on them
When I think I'll die in this dream,
I feel so relieved, not sure why...
Having kids is so great
When you have kids, time flows so slowly
And your life follows an orderly cycle
You get your hands on whatever you need
And then you can start over
Start over and do it again
It's your fault I couldn't go to school
Start over, do it again
A mother is supposed to love her child, affirm her child, bring her up well, protect her from hatred and evil
point out what's right and beautiful in the world, and protect her against despair and fear
That's what she's supposed to do
Start over
That's what a mother does
Creating that kind of a home is what a mother does
I don't want to keep on smiling
My smile is a prayer, to protect this family,
so we can all live happily, every day
Start over...
Do it over
You never should've become a mother
You're a failure as a mother
In my next life, when I'm reborn,
I'll be your mother and bring you up properly
So why don't you just die
Start over, do it over
Start over
Do it over
Eriko, Mom's looking much better
The reason Mom refused surgery, was because she thought, under anesthesia, she'd just blab everything
What?
She'd seen a spy movie, where the guy was afraid he'd spill, so he choose surgery without anesthesia
When the doctor assured her it wouldn't make her talk, she went right under
So, she's got secrets
You know what they are, brother?
Live life as long as she has and I'm sure she's got a secret or two
But you'd know better than me Unlike me, you two get along
What do you mean?
You've always gotten along
To this day, you're all she talks about
How you brought her flowers or plants from so-and-so...
My wife's had it up to here with it
You tell me her secret and I'll pay for the surgery
Mana?
Mom, I'm sorry, I have to stay for practice today
It's hard work making new friends with girls in high school
I might be a little late
OK, then, stick with it Just don't be too late
Bye, then
Bye, then
Yes, I'm in the tunnel
Well, the situation is, when the dog leapt out,
I swerved to avoid him and that's when I ran into it
No, nobody's injured
Teacher Mina, when they built that housing project, did they think, if all the windows were the same size and faced South at the same angle,
that they'd all get the same sunlight and everyone would be equally happy?
What are you talking about?
That's for drying laundry
See ya
No matter how late, he's always home by 10
He'll be fine
Ko's pretty together Let him go out, once in a while
He's 14 years old
Listen, Papa
If you know where Ko is, tell me
Ko's with Mina, right?
You know Mina's cell phone number
Don't play dumb, I know what's what
I'm sorry, actually, I've broken our family rule about no secrets...
I don't want to hear your ridiculous confession
Blabbing a secret isn't following the rules
I want you to not have any secrets, to protect our family!
I'll call you back
Are you listening to me?
...they were trying to steal the cash, when an officer responded to the alarm, arresting them for attempted robbery and murder
In custody are Saito Sachiko, age 20, unemployed, and Yokoyama Katsuo, 25, also unemployed
Suspect Saito had once worked at the restaurant...
You're late Find a new boyfriend?
I was at practice
Oh, I see
What's in that bag?
Nothing
Papa, are you loving Mama like you should?
I think Mom's on the edge, like she might lose it.
Something's off
She's always talking to herself, always mumbling
Like "idiot," "die," or "I'll kill you"
Something's wrong
Oh, yeah?
There's no telling what people will do if they're deprived of love
Why don't you love her, instead of hiding porn
Listen, you were both totally unexpected, but for me to quit college, give up my dream of cycling around Hokkaido, get my act together to get married, get an apartment in the housing project, hunt down a job,
always chase after the next job that's even a little bit better, swallow my pride and borrow money from my folks, and when I do stay out, always be home by morning,
with hardly a kiss from your mother these past 5 years...
But how on earth do you think I can stand, looking out for our family in our pathetic housing project, if not for love!
Right?
You're late
What'd you buy?
Ko?
No, the one that nearly died
What?
Say, I had this dream
Remember back when, you cried like a baby, saying that no one in your family ever celebrated your birthday?
That we only ever celebrated your brother's?
I had a dream exactly about that
Frankly, I never played favorites between you
Sorry, but I don't have time to listen to your stories
Oh, sorry
But the thing is, today's the 18th, right?
I wanted to reach you before midnight, so I popped my dentures in and called
Happy birthday
Did you hear me?
Happy birthday
Now I'll be able to sleep peacefully
OK, excuse me
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
What's wrong?
Where'd you cook me up?
Cook you up...
Where was I given life, my destiny-origination
Don't ask such a thing
The really important things, you take to your grave
Got that?
Sure
That's what I mean by obsessed
When you get obsessed, you shut out reality
A bite of ice cream?
Sure
Isn't it yummy, Eriko?
Hey, Mama
Hurry, Mama
Maybe she's asleep
For real?
This early?
Think Mama remembers?
Bet she's still forgotten
She always remembers our birthdays
Know what this is called?
What's it called?
A surprise birthday party
Sounds suspicious
Wish she'd wake up
She'll let us in when she wakes up
Let's wait, then
Welcome home
A worn-out road leading up a hill to anywhere
A dragonfly's missing a wing
The sun climbs overhead refusing to move
I lose my own shadow

A road leading up a hill that goes on forever
An ant carries a dragonfly wing
Without a shadow there's no forward or back
I walk down the hill
I wanted to see beyond the road on the hill but I sit down in the middle of the road
The midday sun shimmers so bright
I wait for my shadow on the road on the hill

We never conceal the truth, no subject is taboo
We try to share everything with each other
This is our family rule
Good morning
Good morning
Say, where'd you cook me up?
Cook you up?
Where was I invested with life, my destiny-origination?
A love hotel
- Where?
- Wild Monkeys
Wild Monkeys?
That monkey billboard in the mall That love hotel there
And me?
Right here, Ko
Where here?
Right there
In the refrigerator?
But doesn't Wild Monkey sound like you're totally dumb?
Kimura Hana was Amsterdam
"I'd like to visit Amsterdam someday,
"I'm sure I'll feel a sense of nostalgia there," she says.
Revolting
She got made when her folks went to Amsterdam to smoke pot
Her name's Kimura Hana?
Like the flower?
They're definitely ex-hippies
Sure beats Wild Monkeys
Wish I hadn't asked I wanna die
Your mother didn't like Wild Monkeys, either, but that day, everywhere else was full
Hotel Merry-go-round, Hotel White Parasol,
Hotel Mr. Mountain Bear...
Each time they turned us down, it only stiffened our resolve
So we settled for Wild Monkeys
Great memory, but then you're an ex-class president
Of course, we're talking Wild Monkeys
Already 16 years since Wild Monkeys
And 17 years since this Grand Urban Maison was built
It's just a housing project
Shit
At least eat your egg
I'm off
I'm off
Honey, wait, take out the garbage
Sure, sure, I'm off
Off you go
Kyobashi Takashi, Eriko, Mana, Ko
Wait, wait
"home remodeling is the way to go!
"Today's topic...
"Remodeling with new wallpaper is the way to go!"
Listen
About your bear...
It's pink
Yeah, it's pink
Your bear...
How can he bear it?
Are you nuts?
How can your bear bear it?
...leave a 5 yen coin under your bed, and you'll get lucky in love
Apearl of wisdom
I'll definitely check it out, starting tonight
Happy Birthday, Mommy May 18, 1991
HANGING GARDEN
For real?
Intense
That's totally intense
Right?
Isn't Kimura Hana a creep?
No, I can't believe your family discussed it first thing in the morning
It's our family rule that we don't hide anything
In the Kyobashi family, nothing's embarrassing
Wow, intense
That's so intense
No way that would happen in my family
That's because your family's grounded
What?
Your feet are on the ground
You're just dissing my family because they're farmers
I'm not dissing them Being grounded is cool
Nothing cool about it
Oh, I'd like to blow this place up
Why?
Thanks to this place we can live in the sticks, but still eat Italian, Balinese, and go to Starbucks
Don't tell me you like Discovery Mall
I'd die without Discovery Center
Totally brainwashed
Listen, Mokki
You asked me what I wanted for my birthday, right?
It's not a thing, but there is somewhere I want to go
Where?
Hurry up and tell me
That grandma over there, keeled over this morning
Hospitals are just a place to dump old women
Mother, you're smoking!
You really should shorten your skirt
You've got zero sex appeal
Is Takashi really keeping up with his work?
I mean, the man's over 40
He has to pull that silver spoon out of his mouth and get a real job, so you don't have to work
Mother, why won't you let them operate?
I can't stand it, anesthetics and all...
Why?
Why...
What, what are you doing!
I'm off, then
Wait a minute
Take this and treat Mana on her birthday
It's OK
It's not for you, for Mana
I don't need it
Treat the 3 of you on the sly, without your dumb hubby
Oh, no, pick them up
Don't leave it on the floor
If you put 5 yen coins under your bed, you get lucky in love
That's what they said on TV
Satoko san
How are we feeling today?
A melon!
Hey, my 5 yen coins!
Tempura with noodles, ready
Welcome
Sorry to keep you waiting Here are your orders
Take your time
Thank you
Ninny
Stop calling me that
Sorry, it's just, that's what my Mom calls you
What an amazing coincidence that you and Mom were in the same class, all through school
The manager says your bathroom breaks are too long
And your absentee rate's high You'll get fired
It's not like soba noodles You can't just cut off a shit
Ninny, you used to be totally depressed, right?
Mom told me all about it
Always alone and super sensitive
Always smiling to cover up Totally empty Ninny
Oops, was that supposed to be a secret?
I have no secrets
Liar, that's impossible You're so pathetic
Then, why are you smiling?
Answer me
Hey, Sacchi, more soba water
Not until after you've eaten soba
Manager, she's got a sexually transmitted disease
What?
Chlamy...dai?
Chlamydia
She says it hurts when she pees so she washes it with soba water
The poor girl
Two orders of soba water, please
Hey!
Throw out all the soba water!
Hotel Wild Monkeys
Here it is
For real
It's really here?
Let's go
Way, way... wait!
Way, wait!
Hey, wait!
Wild Monkeys, huh?
Wild Monkeys Hotel's over the top
Hey, there's karaoke
Hey, a revolving bed!
I wonder if the bathroom door really doesn't lock...
I could probably live here... lf, today, just if...
If you come inside me and it reaches my ovaries, we'd become an instant family
That's kind of intense
Actually, it's so simple, really
I'll take it off
Sorry
I can't, just can't
So tacky
Don't mind, don't mind
I want to run away
Shall we use Viagra?
I can't afford it
I'll get you some for a present on your birthday
Let's do karaoke
I want to stay here forever
"So?
"So?
"I walk with my back to the streets"
You should be ashamed of yourself
A human with no shame is no better than a monkey.
Right?
We wear clothes and don't have sex in public, because we're ashamed
Excuse me, can I get another beer?
I think morals are conceptualized shame
Why don't you smoke in non-smoking buses?
Why don't you suck on a young girl's leg?
Because you're ashamed
I'm ashamed
That's why people who have no concept of shame are so impossible
I mean, wimps like you
Yes
This is for you
What?
Do you know what today is?
What day was it?
The day you stole my virginity
Oh, right...
Can I open it?
Because I was raised in a family that couldn't remember my birthday,
I want to celebrate the day I became a woman
I'm so thrilled Thank you, thank you so much
Oh, good
I think that's all for today
I bit your nipple
a little too hard
You drew a little blood
Do it right I want you to do it right
Stop wimping out and dithering around like some stupid wimp
Stop dissing me and your wife and kids and everyone around you
Get it?
Get it?
Yes, I'm sorry
Yes?
Yes?
Yes?
Yes
Don't yes me
Bye bye
Mother
Time to go home, you Ioner
What are you doing here?
Dropped in for some snacks
I'll go buy them
Sacchi, the part-timer, started going steady with a guy and she's always just not showing up
I was late because of a thing over firing her
Lucky her, going steady with a guy
What happened to your teddy bear?
Oh, I attached him to Mokki's bag
But you were crazy about that bear
Adultery prevention
Oh, sorry, sorry
Say, seeing as I got home so late tonight, let's call a cab and grab some Balinese food at Discover
Not me, I'm busy
Then I've got homework, too
OK, well, next time, then
Listen, I really think we need 4 keys, one for each of us
But we're one family
I don't want you to come home to an empty home
I bit your nipple...
Thanks for the watch
Wear it
My house is this way
I bit your nipple
a little too hard...
My house is this way
Wear it
Mother keeps insisting she won't be anaesthetized
Lung cancer, right?
Let's do it
Surgery is her only option
Then she'll have to move hospitals and we don't have the money
But we've got love
The other day...
I looked up how much we still owe on our mortgage
I learned we still owe 30 million yen
All the payments we made these 15 years, went mostly for interest That's not fair, is it?
The world's full of unfairness
Oh, I know Mana says, she wants to go to the new sushi place in the mall for her birthday
Why not?
We'll blow 30,000 yen
Only 30,000?
When I ask Ko what he wants to do, he just says, "Whatever"
When I ask him what he wants to eat, it's "Whatever"
If that's teenage rebellion, it's sure a gutless rebellion
He's probably holding it in 30,000 yen, huh?
Better increase my hours
No, I'll pay for it
Oh, I'm really wiped Good night, turn out the lights
It's 5 years since we last did it...
Thank you, then
Kyobashi san, how's the property?
I'll have to consider the matter
A place near the mall that allows 2 mid-size dogs is a prize
Yes, you're right, but I'll take you, Mina, over the dogs
Let go of me, they'll find out You really can't
Nobody's around at this hour
What is it?
That's my son
When are you due?
One more month
So soon
You just got pregnant the other day
It'll get faster with the kids growing up
Have the baby before the rainy season
She looks so happy sleeping
Sorry, were you dreaming about getting high?
No, dreaming about not having a home, right, Ninny?
Give me a soda
You free?
Please
You're the only one I can ask, Ninny This is the last time
Pay me back
One more
I got fired from my job
Thank you So you do feel guilty
What?
For what?
Chlamydia I'll give it to you
What?
Really?
That manager, I stroked him a little and he came in a second
You've got a teenage daughter, right?
Her name's Mana, right?
It's probably too late by now
She's probably in Wild Monkeys getting fucked, from front and from behind and everywhere else
Shut the fuck up!
Say, Ninny, why do you always have that perfect smile?
To keep up the lies?
Because you're empty?
Stop!
If you stick to your story, it stops being a lie
Eriko, huh?
What about school?
Haven't been to school in a long time I just get bullied there, anyway
I'd gotten used to the bullying, but getting used to it and asking for it are different, right?
How's your family?
Mom brings men home so I can't go home, which is just a housing project
What can you do
You call her Mom, but she's just a grown up kid
Scalp a human and we're all just skulls
Not food for humans
Oh right, it's your birthday
That's why I wanted to come to my destiny-origination
We all come into this world crying
And bloody, too
Do you have a family?
Would you like to start over?
Get married, buy a house, have babies and your own...
Your family's finished
Welcome to Babylon, Queen
Start over?
It was all over a long time ago
You really are clueless, aren't you?
Really are clueless
You really like me, don't you?
Don't you like me?
You're here because you like me
You wouldn't be here if you didn't Right?
Right?
You're not lying, are you?
I'll do it myself
I'll do it myself
I think you're a really pathetic human being
Happy Birthday
Boss, my father slipped in the bathroom and hit his head twice...
I'm terribly sorry, but could I take the day off...
Oh, really?
Thank you Sorry to inconvenience you
Wimp
Wimp
I had a feeling I might run into you
I bit your nipple...
Um...
Yes
I'd like to visit your show room
Can you show me your student ID?
I'm home
Welcome home
Honey, a phone
A phone?
Won it in a bingo game for our client's new employees
Wow, amazing
I can't believe my bingo luck
Oh, she's Kitano Mina She's going to tutor Ko
Tutor Ko?
This is my Dad
Dad?
You always call him, Papa
Shut up, sis
Nice to meet you, I'm Kitano Mina Just call me Mina, Papa
Ko just brought her home, out of the blue
He saw the flyer advertising tutors in the mall, and called her up himself
He's never shown such initiative, and her monthly fee's reasonable
Even if he doesn't have exams, his grades will matter in high school
Let's eat Sit down, Papa
Please, sit down, teacher
What's that yellow car?
It's a Wimp Q
Another day, Papa
Papa, this beer's totally delicious
Oh, thanks
You, too, teacher
Why, thank you
What?
Your bank passbook?
Not again
How could you not take something so important to the hospital?
Yeah, so, where is it?
The Buddhist altar?
Hold on
Hello, mother
Hello, nice to see you
I'll bring it later
What is the purpose of a show room, teacher?
Well, the show room is for...
Cake time... is the way to go
How many times do I have to tell you to knock?
Oh, sorry, sorry
Oh, why thank you
I have to go to your grandmother's house
Take your time
Right And I'll stop by the hospital
OK?
You see, if she keeps this up, Eriko won't make it into college
Her attendance is much too low
Why don't you try getting her some counseling
I think she may be mildly depressed
An acquaintance of mine is a doctor
Why don't you consult with him?
It's all my fault
The way she turned out is all... it's all my fault
Oh, no, I don't think so
I'm so sorry, it's all my fault
Oh, no, that's not true
Please, be strong
It's not a matter of assigning blame
My marriage was all wrong
Her father was the worst sort of man!
And she takes after him
I was happy with just my older boy
I never intended to have a second child
Her older brother is such a good boy
I never should've had her I never should've had her
I never should've had that girl
I never should've had her I never should've...
Die with me!
Die with me!
Die with me!
There is just one thing
I'm hiding from my family
That the Kyobashi family was created according to my perfect plan
Mana wasn't an unexpected child
I'd kept track of my cycle since I was 15
I looked for a boy who could make a family, and staked my life on fashion and beauty to catch that boy
I also devoted 3 years of high school to studying only child rearing and home economics
Don't walk in front Don't walk in front
Don't look this way Don't look this way
Don't breathe Don't breathe
Don't wimp out, Ninny
I couldn't fit in
My classmates called me strange names, and collectively ignored me
My high school life was barren and hopelessly empty
The only place I had to go was home, and at home, I was stuck with my mother
I met Takashi when he took a part-time job at the company I joined after finishing high school
I observed him for one month and made my choice
Hotel Wild Monkeys
On his last day, I asked him out and he was easy, inviting me right on to the hotel
I figured he was that kind of guy, but that was hardly relevant to my plans
The crucial question, was when I told him I was pregnant, would he grudgingly accept it or run away
Takashi
I'm pregnant
Really... good...
When we moved into the housing project,
I thought I had arrived at a shimmering new future
Don't cry, now
Mana, can Mommy have some ice cream?
Mmm, yummy
Look Ko
Why's Ko crying?
Up so high, high Stopped crying
Doing the exact opposite of my detested mother
I started my new family
Mama
What's wrong?
Did you see a ghost?
Don't be scary
This area used to be a cemetery
Cut it out
Mother, are you OK?
Yes, I just spaced out a little
Seconds?
More beer, Papa?
Teacher
In our family, we share everything
Our rule is we hide absolutely nothing from each other
Right, when I got my first period, we had a party to celebrate
And we had a Celebrate Ko's Awakening to Sex Party
Sister!
Mama, tell us how you lost your virginity
Right now?
Oh, no
No secrets in our family
I'll write it up in a report later
Tell us now, with teacher here, too
When was it... not in front of Papa It was Papa, after all
That's not what you said before
Tell us
How was it, Papa?
Don't... don't ask me
Wasn't it you, Papa?
It was Papa
Of course it was Papa
I've only slept with him
That's not what I heard before...
A family without secrets is like a love hotel room with no windows
What does that mean?
Oh, I don't mean anything strange
It was just a metaphor, nothing more
And do you use them, teacher?
Of course not
I'd like to see a room with no windows
Ko, that's a fantastic seduction line You're a natural
Have you had a Caught Dad Cheating Party?
Not yet
No, no, no, no, no
No, no party like that
No, no
It's time for me to go
Thank you for the lovely meal
Oh, not at all
Sorry for not cleaning up
- See you
- Take care, then
Take care, teacher
Thanks
Going on a date, now?
Maybe that's a secret
See you, Ko
Thank you
Do your homework
See you, take care, bye bye
Honey, there's no more beer Guess I have to go buy some
No more beer...
Reeks of perfume
Ko, can you clean that up?
Do you ever get horny for your teacher?
She's got big tits
I don't get horny for her But her breasts are big
Hmmm How's the studying going?
I'm realizing what my weakness is
What's your weakness?
I get too obsessed
But it's important to be obsessed
If you really want to be beautiful, or be cool, you tend to get what you want
Even this place, I really wanted to live here, and I got to
At the time, this was the place everyone coveted
I thought, "I got what I wanted!
Now our family can be happy"
That's what I mean by obsessed
When you get obsessed, you shut out reality
Mina, I wanted to see you
You see me every week
I'll go to the store
More...
Lady, no smoking or cell phones allowed
Don't you hear me?
No smoking, look
The No Smoking sign
I'll throw you off the bus
Driver...
What a drag
I'm his guardian, Kinosaki Satoko
My grandson caused you so much trouble
How can I apologize...
What a provincial department store
Got me out of a jam, thanks, Sacchan
Not so fast
What?
I'm your guardian
Sorry, did you buy it?
Who's she?
Sacchan
I'm his guardian, Kinosaki Satoko
I thought I had money...
You got caught shoplifting?
I had to get her, she's my guardian...
Why did you bring your grandma?
It's too surreal
What does surreal mean?
Have fun with your grandma
Don't "grandma" me Want me to set your hair on fire?
When you ask a kid to shop for you, the mature thing to do is to give him enough money
How much?
How much were the tampons?
What a drag
I'm not asking for the money
Dragging a kid to a place like this What if his parents find out?
You've got parents, don't you?
No, I don't
Well, excuse the fuck out of me
Go ahead and tell his parents
Ko, why not learn how to fuck from an experienced, mature woman
Fax?
Send it where?
Teacher
Ko
Tell me the truth How far have you gone with her?
This?
This?
Or...
This?
Did you get this far?
I haven't gone anywhere
I just heard that love hotels don't have windows, so I had her bring me here
You're right, there are no windows
I'll take you to the hospital
Maybe I'll rest here
The bath looks nice and big
All right, but you have to swear not to tell Mom
No, I won't You need bus fare?
I've got it But thanks
We all come into this world crying And bloody, too
Hey, Kyobashi!
What are you doing, Mokki, running up the stairs?
Did you hear?
What?
Discovery Mall has to halt development Way to go
What?
Justice prevails, after all
Oh, and you know
You gotta stop calling me Mokki It's way too tacky
See you
I'll meet you at your new place
The Taniis from the 10th floor moved out
It's getting so lonely here
I wonder who'll move in to their place
Who'd want to move in here?
Oops
Who needs human company...
What a drag
Wow, amazing
Thanks to you
Shhh, that's a secret
But why have a party for me tonight?
Because it's your birthday
That's not what I mean
Why is your family celebrating my birthday?
We share anything with strangers but not with each other
Hello, everything's ready
Coming
Mama, you're over-frying these Maybe not...
My mother, Sacchan It's her birthday, today, too
I'm Kinosaki Satoko
This is Mina, Ko's tutor
Thank you for looking after Ko
Not at all I'm always being fed here
Where's Dad?
He's late
You should always tell him an earlier time.
He's such a pussyfoot
Oh, all right Let's start without him
I'm home!
Papa, you're late
I missed my bus
Thank you for working late
Mother, it's been a long time
Takashi, you're always the picture of fortitude and manliness
Sit down, Papa
Is wine OK, teacher?
Please
No wine for you, mother
I can have a toast
This could be my last birthday Right, Takashi?
Drink up
You're so sweet, teacher
Well, then
In honor of Mina's 22nd birthday and Sacchan's something-or-other birthday, here goes, Happy birthday to you...
Mina, Sacchan, congratulations!
Cheers
Let's eat, let's eat
Please, eat up
Dad, you seem a little down
Is it because Sacchan's here?
I know, it's a school play
This is a school play
This is exactly like a kindergarten play
They all know the truth, but they're acting like a happy family
A school play
I get it This is a school play
Teacher, are you OK?
"Teacher, are you OK?"
You're good at mimicking Ko
Right?
What's wrong with a school play?
It's fun, isn't it?
Why not be happy to be alive?
It's your birthday
Mother, I didn't know you smoked
I haven't been able to quit since 18
Can't quit
May I smoke one?
Sure, feel free
Thank you very much
Here, teacher
You said you didn't like women who smoke
I had quit...
Hotel Wild Monkeys...
Do you frequent love hotels?
Well, most days when I come here
Are you drunk, teacher?
You could get alcohol poisoning
So, the question is...
Who is with me then?
I'll go buy some beer
We've got another case
Some harder stuff, then...
After you hear the answer
No. 1, Papa
No. 2, Ko
No. 3, Sacchan
Call her a taxi
And the answer...
Really, Mama, call her a taxi
You OK?
Teacher, are you OK?
Teacher, I brought you some water Can I come in?
Are you OK?
I'm coming in
Are you OK?
You'll feel better if you throw it all up
Drink all that water up You OK?
It's acute alcohol poisoning
Turn on the TV?
I've lost my appetite
"...thing is, I don't want him to wimp out
"I totally want him not to wimp..."
What a totally stupid show, sorry
Would you read these outside?
Don't leave them in the toilet
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't done it in 5 years
Bet you've got cobwebs down there
Hey, she looks exactly like Mana
What?
Exactly like her
Idiot!
She doesn't look anything like me
I can't believe you buy these, Papa You're the worst, disgusting
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't...
Because you're cheating?
No I'm not
Oh, what's the big deal
Young people have their own rules about dating
Say, when I was talking with Ko on the phone...
Mother, I've told you not to call when I'm not here
I called her to ask her how this place used to be
The reason you thought we could all be happy living here, was because it was brimming with direct sunlight and greenery...
That's what she taught you?
What is she teaching you?
That giant-breasted teacher
Straightening your hair, getting sexy...
How about "Thanks for dinner?" Isn't that what you say?
Eriko
Ko's just impossible these days
I don't have a clue anymore
Just like an ex-class president Super mean
Ex-class president?
At this rate, Ko might become a "shut-in"
Eriko you used to be a "shut-in," too
No way
Of course not
Back then, we didn't have that nifty phrase "shut-in" yet, so you couldn't tell whether she was lazy or sick
I was not a shut-in
They'd tease you, "Ninny, Ninny," and you'd come home crying
Listen, Mother
What is it?
Why don't you just die
Maybe I'll have another glass of beer
Hello?
Is that Ninny
No, it's not
- I'll answer it
- Why?
Not sure why
Hello, Eriko san?
What do you want?
Listen, I forgot my earrings in my locker at the soba shop
Can I borrow the key?
I'll give it right back, can I come over?
Listen, you
What?
Die
Who was that?
Miss Fizz-for-brains
So many girls like that these days
I say it's time for the cake
Yeah, let's have cake
They shot this in Wild Monkeys
You know Wild Monkeys, Sacchan?
She's still very much in her prime
This does look exactly like you, Mana Look
That's why you were curious about love hotels
You do take after your father, Mana
I found a Viagra brochure in your bag
What do you do when cut school?
I eat sweets Meals with liars taste lousy
Thanks for dinner, Ninny
Taka-baby, water
Teacher, let's call you a cab Are you OK?
Taka-baby
Who's Taka-baby?
I bit your nipple...
Yes, hello?
Who the hell are you?
I'm Kinosaki Satoko Who might you be?
I'm Mr. Wimp's S-Friend
Oh, it's so nice to meet you
Mr. Wimp, your S-Friend's on the phone
Thanks
Hello, S-Friend Alva Trois
Tell me, is S-Friend French?
It means Sex Friend
Oh, I see
Brings back memories
Remember how we'd go out to celebrate birthdays?
We'd ride the bus to Sushi Tsune or Gourmet Grill?
I have no memories of going out to eat with you
Sure we did
Don't tell me, you're going senile
Maybe you should go back into therapy
Listen, Mother
Why don't you just die
There's too many candles
Too senile to remember your age?
Reminds me of funeral incense
Make your incense offering
Don't mind if I do
What...
Birthdays are for the survivors
So many people have already died on me
Those I loved, those I hated
But as time passes, you forget them
That's the saddest thing of all
When you're dying, it's as though ordinary memories, gathering dust in an empty well, quietly start to play, like in a silent movie
That's what I've been thinking
Do you remember, when you were 3 or 4, we took a ride on the ferris wheel?
You cried for ice cream, but I only had enough money to buy one
But you wouldn't even give me a bite
I kept asking you to give Mommy a bite, but you just shut up and pouted
I got pissed off and slapped you
That scene's been appearing in my dreams, lately
But each time I see it, the dream's a little different
It keeps getting better
I'm revising my memories in my dreams, improving on them
When I think I'll die in this dream,
I feel so relieved, not sure why...
Having kids is so great
When you have kids, time flows so slowly
And your life follows an orderly cycle
You get your hands on whatever you need
And then you can start over
Start over and do it again
It's your fault I couldn't go to school
Start over, do it again
A mother is supposed to love her child, affirm her child, bring her up well, protect her from hatred and evil
point out what's right and beautiful in the world, and protect her against despair and fear
That's what she's supposed to do
Start over
That's what a mother does
Creating that kind of a home is what a mother does
I don't want to keep on smiling
My smile is a prayer, to protect this family,
so we can all live happily, every day
Start over...
Do it over
You never should've become a mother
You're a failure as a mother
In my next life, when I'm reborn,
I'll be your mother and bring you up properly
So why don't you just die
Start over, do it over
Start over
Do it over
Eriko, Mom's looking much better
The reason Mom refused surgery, was because she thought, under anesthesia, she'd just blab everything
What?
She'd seen a spy movie, where the guy was afraid he'd spill, so he choose surgery without anesthesia
When the doctor assured her it wouldn't make her talk, she went right under
So, she's got secrets
You know what they are, brother?
Live life as long as she has and I'm sure she's got a secret or two
But you'd know better than me Unlike me, you two get along
What do you mean?
You've always gotten along
To this day, you're all she talks about
How you brought her flowers or plants from so-and-so...
My wife's had it up to here with it
You tell me her secret and I'll pay for the surgery
Mana?
Mom, I'm sorry, I have to stay for practice today
It's hard work making new friends with girls in high school
I might be a little late
OK, then, stick with it Just don't be too late
Bye, then
Bye, then
Yes, I'm in the tunnel
Well, the situation is, when the dog leapt out,
I swerved to avoid him and that's when I ran into it
No, nobody's injured
Teacher Mina, when they built that housing project, did they think, if all the windows were the same size and faced South at the same angle,
that they'd all get the same sunlight and everyone would be equally happy?
What are you talking about?
That's for drying laundry
See ya
No matter how late, he's always home by 10
He'll be fine
Ko's pretty together Let him go out, once in a while
He's 14 years old
Listen, Papa
If you know where Ko is, tell me
Ko's with Mina, right?
You know Mina's cell phone number
Don't play dumb, I know what's what
I'm sorry, actually, I've broken our family rule about no secrets...
I don't want to hear your ridiculous confession
Blabbing a secret isn't following the rules
I want you to not have any secrets, to protect our family!
I'll call you back
Are you listening to me?
...they were trying to steal the cash, when an officer responded to the alarm, arresting them for attempted robbery and murder
In custody are Saito Sachiko, age 20, unemployed, and Yokoyama Katsuo, 25, also unemployed
Suspect Saito had once worked at the restaurant...
You're late Find a new boyfriend?
I was at practice
Oh, I see
What's in that bag?
Nothing
Papa, are you loving Mama like you should?
I think Mom's on the edge, like she might lose it.
Something's off
She's always talking to herself, always mumbling
Like "idiot," "die," or "I'll kill you"
Something's wrong
Oh, yeah?
There's no telling what people will do if they're deprived of love
Why don't you love her, instead of hiding porn
Listen, you were both totally unexpected, but for me to quit college, give up my dream of cycling around Hokkaido, get my act together to get married, get an apartment in the housing project, hunt down a job,
always chase after the next job that's even a little bit better, swallow my pride and borrow money from my folks, and when I do stay out, always be home by morning,
with hardly a kiss from your mother these past 5 years...
But how on earth do you think I can stand, looking out for our family in our pathetic housing project, if not for love!
Right?
You're late
What'd you buy?
Ko?
No, the one that nearly died
What?
Say, I had this dream
Remember back when, you cried like a baby, saying that no one in your family ever celebrated your birthday?
That we only ever celebrated your brother's?
I had a dream exactly about that
Frankly, I never played favorites between you
Sorry, but I don't have time to listen to your stories
Oh, sorry
But the thing is, today's the 18th, right?
I wanted to reach you before midnight, so I popped my dentures in and called
Happy birthday
Did you hear me?
Happy birthday
Now I'll be able to sleep peacefully
OK, excuse me
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
What's wrong?
Where'd you cook me up?
Cook you up...
Where was I given life, my destiny-origination
Don't ask such a thing
The really important things, you take to your grave
Got that?
Sure
That's what I mean by obsessed
When you get obsessed, you shut out reality
A bite of ice cream?
Sure
Isn't it yummy, Eriko?
Hey, Mama
Hurry, Mama
Maybe she's asleep
For real?
This early?
Think Mama remembers?
Bet she's still forgotten
She always remembers our birthdays
Know what this is called?
What's it called?
A surprise birthday party
Sounds suspicious
Wish she'd wake up
She'll let us in when she wakes up
Let's wait, then
Welcome home
A worn-out road leading up a hill to anywhere
A dragonfly's missing a wing
The sun climbs overhead refusing to move
I lose my own shadow

Michiyo Okusu
A road leading up a hill that goes on forever
An ant carries a dragonfly wing
Without a shadow there's no forward or back
I walk down the hill
I wanted to see beyond the road on the hill but I sit down in the middle of the road
The midday sun shimmers so bright
I wait for my shadow on the road on the hill

Covering parties everyday.
Returning home late in the night.
Writing about those parties in the morning.
I get tired.
But I am happy.
I always wanted to become a journalist.
How will you stay alone in Mumbai?
Mother has stopped me while I left Bangalore.
But papa supported me.
She is not a kid now, don't worry about our sweetheart.

Okay.. you were in that party, isn't it?
Yes. I had a drink by mistake.
But I am fine now.
Doesn't matter.
Come on.
Sit down.
Okay.
So you have come from Delhi.
To become a film star.
Yes, therefore secretary Tiwari..
..had taken me to meet some producer.
I don't know where he disappeared to.
And even I got lost.
Where do you stay?
Malad (E), with my uncle.
But I am searching for a new place now.
It is late in the nights many a times.
The society people have a problem with that.
What do you do?
I am a journalist.
Nation Today?
- lt's been six months now.
It's nice.
You should feel it..
Hello..
- Hi!
Madam.. whose party was it today?
Some nrl.
Hiren Sanghvi or something.
One more non reliable Indian.
I have never heard his name before.
Therefore, the party.
- Oh, I see.
He wants to become a page 3 regular?
Jokers!
Hey.. will you have some wine?
I got some nice French wine.
No..
I already had two glasses in the party.
And I don't want to become a habitual drinker.
And I have to go to the office tomorrow too.
You know, something, Mads.
Ever since you have shifted here..
..one thing is very clear.
- What?
We air hostesses have a better life than journalists.
How is that?
You work from seven in the morning..
..till two thirty in the night.
The things..
..that you are interested in, you must..
..not be getting time for all that.
Look at these lives, rocking lives..
You see them on the TV, isn't it?
I see this everyday.
Live..
Anyway.. good night.
Good night, boring.
Did you see Madhavi?
- She hasn't joined six months ago.
And she is arguing with the editor.
Forget it, buddy.
Who is this painter?
Who knows this man?
And you spent five hundred words for him.
Because he has spent his whole life painting.
Sir, I know these painters.
They will make a circle, and put a dot in it.
They will say that it is a woman's face.
Sir, that's because zero symbolises life.
His life!
If it was me, I would have used not more than 250 words.
I would have printed his photo too.
If there was some minister or film star in his exhibition.
See, Madhavi.
Write about the rich and famous lifestyle..
..for our readers.
Not about some loser painter.
Whose achievements are zero.
Then, what are the achievements of nrl Hiren Sanghvi?
You want to know about his achievements?
Yes.
He has bought this page with his own money.
But..
Hello.
Yes, I am coming.
Madhavi Sharma.
Page 22, distinction in Mass Communication.
So such a brilliant student, are you happy doing page 3?
Absolutely, sir.
Because, through this..
I get a chance..
..to write about some deserving people too.
But I have to fight a lot with you too.
But from now, write about those people..
..who have a lot of zeros in their life.
But on their cheque books.
Okay, sir.
No, Chetu.
I swear..
Listen to me..
Don't go by any gossip papers.
I don't have an affair with any actor.
Okay?
You are the only one in my life.
Now concentrate on your cricket, okay?
Take care.
Bye..

Abhijeet.. how do you handle your boyfriend?
I don't have any boy friend till now.
But I am looking out for one.
Your boy friend is in London since three weeks, isn't it?

So, coming back to this Swamiji.
You treat your husband like a dog.
Really.

Otherwise, he'll run away with some slimy bitch.
Zulfi. I have heard that you are..
..designing a lot for the MPs in Delhi.
I really made lovely outfits for the party meeting.
And they all loved it.
Why don't you do a favour to me?
What?
Why don't you design something for me too?

So irritating.
You will get all kinds of characters here.
Some people embrace as if..
..they are separated siblings.
So what if they don't even know..
..each others names?
- l know.
And some people meet the celebrities..
..right at the time when their photos are being clicked.
With them, their photos are clicked too.
And yes, the most important.
Whether anyone likes them or not..
..every one is good friends with the media.
Means?
- Nothing about you.
Generally.
Yeah, right.
Anyway. it was nice meeting you, Tarun.
I will see you around.
- Yeah, sure.
Bye, bye.
- Bye,
There are so many people who..
my security agency..
Oh, that's cool.

Listen.. keep this money and bring..
..some hot and spicy chicken and fish steaks.
Okay?
Give some nice service here.
- Yes, sir.
- Keep it up.
When should I come?
Why don't you do something for her in Delhi?
Snehal, when are you coming to Delhi?
All this phones and all are a setting.
Suppose that I am driving the car..
..and there is a call for the employer in the back seat.
And he says..
Hello.. yeah..
yeah.. yeah..
Yeah.. ..yeah, I am coming in the night.
Love you, bye.
It is confirmed that it is the wife's call.
He is correct!
Now, suppose there is something about transaction.
What does a transaction mean?
- Business matters.
- Okay.
Means.. hawala..
lakhs and crores..
Understand.
- Yes.
Yes, if he talks more to him..
..I mean.. a long conversation..
..means..
Yeah.. baby.. yeah..
baby.. yeah.. baby..
..yeah..
I love you, baby.. yeah..
Understand..
There is something amiss.
The overtime is confirmed today.
Wow!
Perfect!
They think that we don't know English.
These people are crazy,
So what if Bosco is a sixth grade fail?
Bosco knows English, understood?
It is nothing.
My boss is so foolish.
is it?
Why?
- Nothing.
Before going inside a party..
..he takes fifty rounds around..
..the hotel and calls up and asks..
..who has arrived?
Who has arrived?
Why does he do like this?
- Nothing.
He thinks that he will be as pricey as he arrives late.
Forget that.
My previous employer, Mr. Kishen.
He was something different.
He used to keep five pairs of clothes in the car.
He used to move around in the car.
He would attend all the parties.
He would change the clothes in the car.
And he didn't give me any over time too.
All this are the big matters of the big people.
In a nutshell..
The one who is successful..
..he has a candle by his butt.
- He is correct.
What are you talking about, Pramod?
The Saxena fluctuates every other day.
Thousands and crores of capital..
..is being eroded just being stagnant.
I think we should have patience.
Patience..
See, it takes time to take the..
..advantage of each and every policy.
But till then all small and middle..
..scale industries will be wiped out.
Thanks to MPs like you, Mr. Tyagi.
See, I am just the member of the parliament.
Personally..
I don't make any policy.
We will leave in some time.
- Hi!
Oh, hi!
Gayatri.
How are you?
I am okay.
How are you?
- Okay.
- Who are you with?
My secretary brought me here.
Okay, did you get a place to stay?
No. I am looking for work and a place to stay.
Do one thing.. why don't you..
..give me a call next week or something?
Yes?
- Yes.
Okay.
- Okay?
- Thanks.
Bye.
- Take care.
Friend, make me an EP in some film.
She is a page three journalist.
Hi..
- Hi..
How are you?
- l am fine..
How are you, Sheetal?
- l am fine.
Kedar, tell me.
Why do they air kiss?
To know the breed of everyone.
What are you saying?
- Yes.
Okay, don't forget the 21 st okay?
My 'Karva Chauth' party?
You are coming there, isn't it?
- Of course.
We will love to be there.
Thank you.
- Bye..
Bye..
- Bye..
Oh my god, what is she wearing?
Oh god!
So middle class.
She has got money, but not style.
'Karva Chauth' party?
Can you believe that?
Whatever party I go to, they are there in every party.
Goa is great.
The beaches are beautiful.
The food is great, the best sea food you ever had.
Take great care of them, okay?
They are my special guests.
- Okay sir.
It was so beautiful.
I have been there so many times..
- Really, you have been there?
Rhea..
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Put that away right now.
I think she is totally smashed.
Mom.
Just take a chill pill.
Don't worry, aunty. I will take care of her.
Control her, Anjali.
Right, anyway, back to my Vaishnodevi trip..
..you know, before I went to Paris..
..it was lots of fun, lots of friends..
..and I was just screaming..
Hail to the Goddess!
Who she?
Do you know?
Even Anjali is a social worker like Mrs. Bhavi?
What else will she do if not social work?
The husband neglects her, and the daughter doesn't listen.
Poor thing.
- Why didn't you remarry?
See..
I have married twice and divorced.
I have money and independence.
My son has grown up, why do I need a husband?
Excuse me.
Hello?
Yes..
where are you?
How are you?
- l noticed you in yesterday's party too.
Yes, even I noticed you.
Oh!
This is so beautiful.
Hi..
- Hi..
Can I drop you somewhere?
Are you sure, I have friends..
The car is small, but all you can come in.
Shall we go?
Come on in.
- Okay, thank you.
Good morning.
- Morning.
Thank god, it's Sunday.
A journalist has no Sunday in their life.
Pearl.. what's your problem?
I have lots of problems.
Look at me.
I am 27 years old.
Slim, sexy and intelligent, but single.
Look at me.
I have had three and a half affairs..
..and I have been heartbroken three times.
Three and a half affairs?
I didn't quite understand this funda.
Three reached the bed room.
The fourth ended in the hall itself.
Pearl..
You won't change.
Mad..
Mad.. you are my last hope.
Hey, what can I do?
What do you mean, what can you do?
You go to such fancy parties everyday.
You meet the rich and famous.
You cannot search one millionaire for me?
Don't you get rich and famous people in your flights?
I have kept that option open too.
But I am sick of these flights.
Sir.. can I get you some tea or coffee?
Ma'am.. can I serve you?
Now. I just want.. some servants of my own.
They should come to me and tell me..
..madam, how can I serve you?
What can I get you?
And I want one millionaire for that.
Will you help me?
I will try.
You come to the parties with me.
Hi..
- Hi, Madhavi, how are you?
I am fine, how are you?
Good..
good.
- Come inside.
Did you have any problems in searching the building?
No.. the autos of Mumbai are smart.
He brought me to the right place.
Great.
Come meet Pearl.
Pearl, this is Gayatri.
The one whom I told you about.
That girl in the train.
She's gonna share our place.
Hi..
- Hi.
Gayatri is from Delhi.
She has learnt acting from some Mohit Sharma.
And Kathak from Pt.
Sunder Maharaj.
- Why?
Obviously, Pearl.
Because she wants to become an actress.
Why do you need to learn kathak to work in films?
Fill the form for Miss India, miss world..
Straight ticket to bollywood, babe.
Pearl.. please..
Whatever..
I am going for a shower.
Don't mind.
She talks a lot, but she is good at heart.
Come in. I will show you your room.
Did you see that, Raghu?
Nobody is asking for more tea today.
Why?
- The owner of the paper has come.
Everyone has sniffed a snake.
Understood.
Sir has come.
- l understand.
Good day, everybody.
Please sit down and keep working.
Madhavi, any idea why he came?
What do I know?
Guys, I have news for you.
We did good.
- That's great.
The popularity of the page three increased such..
..that they are increasing the number of pages.
How many pages, sir?
- Easy.. easy..
We need more spicy stories and more celebrity interviews.
There aren't that many celebrities in the society, sir.
Create them.
Create them, and then destroy them.
If you make the whole paper a page 3..
..then what about our social responsibilities?
- True.
I don't make management decisions.
I just work here.
Okay, another piece of good news.
- What's that?
For these extra pages, nobody gets paid extra.
That's not fair.
- l know..
And come what may..
I need three to four celebrity interviews everyday.
Madhavi, are you listening?
Rohit, not like this.
If you hold the gun like this, it will seem real, not fake.
I had done an encounter in Panvel..
..with this shot and from this distance.
If you try the shot like this, it will be okayed.
Okay.
What is your ACP doing in the shooting?
What can I tell you?
He goes to the parties in the night..
..and trains the heroes during the day.
Why don't you write in your papers about him?
Joe.. take the shot here.
Ready, Chintu?
- Order.
Sir.
Clap!
26 by four.. take..
- Just a minute.
Mr. Rao, just a minute.
Mr. Vishnu, please come here.

Okay.
Great shot.
Very good.

Brilliant.
Very nice Rohit.
Mind blowing, Rohit, excellent.
It really seemed realistic.
- Oh, hi, Madhavi.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
- Good.
That's Madhavi from..
Of course I know her.
Her newspaper prints about me.
We have to print it.
You are in every party, isn't it?
Rohit, can we do the interview please?
Madhavi, the interview will be later.

Yeah, that's it..
That's the spirit.
That's it.
Okay, tell me.
Why were you doing an underwear ad?
You know..
Every game has its rules.
And I am not the son of some rich father.
I have to do something to survive.
But you see..
I will make it.
What about you?

My dad is an ex army officer.

You have given a lot of freedom to Rhea.

I don't know..
I don't like all this.
Come on, Anjali.
What's your problem?
She is young, let her enjoy her life.
Yeah..
I know but..
There has to be some limit..
Come on, Anjali, drop it, okay.
Okay. I have signed the cheque for your Children's home.

Can't I have a choice?
See, Abhijeet.. however and whatever you are..

Thanks, Madhavi. I will leave now.
Don't be silly.
Where will you so late in the night?
And you aren't well too.
Why don't you stay here?
No, Madhavi. lt won't seem good.
Your flatmates will have a problem.
My flat mates won't have any problems.
They are very understanding, okay?
Wait here for the night, have some rest.. sorry.
Sorry..
I will get something to eat.
Such a boring flight, I was bored.
I am at home.
Talk to you later.
Hey, Mads..
Mads.. what's up?
Mads..
I didn't know you had company last night..
Keep it up, India.. keep up.
Pearl.. that's Abhijeet.
My friend.
Who is this Abhijeet?
- The makeup man.
You mean..
Abhijeet..
Yes, that's him.
You are so boring and so same..
So sweet.
Make some tea for me.. please..
You won't change.
Mr. Charu will meet tomorrow?
Okay, please give him the message.
Gayatri Sachdeva.
No..
Not Savitri, Gayatri.
G..
G for God.
Please..
What is the matter, Gayatri?
You didn't go to the dance class today?
No.. that film maker..
Charu Mohanty.
I am trying his number since four days.
Every time they say, he is in the bath or in a meeting.
I don't understand.
When do they make films?
You come with me.
Where?
This is Bombay.
Nothing is done without contacts here.
Please let us have this interview.
We have come all the way from Kanpur once again.
We will have the interview.
Please don't worry.
Have the tea.. have it..
- Mr. Jhulka..
Oh, Miss Madhavi.. come on.
He is waiting for you.
- Thanks.
Come.. come.
Mr. Jhulka..
- Yes, when is the meeting scheduled?
Mr. Mishra.
- Yes?
- Did you see the English newspaper?
Even though this Hindi newspaper has double the circulation.
Anyways.. have the tea.
Mr. Rohit. I have seen every of your movie.
I am a huge fan of yours.
Thanks.
Rohit, you have to do something to help her.
Of course, Madhavi.
Of course.
I have worked with Mr. Charu actually.
Gayatri..
- Sorry.
Tell me.
Why do you want to start your career..
..from Mr. Charu's serious cinema?
Because I don't want to dance around trees in the name of acting.
So you want to do performance oriented rules?
Good.
We have something in common.
Mr. Jhulka!
Sir..
There is a new girl, her name is Gayatri.
She has been recommended by Rit Kumar. I have auditioned her.
She gives perfect expression.
And sir, she has a great dialogue delivery.
Sir, she is perfect for Santhalika in our next film..
..and she is promising too.
What should I do, sir?
Will she give?
Call her.
Sir, the article has come from Delhi.
There are just some corrections in it.
Yes, I will email it tonight, sir.
Bye..
Gayatri, how was your meeting with Charu Mohanty?
Where is she going?
No, Rohit.
How did he do this?
Gayatri had gone with your reference to meet him.
I know.
Do you know what a state she is in right now?
And this Charu Mohanty talks a lot..
..in his films about female liberation and all that.
This is not done, please.
You have to do something.
Okay, fine.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
Forget it, Gayatri.
Please.
Rohit Kumar has apologized personally.
He said that he will definitely..
- Forget your drama.
Didn't I tell you that she should fill the Miss India form?
Pearl, please.. what are you saying?
Pearl please.. what?
One has to compromise in Bollywood.
Pearl.
There are good and bad people in every field.
If she gets one bad person, is the whole industry rotten?
It depends on an individual, whether..
..they want to compromise and move ahead, or with hard work.
It isn't about good or bad.
It's business.
Give and take.
I cannot believe that you are being so cynical.
I am not being cynical.
I am being practical.
Don't be foolish.
- Me..
- Can't you be sensitive to our friend?
I am being foolish?
- Of course.
Instead of consoling her, you should be telling her to be strong, damn it.
Yes. I know. I know.
But the next time..
..we will cover your wife's candle exhibition very well.
Absolutely.
Someone from the office will call you.
Right sir, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Yes, tell me, Nandu.
See, your crime reporter..
What is his name?
Vinayak Mane.
He is writing anything about our MLA.
Call him back.
But he is in Nashik for a holiday.
That is the election spot of our MLA.
Actually..
If our workers get angry once..
then..
- Get up.
Who me?
Yes, get up.
We have printed just one story of Vinayak Mane.
If we print the whole story..
..your MLA will have to leave the election area.
Did you have your tea?
- Yes.
Get lost.
Did you read Vinayak Mane's MLA story?
Excellent.
Has he gone to Nashik..
..on a holiday, or did he go to search for a scoop?
Can he ever sit silently?
- Yes, that is correct too.
Hey, Kedar.
Are you going to Tejani's happening party?
The one in the town.
Yes. I am thinking which hero to be.
- Why?
The theme is very strange.
Bollywood night.
Bollywood..
Bollywood night..
They have different styles and attitudes.
Even then.. the world bows to their attitudes.
Very filmi.. very filmi..
Very filmi.. very filmi..
Very filmi.. very filmi..
Very filmi.. very filmi..
Very filmi.. very filmi..
See, Shah Rukh Khan and Devdas have arrived.
See, she has come as Umrao Jaan.
Lagaan's Aamir Khan has arrived.
Madhuri has brought life in the party.
Amitabh from Deewar..
You don't know his magic!
what do you think about this Bollywood theme party?
What can I tell you about his parties?
Just like how the law and order of our city..
..never fails Tejani's parties too, never fail.
But what I cannot understand is, what is Paro doing with Chunnilal.
That's our secret.
You didn't come to my party.
It was a great party.
But you came to Tejani's party?
- l was in Delhi.
But I gave good coverage.
So the Charlie's Angels are here.
Come on, Deepak.
This is supposed to be Bollywood party, okay?
Call us the three goddesses, Deepak.
- Three Goddesses.
You are not seen in the parties nowadays.
Too much work.
- Not really.
The pages of your newspapers have increased.
If it is sold, it will have to be printed.
Hi, Mrs. Bhavi..
- How are you, Madhavi?
You doing okay?
- Yeah, fine.
Enough material for your coverage.
It's good that none asked for the invite, or we'd be caught.
Come on.
We will drink and dance, come on.
What kind of people are they?
Filmi!
Filmi!
Filmi!
He is saying filmi in the presence of film people.
Give me a match.
Do you smoke imported cigarettes?
- Then what?
It is the brand of my past employer.
It is mine now.
Do you mean the diamond merchant, Mr. Kothari?
- He is gone now.
He had a solid passion for gambling.
What is gambling?
- A girl.
It's a code word.
He had a passion for girls.
He took girls on a cruise.
A cruise means?
- A cruise means a long ship.
The Titanic..
He took a dozen girls on a cruise to foreign countries.
A cruise, and then another and then another.
He was ruined one day.
- Where is he now?
Santa Cruz.
He has a ready made clothes shop in Santa Cruz.
He is ruined.
Therefore, never go in for gambling.
Huge Titanics have been sunk.
Hi, Abhijeet darling..
Honey, how is my make up?
Too loud.
Tell me.
Attitude.
Bollywood parties tonight.
They have different styles and attitudes.
They have different styles and attitudes.
Even then, the world bows to their attitude.
How are you?
- Hi.
Okay. I have spoken to Rakesh about your photo shoot.
You just contact him and give him my reference.
You are looking very beautiful today.
Take care.
- Thanks.
What about Mehta brothers?
I have heard that there is some dispute between them?
We have heard the same thing too.
But I think that..
- Excuse me, darling..
Have you seen Rhea anywhere?
She must be around.
They have different styles and attitudes.
I think that the party is warming up.
It will be five.
Therefore, I am telling you not to have more than five pegs.
Pearl, this is Harsh Thakur, a family friend.
Also, a very big hotelier from LA and UK.
- Hi.
I have seen you on my flight very often, nice to meet you.
Same here.
Excuse me.
Hi, Vijaya.
- Hi!
- How are you?
Who is the new one with Harsh?
Pearl.. air hostess.
Another trolley to lolly.
There is enough of that.
- There's enough lolly to go around.
Thanks.
- Good night. - Thanks for the great time.
Bye, Sheetal.
- Bye.
- Move back.
Come on, Mr. Jhulka.
Thank you.
It is the world of youth.
I have been watching you.
For a long time.
You are a good guy.
You look handsome on the ramp.
Listen about yesterday. I had such fun.
- Tell me.
Bosco, these are Ram and Balram.
They stay together.
What are you talking about?
- These drivers will be together.
But their sir and madam, they come and go together.
And they stay together too.
What?
I had gone to the Dubai festival now.
Yes..
They used to stay together.
Even I was ashamed.
What are you saying?
- lt is just the Dubai Festival, during that.
They must have gone for some shopping.
Not shopping.
There is less shopping and more swapping there.
What is swapping?
Exchange..
- What are you talking about?
It is a tip from Dubai.
You come to Delhi.
You bring your family with you.
See, what a royal treatment I give you.
Hi..
This is my friend, Gayatri.
Our editor, Deepak Suri.
Hi Gayatri.
Nice look.
What's going on?
Nothing.. are you going?
My wife is waiting for me.
She hates all this.
How are you going home?
Tarun will drop me home.
Oh.. so he is the guy.
No.. just a good friend.
- Good friend?
See you, bye.
Bye.
Akash..
There is always some special in your parties.
What is special this time?
Can any Hollywood party be without an item number?
Oh my god!
Oh!
That's amazing!

The husband's brother comes for one month.

As soon as he leaves, I lose my heart.

It's a song for the masses.
I will drown in water, I will drown in water.
Nice song, isn't it?
Truck driver's song.
How will I take care of my youth?

Just a minute, it is Madam Babar's phone.
Hello.

Yes sir.
I will take the car out right now.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
This mobile is a headache.
The Doberman will bark now, come on.
Pearl.. if you don't mind, please iron my clothes too.
Where are you going?
- l am going to meet Rohit Kumar.
Keep it here.
- Thanks.
And listen..
My clothes are hanging the balcony, bring them.
- Thank you.
Shut up!
Why are you clapping?
is this a cricket ground?
This is a society compound.
Go and play in the ground.
Will your father pay if the glass breaks?
As it is, your father doesn't pay maintenance.
I am so sorry, uncle. I am so sorry.
What sorry?
Did you get my head to throw this?
Sorry. - ls the matter done if you say sorry?
There were two problems.
There is a third one too now.
I had told no to the secretary, I had told no.
Not to give flats to single girls.
Bakul Patel is gone today.
I won't spare him today.
They come back at one thirty in the night.
This bloody idiot is dead.
- Let it go!
Such nice and respectable live here.
Hey, Bakul.
What is your problem?
Why are you irritating her?
Talk to me.
I don't talk to women, go.
Yes, you don't talk to women, but grope them.
And that too, housemaids.
- Forget it.
What should I forget?
Hey, fatso..
You see a lone girl and flirt with her.
What is your problem?
Should I come down?
- No..
No.. stay there.
Stay there.
You flirt with girls in the Nana Nani park..
You wait. lf l meet you, should I come down?
This is the limit.
What are you smiling about?
is there a drama going on here?
Go to the ground, go to the ground.
Sir, please give this.
Yes.
Looking at socialite's plastic smiles in the party circuit..
..I thought where would I get so see real smiles?
I got the answer in these kids.
In their unconditional love.
They don't see what is whose status.
Who is happening and who is not.
You know what I mean?
So.. sorry.
So this is what motivated you?
Yes.
And my husband.
Ramesh has really supported me.
He funds this children's funds too.
Okay.
- Tell me something.
You were ex miss India, isn't it?
Forget it.
There wasn't any hype at that time.
Yatin.. come here..
How are you?
I am all right.
Does this play songs?
- Yes, it does.
Good boy.
You know.. what is printed in which parties you go to.
But nobody writes about your good work.
You write it.
People will come to know about it.
Did you read about Anjali Thapar in page 3?
Nothing much to talk about.
Hey, did you read the Anjali Thapar piece in the Metro Today?
Yes. lt speaks less about social less and party animals more.
Exactly.
You are coming to Jack's party tonight?
Sir.. did you see?
Anjali Thapar's interview was cut, the meaning was lost.
There was a ad in the last meeting.
I told Fauze to cut it.
But sir..
I have worked so hard on it, sir.
What the hell is this?
You cut Anjali Thapar's social work details from the article.
Could you not cut anything else?
You just reduced it to a social butterfly.
Did she pay you?
This is the problem.
All you think about is money.
I don't know what has happened to journalism.
Who told you that you are a journalist?
This is what you write in the page 3 column isn't it?
Who went in whose party, with whom who went..
And with whom who came back..
Who wore, ate and drank what..
And what one didn't wear.
Miss Madhavi Sharma.
This is called entertainment.
Not journalism.
Some people never change.
Out of them is this.
Our Vinayak Mane.
What is the matter?
Why did you call me?
Sir, I have got a tip.
- What?
Our drug dealer, Gomes..
..he is bringing drugs at the Pali Hill bungalow.
When, today?
Yes.
Tonight?
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.
Should I call Mr. Bhosle?
Yes.
- Sure.
- Sure, sir.

Come on, Michael Jackson, Madonna, in the van.
This bloody rural man has spoiled our mood.
Excuse me.
What did you say?
Rural man?
What do you think?
We cops are vernaculars?
We don't speak English?
We don't have civic sense?
We are uncivilized people?
And for your kind information.
This vernacular rural man has done his Masters in English literature.
From Fergusson college, Pune.
The best one.
First.
Try to be a good cultured Indian.
Then.. try to be western.
Okay?
Get in the van. I said move, move fast.

Hey, what are you doing?
- Come on, hero.
Come in.
Thanks, Vinayak.
- You are welcome.
Come on, bye.
- Do you have a match?
Smoke less.
- From tomorrow.
Hey, hero, no noise.
You can't do this.
Let me talk to my dad.
Don't talk now, call later.
Go in the van now.
Hey, dude, cool it.
Do you know who my father is?
Why?
Do you not know who your father is?
Do you have a lot of fathers?
Forget your father, I know your mother too.
You are Pushpa Bhargav's son, isn't it?
What is she called in high society?
Pushy..
Isn't it?
She was in room number 603, Oberoi towers, yesterday night.
She was a younger boy than you too.
Yes.
Should I tell the horoscope, or will you sit in the van?
Cool dude, it happens.
Come on!
You rascal.
I am searching you since a year.
Why sir?
Did I commit a murder?
I sell drugs.
And I don't sell it in the government or police line.
This is the intoxication do the big people.
What is this called?
Rich and famous.
And some of your people ask it in some big parties too.
Park the car on the side.
We will speak about it right now.
Why?
What do you say?
He was talking about compromise.
Sir has taken a new way of encounter.
He was making us run since a year.
He is dead.
He is handcuffed.
He must be some criminal.
He must be escaping from the police.
It seems that he is some gang man.
It doesn't take time for the public to come in.
Oh, Mr. Mane is here.
- The whole story will be printed.
Except this part.
I know.. some problems are solved like this.
Thanks.
Bye.
The party is going on fine.
A lot of people have come.
After having four glasses of wine it is difficult to make out.
..who is the king and which is the queen.
Pack.
For four years we don't know whether he is a king or a queen.
You know Anjali. I wanted to apologise.
That article..
..it was not published properly.
I'm feeling terrible.
Anjali, what are you saying?
Whatever was published..
What I mean to say is..
You know sometimes, any publicity is good publicity.
You know after that two of my kids were adopted.
Really?
- Yes.
- Good, I'm so glad.
What's up with you?
You're so glowing and showing and all. ls there somebody?
No.
Nothing.
I want to tell you about my experience at Ladkh.
It was so horrible.
Why?
What happened?
They gave me such a shabby room to stay.
- That's horrible, Zulfi?
They didn't let me use the ladies toilet.
- My god!
How did you manage?
The worst part is that they did only two shots everyday.
Excuse me. I'm talking about the film.
You filthy mind.
You know that's why I don't do films.
I'm doing the Bhalla wedding in Jaipur any way.

Please come.
Mr. Rohit.
People think Aids patients as untouchable.
They are scared and terrified of meeting them.
You are such a big star in Bollywood.
Still you have come to meet them here.
Are you not scared?
Not at all.
They are also human beings like us.
Moreover it is possible that tomorrow you, or me..
.. for that matter anyone of us could be here in their place.
Sir, do you believe in safe sex?
- Why don't you believe in it?
Listen, I would like to say that you should show..
..loyalty to your partner.
Always have safe sex.
Especially for the youth of today I would like to say that..
..don't hesitate to buy condoms from the chemist.
Sir, your next film?
- We'll talk about that during the release.
Sir, one minute.
Madam, I'll ask the sir to phone you later.
I've something important to talk to him.
I'll make him call you.
You don't worry.
Bye, Mr. Rohit.
Ok thanks.
Gayatri what are you doing here?
I've been trying to get you on the mobile but in vain.
Then I came to know that you're here, so I came here.
Gayatri, the press and the media are here.
You shouldn't have come here.
Tell me what was the urgency.
- Rohit I'm pregnant.
Get it aborted.
Ok.
Bye.
Come on let's go.
Harsh, just a second.
Hi!
.
- So late?
Went to a movie and then had dinner at Legacy.
O I see Just a second baby.
Has Gayatri come?
- Yes, the madam's mood seems to be bad.
Why?
- The stars are moody, you should know.
Yes baby.
Don't meet that ex wife of yours.
Don't double time me. I'll beat you like a drum.
Now listen.
Did you take your medicines?
Please baby don't forget.
- Gayati.
Gayatri.
Pearl.
Please drive fast.
You'll be fine.
Ok.
Are you sure that this man is from the Chandu gang?
Hundred percent Vinayak.
He is an old charge sheeted fellow.
Twice he has committed half murders and has been to Dubai also.
Which means that he was killed in the gang war.
Listen Vinayak. ln the gang war sometimes our work becomes easier.
Yes, the governments bullets are saved.
Here she is dying and you are talking about rules doctor.
First you write a police complaint and then we'll admit her.
Please you get her admitted first.
Look I'm a journalist.
The rest of the formalities will be completed by us.
No.
- Dr. Sudharshan shall the treatment
.
No, the formalities have to be completed.
I will talk to Mr. Bhonsle.
- Vinayak.
Bhosle.
- What happened?
- This is Madhavi.
We work in the same office.
Doctor you start you treatment. I will take care of police formalities.
You first get her admitted.
- Ok.
Nurse.
- Thank you doctor.
Thanks Vinayak.
How are you here?
In these places only you get real stories.
Not in parties.
Take care of your friend. lf a need arises phone me.
Bye.
I'm fine. I don't know she is.
Yes, the doctor has admitted her.
Excuse me madam.
The patient is out of danger.
But we couldn't save the child.
Sir, a lot of phones are coming from Gayatri madam.
What should I do?
Did you not make arrangements for Gayatri madam?
I had taken twenty thousand rupees and went to her.
I ask her to get the abortion done.
She got angry with me.
She refused to talk.
Sir, it's Madhavi calling now. I'll cut it off.
O baby stop crying.
- Madam greetings.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
Why are you crying?
I'm taking Mohit for a drive.
- Take the new car.
Ok.
- Take care,
- Bye.
Drive carefully.
Why are you ringing up that bastard.
Will he come with a bouquet?
Madhavi you know that he is a public figure man.
Pearl please, Don't talk like this at this moment.
Then when do I talk?
The faster you come to your senses the better it is for you.
Pearl why are you shouting?
I'm shouting because I care man.
I care for this stupid girl.
You'll be fine.
What Rohit did to Gayathri broke her confidence completely.
She decided that she'll leave the film line.
Pearl and me convinced her a lot.
But she went back to Delhi.
With informing the editor I published an article in support of Gayatri.
There is a spicy article about your boss published in the papers.
This is not about my boss. it must be about some other hero.
Do you know English.
Will you protect your boss?
Madhavi, you are also the limit.
First you wrote about your boyfriend and I didn't tell you anything.
What evidence did you have that Rohit Kumar did this to your friend?
But sir i know..
- Do you have the proof?
No you don't have the proof.
When you write something you have to back it up with proof.
That goes for all of you.
It is fortunate that you did put his name.
Otherwise he could've sued us..
..and I hope you know that.
The company is proposing to organise..
..its publication awards for the first time.
The secretary of Rohit Kumar is saying that he'll be part of the show.
Do you realise what all has happened?
Thanks to your personal scores that ..
..you're trying to settle through this paper.
Sorry you don't have that right.
The decision of the management is that..
..you've to apologise to Rohit Kumar.
OK then.
Thanks to you. I have to take responsibility for this disaster.
I guess. lf that's what you want.
You?
Cut it.
Very good shot sir.
- Please come.
Thank god. I have to get ready for the next shot.
Call of them. I need them for the night shot.
Sir, Madhavi madam and Mr. Suri have come to meet you.
You get them seated, I'll come.
- Ok sir.
Joe, I'm just coming.
Come on.
Don't move.
Come here.
Hello Mr. Suri.
How are you?
- l'm fine.
- Hi.
Please sit down.
Hey give me a sponge.
Will you have anything?
- No.
Will you have anything.
How is everything Mr. Suri.
- Fine.
I heard that you'll not perform in our award function.
Who told you that?
Of course I'm coming.
These must be rumors.
For me a commitment is always a commitment, come what may.
However I've been hurt by what happened.
Especially because it was done by a friend.
You're absolutely right.
You're right. lt hurts.
You're right.
Right Madhavi?
Rohit. I just wanted to say sorry for this whole thing.
Hey Madhavi.
Relax buddy. it's Ok.
I know it happens. I've no grudges at all.
We're friends, fine.
How did you ever think otherwise?
They're friends!
Friends.
Mr. Suri, I tell you that your show will be very successful.
Yes, I mean it.
I heard that you're going to Guwahati for a shooting.
Yes, Mr. Suri.
The shot demands that I shoot there..
The interesting part is that the character..
I understand.
Star tensions.
Forget it Madhavi.
These things keep happening.
Professional hazards l should say.
Look there. - l'm sorry buddy.
- Look at that girl there.
You have started looking at girls?
- Yes, some of them.
If this girl is so beautiful how handsome her brother should be?
You are..
- l was just joking.
How is Gayathri?
- l didn't get any phone call from her.
How is Pearl?
- She is getting married and going to US.
Lucky girl.
- Yes.
There comes Tarun.
What happened to his car?
Couldn't pay the installments.
The bank people took away his car.
Vijay, you have a lot of contact in the ad world, isn't it?
Why don't you use it to get Tarun some big modelling assignment?
If I use my contact he will not like it.
Actually it has been discussed in three to four places.
- Really?
Something will be worked out.
You don't worry.
- Thanks.
I'll reach the airport in half an hour.
Madhavi take care of yourself.
Let's go Pearl.
Bye.
- Bye.
You're shifting to New York after marriage.
I've been left alone.
Listen, if that baldy bothers you, give him slap on my behalf.
Drink less wine, understood?
If you are reminded of me give me a phone call.
is it?
International calls are very expensive, understood?
That is why I asked you to marry a millionaire.
Shut up.
Ok.
You shut up.
Yes.
When did this happen?
Ok I'll pass the information.
Sir, there is a breaking news.
Anjali Thappar committed suicide.
Show me that.
Hello.
Hi.
What?
Madam Anjali is dead!
Hemant call the fashion designer.
So you need something for the funeral..
..as well as the chautha (fourth day after death).
I'll arrange for that.
No problem.
When?
Ok I'll be there.
Show me something in white.
It must be because of depression.
Just a question of your life.
Honey where are you?
- l'm outside our bunglow.
Here everyone has come.
- Come on now stop it.
I'm in the midst of a three hundred million deal.
Don't disturb me.
The one who had to die has died.
It's only a dead body there.
I know that.
But you have to do all these formalities.
Papa.
Do you think that Thappar will marry again?
Why?
What are your intentions?
Thappar is not a bad man.
But his daughter, my god!
What have you got to do with the daughter?
- Forget it.
Vijaya, I heard you're writing a new book.
What is the subject?
So you're also interested in reading books?
Anyway, what is there in your books other than sex?
What else interests you?
That's a point.
Buddy, madam Anjali was such a nice woman.
She used to throw nice parties.
- Right.
How much liquor we must have had..
..on the house out of Mr. Thapar's money?
Will there be no more parties?
Don't get worried. lt will start after the thirteenth day.
is it?
Let's go and mourn.
- Let's go.
Did you get any assignment?
- l'm trying.
Ok, I'll take leave.
Any idea where they will cremate her.
Shivaji park or Chandanwadi?
Chandanwadi since most of her relatives are coming there.
I think it will be a sandalwood cremation.
Definitely not Sneha.
This is a jet age. lt will be the electric.
Moreover it is environment friendly, takes less time also, I guess you're right.
She was a gem of a lady.
I have met her in lot of parties.
In fact I have given a lot of donation for her charities.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?
Let me talk.
Whatever happened is very bad.
God bless her soul.
Do you want me say something more.
- No, thank you sir.
Thank you.
Please.
Please.
You must be seeing that the crowd of celebrities..
..is increasing out side the Thapar house.
This is Archala Thripathi for FTV.
Tell me when they will take the body?
I can't live without the air conditioners.
Sir, then how are you doing your journeys..
..by foot and rallies in this heat?
Listen Joe. ln politics one has to do all these dramatics.
Then it is all a drama that you play act?
Like your films Joe.
You get a chance and you start defaming the film industry.
Then Samar, how is your security business going on?
It is running fine buddy.
The last elections I provided security..
..to so many people.
But not a single payment has been received.
Anjali Thapar's death is a loss to humanity.
The children in her orphanage.
She loved them a lot.
She had a great affection for them.
She looked after them well.
Under what circumstances she died, about that..
Arti madam, what would you say?
It's all very sad.
She was a sweet lady.
She had come my films trial once and she liked my work a lot.
In fact she use to encourage me to do a lot of good work, you know.
I can't take it that she is no more.
It's not nice buddy.
- This is life buddy.
After a few days everything is forgotten.
Then there is only the photo that is hanged.
Maximum what will happen.
Mr. Thapar will get a road named after her.
Anjali Thapar avenue.
When people like us dies one doesn't get..
..people who will carry the coffin.
Relax dear.
Anjali has left us forever.
It's so shocking.
Let's not waste it. I've missed our relationship a lot, Samir.
Don't know what I am in search of.
Samir I was so good to you and you were so good to me.
Samir please forgive me.
Joey are going to join the funeral?
I'll definitely be there.
I've seen a lot of Hindi movies that worries me.
I'm yet to see a Hindu funeral. I'll definitely go. - l'll go with you.
Mark my words.
The who's who of Mumbai are going to be there.
I heard that a lot of Bollywood stars are going to be there.
Yes they will.
Are you leaving?
Yes, I have an ad film shooting at the airport runaway.
We've got only two hours permission. I'll have to go.
- Fine.
They are disgusting.
They have started here also.
Buddy, why do they come to the funeral with dark glasses on.
Half of them drink in the night.
Their eyes must be red.
To hide that they wear dark glasses, understood.
Take the interview.
Madam Ritu, how are you feeling about the sudden demise of Mrs. Thapar?
I still can't believe that she is dead.
We were like sisters.
Unfortunately I was in Paris..
..for the promotion of my new herbal cosmetic range.
It is sad. I'm really going to miss her.
Move away.
You think this is some fun going on.
Just stop it.
Can't you make out where to take photographs and were not to?
John ask that journalist when this interview will be telecast.
By the way did you to Hemant's party?
- Yes, we did.
Was Sakshi there?
- After the party.
Madam, today night at eight.
I swear.
Who are you sending a message?
Every one should come to know that Ritu Bajaj is back in Mumbai.
Right.
- And tonight she will be in Ajtak TV.
I want to express my condolences to the entire Thapar family.
Thank you.
Sir, one more question.
I want you to quote.
There are lot of Hindi films on police these days.
What have you got to say about that?
Would you like this quote in Hindi or English?
In Hindi please.
How was your shooting in Andaman sir?
- Fantastic.
We shot in scorching heat.
Are you coming with me?
If both of us go together it won't look nice.
You go now. I'll just join you.
See you later, bye.
Abhijit has told me about you.
The campaign that you've done.
Papa.
They meet for a couple of moments and walk together.
They meet for a couple of moments and walk together.
When the crossing comes they escape away.
How strange relationships exist here.
How strange relationships exist here.
That's great.
That's good.
So many people did attend the funeral
Madhavi, five hundred words by four o clock please.
I can't write it sir.
What?
What will I write?
That people were planning their next party sitting there.
Messages were being sent.
They were discussing what diamond set will match with white dress.
Shall I write all these?
Five hundred words. - l can't.
I'm so sick of it. I can't
Then what do you want to write?
There is something that..
- what?
Something more meaningful.
More meaningful.
That's wonderful.
Social issues, like Rape, dowry..
..and all that kind of things, right?
- Yes.
Do you have any experience.
Do you understand what you're talking?
I don't want to do page 3.
One stubborn woman.
Anyway, come in.
Come.
Vinayak.
Madhavi wants to do crime also.
is it?
Then?
For some day you teach her the routine.
Sir, with me shell..
Vinayak she is serious.
She wants to do meaningful journalism, right?
So it's decided that for fifteen days you'll be with Vinayak.
is that all right?
Done.
Now Anjali Thapar, five hundred words, four O clock, thank you.
Sir where are putting me with her?
is she going to stick there?
She is a party person.
She'll return in four days.
Trust me.
Trust me.
Challenge.
Hello. I'm reaching there.
We're reaching there.
Working with Vinayak I learnt that crime based journalism is no party.
In search of stories Vinayak used to work day and night.
Tarun did not like my idea of working in this field.
But he did support me.
We used to reach any nook or corner of Mumbai in search of a story.
I'm fine.
- Hi Madhavi, what a pleasant surprise?
Madhavi is working with me on crime reporting.
That is why she is not seen in parties these days.
Madhavi there are a few celebrities who in spite of not having..
..photographers nearby come to such places and work.
Pratima madam is one of them.
Come on Vinayak.
Doesn't your articles create awareness?
That is just like that.
Shall I do some work?
This is Munna.
Our lnformer.
This person is working with me.
- Yes sir.
- Recognise her.
Listen Gullu.
Stop this trade in children.
Get reformed.
Otherwise you'll be jailed for a long period.
Understood?
- Yes sir.
Take him to the court.
Yes Vinayak.
- Yes boss.
You must be knowing her, Madhavai Sharma.
Yes, that day in the hospital..
- Yes sir.
These days she is working with me in crime week.

What will you have?
Shaukat Ali.
When did they take him away.
Fifteen days before.
They have booked him in POTA.
They don't even allow us to meet him.
They say that he is an extremist.
Did he have a criminal record.
Yes doctor.
Come on fast.
Sir, there are fifteen injured.
Yes sir, fifteen.
Dead bodies?
Five have reached this hospital till now.
Five, yes sir.
I'll keep you informed sir.
Photographs will be taken sir.
Yes sir, thank you.
Hello.

Shalini is sick.
She can't cover the Diwan's marriage in Marriet.
You will have to cover it.
Sir the coverage of the blast.
Vinayak is there.
He is covering it, isn't it.
But sir, a party today?
But sir..
Madhavi this is also work.
- Ok.
My friend.. why did you face away like this?
My friend.. why did you face away like this?
I will look at the mirror.
I will look at the mirror.
It's amazing to travel in the first class.
Hi, Madhavi.
- Hi.
How have you been?
- Fine, thanks.
Long time no see, isn't it?
As it is, even I wasn't here.
I was in Spain since three months.
For the showing of my collection.
Absolutely amazing.
I must send you some photographs.
- Sure.
Hi..
Hello..
- Hi..
You know what?
Don't you know about her?
She is no more with page 3.
What is she doing?
Crime beat.
- Crime beat?
How depressing.
I know.
Okay.
Will you take some time?
Just some time more.
- Okay, so I end up first.
Take care.
Take a little bit of rose water.
You put it in and you mix it correctly.
Keep mixing it for a while and then..
Hi..
- l, Hi, Madhavi, how are you?
You are in the crime beat nowadays?
Yes.
Oh!
I heard that there was a blast in the city.
Oh..
This place is very unsafe.
I am very scared.
Okay, Madhavi.
Yes, so what was I saying?
Take some turmeric, and some rose water.
And after mixing it, below the eyes..
Now, see the movement, okay?
What do you think?
Do you think there is some foreign hand in it?
I have taken the inside photos.
Well, we do suspect some foreign hand behind it.
We aren't very sure about it, although.
Anyway, our intelligence will find out immediately.
Do you know, Mr. Vinay?
As soon as we got the call, my force controlled it immediately.
That's how my force is.
Hi, Madhavi.
As it is, you don't have to be scared of this bomb blast.
Because the situation is in our control and..
What is the matter?
What is the matter?
Nothing, I was thinking, there was a blast in the city,
There is a tension outside, the ACP should be in his area and jurisdiction.
You are in a party here.
It isn't even 24 hours to the blast.
Do you even know how many people are injured?
And there are a lot of places in your areas with communal tensions.
Just because of the bomb blasts.
There can be riots too.
Should you be here or there?
Hey, come on.
Madhavi, life moves on.
That's the spirit of our Mumbai.
If you want to know the spirit of Mumbai..
..you should have been on the site of the blast.
You should have seen how people help each other.
But how will you understand that?
You are in high spirits.
See, Madhavi.
- Don't worry.
The people who died in the blast..
..whether their photos get printed or not, your photos will be printed.
On Page 3.
Madhavi.. come on.
Waiter.. my drink.
Cool it.
That is great. lt is three days for the bomb blast.
The culprit isn't caught, but the suspect escaped from the police jeep.
The jeep?
Hey.. hello.
Are you over your bomb blast trauma?
Yes, sir.
Vinayak.
- Yes?
- Well done.
Thank you, sir.
And Madhavi, well done.
- Thank you, sir, thank you.
What about the MLA case?
I am going to Nashik in that matter.
What shall we do about this?
Shall we keep her on crime beat or back to page 3?
No sir. I want to continue with this.
No, sir, you send her to page 3.
At least she won't fight with the ACP there.
You know that?
It is my profession to keep tabs.
Madhavi..
Fauziya and Shalini are taking over.
They will make your boy friend disappear from page 3.
I will bring him to the page one.
He will remain on page 3.
He is getting a very big modeling assignment.
He didn't tell me.
How did you find it out?
I am the editor.
Yes, he is the editor.
Maybe, he wanted to surprise me.
- Candle light dinner.
No four.. two.
Good day, Madhavi.
Yes, Shalini.
Yes.
I was stuck in the traffic.
Yes, I have reached right now.
Okay, I will talk to you a little later.
Okay?
Bye.
Auto..
Khusrow..
Listen to me, Madhavi.
Please. I am sorry.
You were hurt because of me.
But..
I am not the only guilty one.
Tarun wanted assignments from me.
It is done now, Madhavi.
There was nothing intentional about it.
Let's forget about it, such things happen.
It happens in society.
Listen to me.
I don't want to lose a friend like you, Madhavi.
Please, forget it.
Please..
Madhavi..
Tarun never called me, nor did I.
Maybe he didn't need me anymore.
I involved myself in work, I didn't have time to think about anything else.
Whenever I got time..
..I used to spend time in Anjali's children home.
Give it to me..
Rhea..
Hi..
- Hi.
Wow.. good work..
Thanks Madhavi.
Hello, madam. I am Munna here.
Yes, Munna.
- ls Vinayak there?
No, Vinayak is in Nashik.
Tell me what happened?
- No, I have to give him a message.
Tell me.
Okay.
Okay I will come.
Sir, we have got a message.
Gullu has got 25 kids from UP.
Sir, he has hidden them in the Chira Bazar godown.
Sure?
- Yes, sir.
Mhatre.. take the car out.
Hey.. come on!
Come on!
Don't act.
Stand straight.
Bhosle, there are ten children less.
There was an information about 28.
Hey..
Gullu.
Didn't I tell you?
Where are the ten kids?
Please don't hit me. I will tell you.
- Tell me, come on, tell me.

Come on, tell me the address.
That..
Madh Island, bungalow number 16.
Satam, take him.
Come on!
Come on!
Bhosale, shall we go?
- We cannot raid everywhere.
This is Mumbai's gutter.
It is better if it stays closed.
What do you mean?
I mean, I don't have a warrant.
There are people above me too.
Vinayak had told me something else about the way you work.
Bhosale..
Magistrate Joshi will get the search warrant.
Come on, it is about the lives of small kids.
We will have to save them.
Bhosale..
These people..
Come on, open the door.
Hey wait.. what is going on?
- Come on, didn't I tell you?
What is the matter?
Where are you going?
Why are you hitting me?
- Check everything, don't spare anyone.
Go there.
- There.. there..
These people.
Stop the kissing.
Search for the kids.
Come on.
Come here..
Look.
Hey, Tom Cruise.. come on.
Hi.. where are the rest of your friends?
Come on.

Gaikwad.

What do you think of yourselves?
I will take care of you.
Bastard.. made the wife and daughter sleep first.
Pimp for fair flesh, you pimp!
You are very excited, isn't it?
You are in heat?
Thapar.. you have less money that you are making children sleep?
Come on!
- Don't worry.
Sir, I am Madhavi.
Yes, tell me.
Sir, I have very important news.
Breaking news.
We will have to stop the press.
Why?

Yes, it is important.
Okay.

Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

Sir, my bag.
Thank you sir, good night.
- Good night.
Sir.. child abuse.
They were under age children.
Leave Mr. Thapar now.
Drugs were being consumed there.
Don't argue with me, okay?
Ignore everything and move out of there with your men.
Give it to Mr. Thapar now.
- Sir.
Yes?
- How are you?
- l am fine.
Everything is done, okay?
- Yes, Mr. Kadam.
- Take care.
Thank you for your help, Mr. Bhosale.
Let's go, Marvin.
Gaikwad, release everyone.
- Yes, sir.
I will keep you informed about the developments.
No..
I will take care of the fix myself.
Mr. Kadam, our relations go way back.
Don't worry. I will take care of the rest.
Okay, bye bye.
Driver, go out.
- Yes, sir.
This is all of it?
They are all the evidence.
We shouldn't leave this story.
He is a sick man.
This should be published.
Are you crazy?
We get the most advertising revenue..
..from the Thapar Group of companies and their foreign collaborators.
That means, money.
And don't you know about their lobby?
Yes, Mr. Kadam.
Yes, tell me.
Tell Mr. Thapar not to worry, every thing will be in control.
Fine, Mr. Mirchandani.
Bye, bye.
What is the name of that girl?
Sir, she is a good journalist.
We will lose a good journalist.
Fire the bitch.
Remove her.
You may leave now.
Good night, sir.
Come in.
Why didn't the article get printed?
We had stopped the press.
Was it very late?
Sir..
Would you like to sit down, Madhavi?
No.
This was not done, sir.
This is not done.
I thought that you would help me.
I..
I believed in you, sir.
It was the question of small children's lives.
And you know that.
Why?
Why did you do that?
It was a good story, Madhavi.
Good story.
Yes, sir.
I understand sir, but..
Sorry, ma'am.
We have already hired somebody.
Mail your resume.
We will get back to you.
Okay.
Thank you.
No. I will look for some other job.
It is easy to run from the truth.
It is difficult to face it.
I was trying to tell the truth, isn't it?
But nobody wants to listen.
- lt isn't like that.
The people want to listen to the truth.
How do we tell that?
Thapar's story was laid down.
It was your fault.
- Why?
It was wrong for you to dare to cover the story.
And secondly, you gave all the proof.
Didn't keep anything with you.
Why did you believe in people, Madhavi?
The system will want to stop you, isn't it?
Do you know why Anjali Thapar committed suicide?
Because she found out that her husband..
..was picking up kids from her orphanage and with them..
Madhavi.. it is necessary to tell the truth.
It is important to find out how to tell that.
Sense is as necessary as being honest is.
We have to be in the system..
..to change the system.
Remember this.
See, Madhavi, there is a job in my publication.
But not the beat that you want.
I can just give you the page three beat.
And I think, you are best suited for that.
Tell me.
Will you do it?
Yeah.
Just need to keep it on for a few more days.
You cover it there, I will come, okay?
We will meet page 3's regular celebrity..
..and the host of this party, Mr. Hiren Sanghvi.
Mr. Sanghvi, how do you feel on your company's first year anniversary bash?
Oh, it's great. India is great!
I mean.. my business turnover is hundred crores.
Bombay is really rocking.
Shall I tell it in English?
No, thank you, I got it.
- Or in hindi?
Hey, welcome back. - lt's been so long.
We really missed you.
Really?
Aren't you drinking?
I have given up drinking.
Well, cheers for you then.
You are everywhere. I see you in a lot of ads.
Good luck.
Hi, Madhavi.

There is no problem and no worries.

I heard that you joined the Glitz Express.
Yes.

He is an upcoming model.

What did she say?
Let it be.
- So, what is your program now?

So if it's just a sex thing then, you can, get it under control, right?
- It is completely and totally over.
- Did you fuck all night ... before you told her I was the love of your life this morning?
!
- Looks like I'm having this baby on my own.
- And your OK with that.
I want this baby more than ever.
I know it's not my place to judge you and I don't know what's going on with you and Jenny...
- ..but I think this is wrong.
- Did you guys hear what happened to Marina?
- What?
- A nervous breakdown, complete and total.
- I just wanna say goodbye.
- Yeah, you going somewhere?
- Ohio, I took a job there.
- I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.
You should stay here.
Take over the lease.
Can't afford the rent on this house.
- Kit, I don't have fifty thousand dollars.
- Ivan's the only one that -who could possibly
- Ivan is not a good idea.
- Not yet.
Ivan.
I'm a little early!
I didn't see anything.
You don't think that you could've changed your plan a little bit?
I don't have a plan.
That's the point.
- Is that good?
- That's really good.
Tim.
Don't leave.
Where's Claybourne?
Oh!
Claybourne!
Claybourne!
Fuck!
Oh!
2x02 - "Lap Dance"
It was, uh, Bette's house.
She bought it before we met.
But she put me on the title after I moved in.
Did you contribute to the mortgage payments?
I offered, but Bette never wanted me to.
I made pretty good money as a Development Executive, but not as much as Bette and she insisted on paying the mortgage.
And you always did what Bette wanted?
No.
Did you pay for anything?
I... uh, paid for utilities and I... ..paid for the food.
Although most of the utilities are in Bette's name.
Well of course they are.
That's the way she wanted it.
Why should the little wife have to put her name on anything?
That's absolutely not the case.
I... ..just never bothered to change it.
Look, I don't even know why I'm here.
I'm not going after Bette's money.
- If we wind up in court -
- Wind up in court?
Whoa!
I don't wanna be here.
She had to do something, so I hooked her up.
With a lawyer?
Joyce Wischnia is the leading gay civil rights attorney in L.A.
Jesus, Al, you and your fucking "best of" lists.
Bette and Tina don't need that.
Well, I wasn't really thinking about Bette, I was thinking about Tina.
- Fine.
What do you think she needs?
- I don't know.
A lap dance, maybe.
Not a fucking lawyer.
- Closed?
- What?
Shit.
Do you want me to tell you why you need a lawyer?
Okay.
Because in the eyes of the world, especially the world as embodied by the courts,
.. you are shit.
You gave up your autonomy in a relationship that the law doesn't recognize.
- And your ex controls everything.
- She always said what's hers is mine.
Doesn't matter whose name it was in.
If I needed money in my checking account, I just took it from savings;
I was authorized on the account.
I never had to ask her for anything.
- Does it bother you if I smoke?
- I really wish that you wouldn't.
If you don't mind.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's review the facts.
- Did you give up your career at her urging?
- Yes.
Did you make a home for her, did you cook, decorate, entertain,
..fill the house with liveliness and warmth?
Yes.
Okay.
Did you offer your womb to give birth to her child?
Bette doesn't know about this.
I mean, nobody knows about this.
- You're kidding.
- I just started showing.
I had a miscarriage about five months ago.
Bette didn't handle it so well.
I didn't want her to have to go through it again.
So you went and got inseminated on your own, and you're protecting her until you're sure it's going to stick.
Yeah.
And then she cheated on you.
She spread her legs for another woman.
- Could you please not say that?
- It's true!
Deal with it.
- Doesn't it make you angry?
- Fuck, yes.
So what do you want?
Take responsibility for yourself.
Get what you rightfully deserve.
And don't let Bette decide that for you.
Look, Tina.
I am not a marriage wrecker.
If you want to get back together with Bette... do you?
- I don't know.
- Well, either way.
You have to come to this from a position of strength.
Whether or not you and Bette eventuall reconcile - especially if you decide to get back together... and rebuild your relationship?
First, you need to have your autonomy.
- Can you see why?
- Yes, I can see why.
- I want my autonomy.
- Okay.
Who's Bette's lawyer?
The - the, the, Somalian Headtrip, the espresso of the day.
I - is that different from a regular shot?
- No.
- It's not.
- No.
Okay.
Well then, can I have two...
of whichever's strongest.
- Okay.
- Okay?
And can I have it filled ... in a - tall cup, halfway?
Okay.
Any flavoring?
What?
In my coffee?
What the fuck is he talking about with the flavoring?
Hey!
Guys.
- Sorry, can you excuse us?
- Sorry.
Excuse me-
Shane does not know what she's doing here.
What do you normally have at The Planet?
A double shot.
Give the woman a baby mindblower with an extra hit of espresso.
You're gonna need the extra hit, Shane.
I mean, even though they call it the mindblower, it's still not as strong as Planet coffee.
We will each have a toffee nut caramel soy far-out frappe.
You don't mind, right?
Since we're here?
- A toffee... nut... soy...
- Far-out frappe.
- Far-out frappe.
That's... that's intense, Tonya.
That's what I'm in the mood for.
Dana didn't really say that she as in the mood for one, though.
No, but she likes what I like.
She always wants what I want more than what she wants.
Right?
- It's true, I do.
- So nice.
- So lesbian.
Ivan's not calling me back.
Ivan, uh, doesn't wanna talk.
Just tell me where sh - he is.
I've been to the apartment, he's not there.
He's got a cabin in Idyllwild.
- He's got a cabin?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Ivan's got a cabin.
Yeah.
Yeah, dude's set up.
Hey, I, you know, I appreciate you being protective but it - it's not what you think.
I really care for Ivan.
Sure.
I need to talk to him.
You know, what happened, you know, with the two of you?
- When I saw her?
- When you saw her.
Yeah.
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have busted in, I should've waited.
It was bad.
I know it was bad for Ivan, but it was unsettling for me, too
- You know, but we can get past that.
- Yeah, well, maybe not Ivan.
Ohh, it's crazy, of course we can!
- Y - just - just - let me have his address, please?
- Naw, you know, it'd be better to wait.
- Let him chill for a few days.
- I can't wait!
Then when Ivan gets back, just don't mention it.
Like it didn't happen
Dax!
I can't wait.
I don't have a few days, you know what I'm sayin'?
Bette, I scoured the rentals.
These guys do a lot of short stays, people coming in to do movies and that kind of thing.
Give me that!
I cannot fucking afford movie star prices!
Uh, sorry, no, you misunderstood.
Its crew people, not movie stars.
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Okay, uh...
- Here it is.
It's a little one bedroom over on Barham.
- In the Valley?
- On the cusp.
It has a 323 area code so -
- What, are you trying to make sure she leaves me?
It's one of the few places that rents month-to-month.
I thought if she wants to come home after a month -
- I want you to keep looking.
- Okay, I'll keep looking.
And find something nicer.
I will not have Tina living like that.
Well, uh, if you're willing... ..if you want to sign a six month lease, I saw this little...
I will sign a six month lease, I don't care if I lose my money, as long as it means Tina's coming home.
Okay
Here we go.
This is, uh...
Come in.
I thought that you would be interested to know I got a call from Tina's lawyer.
What kind of lawyer?
Uh, her name is Joyce Wischnia, and she claims to specialize in civil and family matters.
- She's famous.
- I never heard of her.
She's a gay civil rights lawyer.
She was one of the first to support same-sex adoptions.
Tina and I were going to use her.
She also does estate planning and child custody, domestic partnership arrangements...
And separation and divorce.
The hunter and... ... the hunted.
You have twenty minutes to write.
It's fiction.
Not an essay.
Not a poem.
Not a stream of consciousness bellow of yearning from you soul.
Where's Aaron Engleberg?
Where'd you learn about violin making, Aaron?
It's been passed down through my family.
My great-grandfather, my grandfather, and my father.
All are master violin makers.
Very poignant.
Lovely story, it was my favorite submission.
Thank you.
The author of Storm Seller, S-E-L-L-E-R?
Hunter Kirby.
Nice use of metaphor, Hunter.
But watch out for the puns.
And tell your dad I said hello.
I will.
And, uh, my godfather says to say hello.
- Who's your godfather?
- Edward.
Albee.
Where is Sarah Shuster?
It's Jenny Schecter, actually.
Jenny Schecter, Sarah Shuster.
Well, well.
Miss Schecter has written a story called Thus Spoke Sarah Schuster.
Uh, yes, I realize that it's arrogant.
Well arrogant is fine.
Hubristic,... ..overly precious bad puns are to be avoided.
Especially if someone wants to be accepted into my class.
Shall we begin?
The hunter... ..and the hunted.
This never happened.
That's it.
Put down your pens.
That's right.
And cut.
Back to first positions, please.
Oh, God.
How long have you been there?
Just a, uh...
Just a few minutes, I saw that sexy guitar player hitting on you.
Yeah.
Listen, I hope you don't mind, your mom told me where you were.
Oh, no, no, I don't mind.
- Come with me?
- Yeah.
Well, also, I wanted... to apologize.
About the other night.
I was an asshole.
I know you don't want to talk to me.
Who told you where I am?
Look, we need to talk so we can...
get this behind us.
Well, I'm busy right now.
Ivan, I need your help.
And, I know it's a bad time, but I just need 15 minutes.
No, that's okay, you know, you don't want to... get involved with anybody, and that is cool.
- I'm glad it's cool with you.
- It's totally cool.
Well, it doesn't mean that we can't fuck.
You want to fuck me?
Carmen?
Oh, fuck.
- Ignore it.
- I, I can't.
Uh, yeah.
Go for Carmen.
I need a fresh battery, ASAP.
- Carmen?
- No, no, no, wait.
Okay, yeah, right away.
What are you doing later?
Oh, God, I have to go over to my grandmother's, I can't let her down.
No problem.
I could come over to your place late.
No...
no, my roommates are gonna be there.
Well, what about tomorrow?
- No, tomorrow I'm getting a lap dance.
- Well, I could do a lap dance for you.
Yeah, I'd like that.
But, it - it's for my friend.
She just, uh, she got out of this relationship.
Yeah, those relationships.
They can really fuck you up.
Yeah.
You want a beer?
You're not drinking...
It's non-alcoholic.
I'm not going to blow my sobriety, Kit.
Ivan, this - this doesn't have to be that hard.
I mean, after seeing you as a woman, your body's beautiful.
- I mean, unless you don't want to be -
- Hey, you know, why don't you just tell me what you want from me, okay?
I brought... my business plan.
My sister Bette's gonna co-sign for the loan.
But the bank won't lend me the $75,000 unless I can come up with $50,000 in cash, and she - she just doesn't have it.
$50,000 dollars is a lot of money.
Tomorrow I have to meet Manfredi Ferrer,
..Marina's dad, and if I don't have it together then... ..it's over for me.
Leave your business plan, I'll look it over.
- I have things I need to do now.
- Ivan...
Is... is there a... a chance?
You shouldn't count on me.
Wild boar hunting.
Well, that's certainly a literal interpretation.
Glock's submission looks promising.
I like the description of the, uh... ..lawn mower.
Always go for detail.
I see that Jenny Schecter has set her story of The Hunter and the Hunted in a... carnival.
Is that a true story, Schecter?
- Yes.
How did you know?
- It lacks imagination.
You haven't transformed it into fiction.
Thanks for trying, people.
You'll all hear from me within the next ten days.
- Why are we doing this?
- Because we want them to take part in the wedding.
We want them in the wedding photos We want your father to give you away.
Yeah, give me away.
He's probably going to disown me.
Honey, they know that we're getting married.
Don't they?
Yes.
And they haven't disowned us yet have they?
Pookie, the worst they can do is refuse to acknowledge us.
Which is pretty much what they're doing already, right?
Yeah.
- I need you to go get ready.
- Okay.
I need you to wear your hair in a ponytail.
And let me take care of everything else.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Fuck, Tina.
Your shit's everywhere.
Fuck.
- Where the fuck is Tina?
- Bette.
She's not here, but you're welcome to come in.
She's at work, um...
- she and Oscar are in some big project
- Did you know she's hiring a lawyer?
She's not hiring one, she just went for a consultation.
Provide bank statements?
Have the house reappraised?
Supply a list of my assets?
Does that sound like a consultation?
She was just going to get some advice.
I thought she needed it, you know, to feel like she had some options.
- You thought...?
- Bette, you know what?
She doesn't have any money.
She doesn't have anything of her own anymore.
You sent her to fucking Joyce Wischnia?
I just suggested she see a lawyer!
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?
!
Yeah, fuck you!
Weren't you my friend?
You know, I'm still your friend!
I'm totally your friend, but you can be a little cruel!
I've been there.
I remember.
That's low.
You and I dated for six weeks, it was never gonna go anywhere,
I did us both a favor.
It's just...
Tina's hurting.
And I would kind of like my place back.
Someday.
Well, I'll tell you what, my friend, you can judge me all you want to.
You make me into a pariah, I fucking deserve it.
But don't you dare interfere with my life like that.
- Okay?
Don't cross that line again!
- I didn't mean to cross a line.
I'm sorry!
- To sponsorship.
- To my little girl's brilliant career.
Is this a Skinny Russian?
Well, I knew that was your drink, Sharon.
Mom?
It's - it's actually Tonya that's the brilliant one.
She's the one who locked in the GM deal.
That's just the beginning.
Sharon, Irwin, do you realize ... what an impact Dana can have?
Because she's - well, because she's beautiful.
Because she looks like the beautiful girl next door.
I think Dana's pretty near perfect.
Dana and your wife: two perfect examples of strength balanced by femininity.
Sharon, Irwin...
Dana and I have something we'd like to ask you.
No, I'm sorry, you cannot have the Tiffany lamps until Daddy and I are ready to downsize.
Well, you know that we've set a date.
We'd really like your blessing.
I don't know what difference that makes.
It would mean a lot.
Mom.
You know, I...
I really don't understand.
I mean, look at you two.
Both of you such pretty girls!
And neither of you would have any trouble finding a man.
We don't want to find a man, Mom.
God!
- Dana
- No!
It's just frustrating, you know!
I
- I try to tell you guys, and you just don't listen!
It's okay.
Sharon, I was engaged once before.
I
- I don't know if Dana told you.
No, no she didn't.
Well... his name was Bayard.
He was smart and successful - he was a real estate lawyer.
He was totally in love with me.
Now, I tried really hard to make that one work.
But every night I would wake up in the middle of the night, crying.
And one night, Bayard woke up and he found me like that.
- Do you know what he did?
- Damned if I do.
He got down on one knee and he said,...
"Tonya, will you not marry me?"
"Because I know what's in your heart."
"And I love you too much to make you unhappy."
"Be true to yourself, Tonya.
Follow your heart."
Am I really saving the environment if I am ordering an Awesome?
Not if it's spills in your Prius.
Hi, I'm gonna try that toffee nut caramel soy frappuccino drink.
No, no, no, no.
No.
Tonya ordered it yesterday, it was lethal.
- Too bad she didn't keel over and die.
- Al...
Oh, I'm sorry, was that too brutally frank and honest for you?
I don't know you guys, I don't trust her...
- ..and I hope Dana gets a pre-nup.
- She should go see Joyce Wischnia
What?
Don't get me involved in that.
Bette totally reams me for uh, suggesting Tina see a lawyer.
Well, I can't blame her.
Sorry, Tina.
Look, I've been taking care of people my whole life.
It's about time I started to take care of myself.
That's why I need a lawyer.
Yeah, but... poor Bette.
Well, she's not exactly an innocent party.
I know, but... you know, getting a lawyer means that things will get ugly.
Couldn't you just try to...
work it out together?
Bette and I need to be on equal footing before there is any chance... ..that we could work anything out.
I need my autonomy.
I don't think I wrote very well yesterday, and I think that Madame Birch didn't really like me.
She's probably jealous because you're so gifted.
And hot.
Of course.
Come on.
Come meet my friends.
Today's the day.
You're gonna love Ling-Ling.
- Okay.
Okay now, Ling-Ling...
- Yeah.
... is...
- the graphic designer!
Right?
- Actually, not quite.
- Ling-Ling's seven months old.
- Okay.
- Her mom, Claudia, is the graphic designer.
- Right.
- And her other mother, Margaret, is the geriatric nurse.
- Right.
- Right?
- Right.
Right.
Alright.
- And they have, um, an adopted Chinese baby.
- Yeah.
Okay, who else?
Uh, is it - is it all gonna be couples today?
Yeah.
Yeah, most of my friends are married.
They sort of, um, took care of me after, you know,
Claybourne and I broke up.
They were really happy when I met you.
Does she know that we - we're having coffee?
She's in Newport Beach with her family.
No, she doesn't know, but I'm not
- I'm not hiding it.
So.
Well if she's at the beach, we could have just met at your place,
..like the good ol' days.
But... we have rules and we're trying to follow them.
Does that mean that you're finding...
it... a li - difficult...
No.
No, not at all, you?
Piece of cake.
Come on Ling-Ling.
Come on, say your word.
Come on Ling-Ling.
Come on, say your word.
Oh, she just said her first word.
Come on, say your word.
- Do you want to have children, Jenny?
- Oh, gosh.
I
- I
- I
- I don't know.
I don't know.
You know, I
- I just kind of feel like I shouldn't be thinking about it now, you know.
You've got all the time in the world.
Now Robin should probably be the first to get pregnant.
- Nora, what are you doing?
- Well, you gotta get on with it.
Robin's gonna make a great mother, Jenny.
She's a born nurturer.
Yes.
She's a - she's a very kind lady.
It's, uh, a little soon for them to be talking about children, Nora.
Oh, come on, we're lesbians.
We talk about everything.
Yeah and anyway, one of the problems with Claybourne was that they didn't talk enough.
I mean, Robin didn't even know that Clayborne didn't believe in monogamy until the day of the wedding.
Did you know that Claybourne cheated on Robin at their own wedding?
You should have been there.
She was stunning.
We'd like to see her in that tux again.
Thank you very much for the day.
Ah, you're welcome.
Do you want to be alone or...
can I come in?
I don't.
I think that we need to talk.
Okay.
- Talk to me.
- I like you very much.
That's a very bad way to begin a conversation.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm just not ready to be married again.
Well Jen, I haven't asked you to marry me.
Robin, it's so obvious to me, that's what you want.
And I kind of feel like...
I don't know, that you set me up or something.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, they leapt to that conclusion 'cause that's what they want for me.
Ya know?
You can't punish me just because my friends want me to find,
- ..you know, an equitable partner.
- Okay, I'm
- I'm not trying to punish you.
Look, Robin, I'm just realizing that, um, I need to...
I
- I just need to be alone right now.
Jen, you can have time alone.
You don't have to be with me every second.
Okay, um... uh...
I need to try and be self-sufficient.
Well, I've never really been on my own before... and...
I think that I need to just...
to feel scared.
There's nothing to be scared of.
- I
- I'm not a scary person.
- Oh Robin, come on.
I mean I'm
- I'm so - I'm terrified of being on my own.
I just gotta make myself do it, Robin, and I can't -
I can't distract myself by creating all this fucking labyrinth-like drama that I'm so good at creating and I promise you... that you do not want to get sucked into my fucking bullshit.
You know what?
Don't.
Okay?
Don't - don't tell me what I want and don't want.
- I know what I fucking want.
- Okay, well I'm gonna speak for myself.
- Please.
- This is uh - this is what I want.
I can't believe you're doing this.
I...
I can't go through this again.
I don't know Robin, that's why I'm saying we should stop now before we actually go through anything.
Can I ask you something?
Did I blow it by taking you to meet my friends today?
No.
I think that your friends seem like really good people.
And they seem, uh... very mature and very um... settled in their life.
So, um... you don't want to be in a relationship?
No, I don't.
- You just wanna sleep with people.
Make them fall in love with you, o you can fuck with their heads.
- No, that's not what I want.
- Well, that's what you did.
Great.
That's why I think we should end this right now before...
I disappoint you any more than I obviously have.
Hello?
This is she.
I don't think that women, especially lesbians, should exploit other women.
Well, the strippers I know do it because they love it.
Wait a minute, haven't you ever had a lap dance?
Is there anyone else here who hasn't had a lap dance?
Oh, my innocent little sweetie!
Would you like one?
That would be okay with you?
Well, if Dana wanted one.
But she doesn't want anyone else's booty in her booty right now.
Do ya, Pookie?
Woah.
What?
Just
- Dana!
She's getting married!
Hey.
I'm just picking up.
I'll be two minutes.
Thanks.
I don't think I want the first woman to ever touch me other than Bette...
- ... to be a stripper.
- Did I hear what I think I just heard?
Bette's the only woman you've ever been with?
You heard it right, missus.
We are getting you a lap dance tonight.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Hey Bette.
Bette!
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Wait, wait.
This sucks.
Yeah, this sucks.
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go meet Kit, so...
I'm just uh...
I'm just sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Thanks.
- Whaddaya think, huh?
- I think it's hideous.
Well, they're all different, you know?
Some have real boobies.
Keep looking, I'm sure you'll see some you like.
C'mon, honey.
It's good fun.
C'mon.
Well, maybe we can get Mister Ferrer to give you more time.
I can go to the bank with you and we can try again.
- Try what?
- Try to get them to lend you the full amount.
I can put up some artwork as collateral.
No, I can't have you do that, it's too much.
You're already putting yourself on the line.
You know, I wouldn't be doing this if I thought I was gonna lose my shirt, okay?
Thank you.
That means the world to me.
I don't think Marina's daddy's gonna give us a break.
He sounds like he wants to get this over with fast.
Hey there, good lookin'.
Can I get ya anything to drink?
Thanks.
Well... can I offer you anything else?
I've got a lot to offer.
I'm with my friends, but maybe later.
Maybe later.
You're a player, right?
Right.
Yeah.
- Oh, sorry.
- What are you doing here?
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- You have to get out, that's against the rules.
- No, I have to go to the bathroom, Al.
- Are you three?
Can't you hold it for a minute?
No.
Fine.
Fine.
Go on.
Go on.
You guys!
Hurry up!
Tina's found someone she likes, I think.
- Wow!
That's exciting!
C'mere!
We gotta be quick.
- Jesus, is that him?
- Count Dracula rides a Hog?
Excellent.
Maybe he's more down-to-earth than I thought.
- Ladies.
- Ivan...
what are you doing here
I have a cashier's check for $50,000 dollars, I'm coming in as your partner.
- Oh, Ivan...
It's a business arrangement, Kit.
Straight up.
I'm in because I like this plan.
I'm your silent partner.
I have nothing to do with your day-to-day.
Okay?
I don't need to hear from you, I won't be hanging around.
I see a statement once a month.
- But Ivan -
- That's how it's gotta be.
If you want it.
Good luck.
So you wanna tell me what's going on?
I dunno, supposedly Tina found a girl she likes.
No, I mean with you and Dana.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Are you guys getting it on yet, or what?
No!
Okay.
Okay.
We kissed!
How'd you figure...
does anyone else know?
- Doubt it.
- You're a freak, you know that, Shane?
Check it out.
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Hi.
You go, girl.
Give her some encouragement, T.
Do you notice anything about her?
Yeah, she looks a little bit like Bette.
I am Manfredi de la Francesco Ferrer.
Si?
Oh, si, buonasera Count
- Manfredi.
Si.
I don't have a lot of time, so just show me what I need to know.
The money is in place?
I want a glass of wine.
Uh, red or white?
Red.
French or Italian.
Not one of those California abominations.
Well I've heard that California wines are pretty good these days.
I hate Los Angeles.
I don't know why Marina came here.
This is a loan for $75,000 dollars, with a contingency.
Si?
Uh, si, yes.
I have here $50,000 dollars in a cashier's check.
I think Marina felt she had a home here.
She had a lot of good friends.
Bullshit.
Who are you?
Which one is Kit Porter?
- I am.
- And you are?
Bette Porter.
- Ahh.
Si.
You're the one.
- The one what?
Such judges, you Americans.
You sit in judgment on the whole world.
Who gave you this power to judge?
Now, wait a minute your highness, or whatever you would like for us to call you -
Are you really such an exemplary person?
Are you perfect, are you better than anyone else?
No.
No, I'm not.
You're so conventional, you Americans.
Thinking one style of life is better than another?
- We have so many ways.
- Look, I know that I judged Marina too harshly,
- but that doesn't give you the right -
- The heart is stronger than the head.
Remember.
And everyone is capable to commit a passionate crime.
And everyone deserves the compassion to start again.
Amen to that.
So how is your daughter, is she okay?
- My daughter?
- Marina.
Marina is not my daughter.
We are married twelve years.
Marina is my wife!
And she is in a hospital in Milano, and no thanks to your friendship.
Everything looks here to be in order.
My people will call you to conclude the business.
Hey.
Hey.
So what did you all do?
Nothing much.
We just hung out.
I'm glad you called me.
I was... feeling pretty lonely.
- Do you want one?
- No thanks.
Tina hired a lawyer, you know.
Yeah, I heard.
How did I let this get so fucked up, Shane?
- Shit's not always in our control.
- I used to think that it was.
I learned early on that if you want to avoid that big mess.
that sucks and fucks with your life... you just keep it simple.
You mean like sex with no emotional entanglements?
Right.
That's just me.
I don't think that applies to you, you're a... very well-rounded individual.
I don't know.
I think...
I just might like to study at your feet, Shane.
Hey.
Hey!
Who's that?
Oh hey!
C'mon over and have a beer with us.
Okay.
Hello.
Hey.
We were just talking about sex with no emotional entanglements.
I like the sound of that.
It's not for everyone.
You know what?
With the day that I've had,
..that sounds like that's for me.
- Cheers.
- Catching up on current events or something?
Yes.
These are all the local newspapers... ..with people advertising for roommates.
I just put this ad in Craigslist, looking for a roommate.
- I hope that I don't get a bunch of crazies.
- So, you're looking for a roommate.
Yeah.
I don't even know...
how to screen people,
.. or what I should ask in rent.
- Would they get their own room?
- Yeah, yeah, it's like ... ..it's a two-bedroom house.
We should talk.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Why not, right?
- Yeah!
- Alright.
Why are you laughing?
Wing
Children, children, we have a very special announcement.
Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing!
Well let's give him a hand!
Token sings?
Of course he sings.
He's black.
Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver.
And for doing it he's gonna be paid 200 dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.
Wow, two hundred dollars.
Can you imagine?
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
That's right.
We're not talented.
See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
Yeah.
We're too smart to be talented.
Wait, you guys!
I just had an amazing idea.
Token is going right to the top, right.
I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
- Probably.
- So, why shouldn't we get some of that money?
We can be Token's agents.
That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Hey yeah!
We deserve that money just as much as he does.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits.
A and a fountain in our lobby.
All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies.
We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.
*Super Awesome Talent Agency* Are You Talented and Need Representation?
STOP BY OUR OFFICES AT:
345 ave de las Mexicano
He's looking at the sign.
Perfect!
All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
All right.
Wait a minute!
You guys, this is very important:
when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important.
When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
It's genius.
Okay, go go, here he comes.
Well then tell him we're just not interested.
Oh hey, Token!
Buddy, my man, what is up?
!
Nothin.
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency.
You may have seen our ads around town.
Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token?
Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
This will only take a second.
Welcome to our offices, Token.
As you can see, we are quite a successful company.
Did you notice the fountain?
Pretty nice, hm?
Come on over this way, Token.
Guys, you remember Token.
He's thinking about becoming a client.
Token.
Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself:
You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency?
Why should I give them ten percent?"
Right?
...Yeah?
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.
Excuse me just a second, Token.
Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh yes, hello!
How are you, Abraham Lincoln?
Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
Can I talk to you?
!
I'll I'll call you back, Abe.
What the hell are you doing?
!
I'm making it look like important people call us.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
...well Token doesn't know that.
Yes he does!
How?
!
Token actually pays attention in school!
Unlike you, fatass!
Jew!
You guys, we're gonna lose our client.
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys.
Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.
Ah, now, where were we?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
Look, Token, here's the bottom line.
You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions.
A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own.
Nobody can.
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie...
They all have agents.
You need somebody to manage it all for you.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token.
With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
All right.
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?
Welcome to the team, Token.
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token.
You just do all the singing, all the performing all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
The Miss Colorado Pageant
And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado.
Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest,
Token Black.
You'll never find...
As long as you live...
Someone who loves you...
Tender like I do...
Wow, he's really great.
We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah
Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
We represent Token.
Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby But I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else!
Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.
Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.
You were awesome, Token!
We knew you could do it!
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great!
And ten percent of two hundred is...
Twenty dollars.
Here you go.
- All right!
- Sweet!
This is just the beginning.
I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
Hey there my man, that was a great performance.
Thanks.
Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles.
I think you've got real promise.
How'd you like to sign with CAA?
Are you serious?
Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Mm, no
Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away.
If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through.
Oh my God!
Okay!
Token, you signed with us!
Oh, come on, guys.
You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
What?
!
Uh they're not so great!
They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.
Mister, you can't do this to us!
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?
Do you like steak, Token?
I know a great place for you locally.
...Goddamnit!
So unfair... so unfair.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?
!
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off!
I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!
Hello, is this the Talent Agency.

Oh, excuse me, everyone.
That's my cell phone.
Hello?
Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders!
Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.

Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Naw, this is better.
It's called The Contender.
What's "The Contender"?
Tonight, two people will compete for glory.
One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.
- Hello.
- The Contender!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender!
Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico,
Manuelo Furrrrnanda!
Le's go!
Le's see a good fight!
And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!
- Come on, Wing!
- Let's do it Wing!
Brint it on Wing!
Oh my God, dude!
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.
Anyone?
Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.
Hey kid!
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
- Oh, thanks.
- Yo kid.
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.
He really likes her voice.
You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, it brings tears to his eyes.
Thanks, Mr. Stallone.
We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
You do?
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
4.000$ ?
!
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp.
And don't be late.
We won't!
You guys, you guys!
What?
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow!
He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Get out!
That's four hundred for us!
We did it!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
Who?
Who?
Who who?
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ..
where's Wing?
What do you mean?
We thought she was with you.
Naw, sh-she was with you!
...Oh Jesus Christ.
If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Wing?
Wing?
- WING!
- Here, Wing!
You thought you could run from us, did you?
Oh no!
Hey!
That's our client!
They did it to us again!
That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Not this time!
They dropped their card.
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is!
We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away.
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves.
It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us.
249A - all right, this is the place.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Of course it's impressive!
They steal everyone else's clients!
It's just four little boys.
Yeah, whatever.
You can suck our balls.
Hello?
We want to talk to somebody right now!
Oh my God, you guys.
Look!
They do have an amazing fountain.
You assholes stole our client!
How about some Goddamn business ethics?
!
You tell 'em, Kyle!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't!
Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
What the hell is that?
!
Go!
Go!
Dude, maybe we should give up!
No!
Screw that, dude!
If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!
CARTMAN!
Do you wanna play rough?
!
Okay!
Take this!
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
All right, Kenny, let's go!
Kenny?
KENNY!
Don't worry, Kenny.
You didn't die for nothing.
We're gonna get Wing back as our client and...
and make a ton of money!
I swear it to you!
They killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Enough!
I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here.
But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
Don't give us that crap!
She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money!
We know because we're in the same business you are!
This woman has a contract with us!
We own her!
She had a contract with us first!
We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Her life belongs to us!
Guys!
Guys!
Guys!
Don't you see what we're doing?
Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person.
I mean, look at what we've all become.
All this violence and anger and, and for what?
For control over somebody's life who...
w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Yeah.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.
We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Perhaps... you're right.
We spend all this time...
mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
Yeah.
It's not a very satisfying feeling.
I am tired of this business.
It is a very dirty and perverse business.
It's a lousy business.
I quit.
Me too.
Aw aw guys, come on!
We quit too.
It's time for us to find another way to make money.
From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
All right!
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding.
And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of...
Wing!
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.
You rearry helped us out.
Yes, you were right, kids.
Her voice is so beautiful.
To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Send a cress in your plates, folks?
Token?
Oh...
Hey guys.
What, what are you doin' here?
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Yeah.
Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.
I'm trying to work my way back home.
Aw man, that's too bad, Token.
Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh?
Oh and some more olive oil.
Chop chop!
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.
Wing
Children, children, we have a very special announcement.
Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing!
Well let's give him a hand!
Token sings?
Of course he sings.
He's black.
Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver.
And for doing it he's gonna be paid 200 dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.
Wow, two hundred dollars.
Can you imagine?
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
That's right.
We're not talented.
See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
Yeah.
We're too smart to be talented.
Wait, you guys!
I just had an amazing idea.
Token is going right to the top, right.
I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
- Probably.
- So, why shouldn't we get some of that money?
We can be Token's agents.
That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Hey yeah!
We deserve that money just as much as he does.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits.
A and a fountain in our lobby.
All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies.
We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.

Perfect!
All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
All right.
Wait a minute!
You guys, this is very important:
when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important.
When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
It's genius.
Okay, go go, here he comes.
Well then tell him we're just not interested.
Oh hey, Token!
Buddy, my man, what is up?
!
Nothin.
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency.
You may have seen our ads around town.
Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token?
Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
This will only take a second.
Welcome to our offices, Token.
As you can see, we are quite a successful company.
Did you notice the fountain?
Pretty nice, hm?
Come on over this way, Token.
Guys, you remember Token.
He's thinking about becoming a client.
Token.
Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself:
You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency?
Why should I give them ten percent?"
Right?
...Yeah?
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.
Excuse me just a second, Token.
Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh yes, hello!
How are you, Abraham Lincoln?
Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
Can I talk to you?
!
I'll I'll call you back, Abe.
What the hell are you doing?
!
I'm making it look like important people call us.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
...well Token doesn't know that.
Yes he does!
How?
!
Token actually pays attention in school!
Unlike you, fatass!
Jew!
You guys, we're gonna lose our client.
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys.
Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.
Ah, now, where were we?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
Look, Token, here's the bottom line.
You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions.
A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own.
Nobody can.
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie...
They all have agents.
You need somebody to manage it all for you.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token.
With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
All right.
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?
Welcome to the team, Token.
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token.
You just do all the singing, all the performing all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
The Miss Colorado Pageant

Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
We represent Token.
Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby But I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else!
Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.
Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.
You were awesome, Token!
We knew you could do it!
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great!
And ten percent of two hundred is...
Twenty dollars.
Here you go.
- All right!

This is just the beginning.
I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
Hey there my man, that was a great performance.
Thanks.
Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles.
I think you've got real promise.
How'd you like to sign with CAA?
Are you serious?
Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Mm, no
Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away.
If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through.
Oh my God!
Okay!
Token, you signed with us!
Oh, come on, guys.
You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
What?
!
Uh they're not so great!
They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.
Mister, you can't do this to us!
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?
Do you like steak, Token?
I know a great place for you locally.
...Goddamnit!
So unfair... so unfair.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?
!
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off!
I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!

Excuse me, ma'am.
Wait in line with everyone else.
No, I don't think you understand.
We're here with Wing.
That's right, the Wing.
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency.
If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
Oh, excuse me, everyone.
That's my cell phone.
Hello?
Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders!
Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
Aw, just forget it!
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders!
You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
Goddamnit!
Goddamnit!
We can't wait in line!
We have to be in school on Monday!
Stupid assholes!
What do you mean your client isn't coming?

We're taping the show tomorrow!

Fine!
Go screw yourself!
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?

Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
Well yeah, winner gets a 1 000 dollars.
All right, our client will do it!
Great!
You kids just saved my ass!
See you over at Stage 6.
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Naw, this is better.
It's called The Contender.
What's "The Contender"?
Tonight, two people will compete for glory.
One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.
- Hello.
- The Contender!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender!
Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico,
Manuelo Furrrrnanda!
Le's go!
Le's see a good fight!
And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!
- Come on, Wing!
- Let's do it Wing!
Brint it on Wing!
Oh my God, dude!
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.
Anyone?
Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.
Hey kid!
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
- Oh, thanks.
- Yo kid.
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.
He really likes her voice.
You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, it brings tears to his eyes.
Thanks, Mr. Stallone.
We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
You do?
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
4.000$ ?
!
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp.
And don't be late.
We won't!
You guys, you guys!
What?
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow!
He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Get out!
That's four hundred for us!
We did it!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
Who?
Who?
Who who?
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ..
where's Wing?
What do you mean?
We thought she was with you.
Naw, sh-she was with you!
...Oh Jesus Christ.
If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Wing?
Wing?
- WING!
- Here, Wing!
You thought you could run from us, did you?
Oh no!
Hey!
That's our client!
They did it to us again!
That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Not this time!
They dropped their card.
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is!
We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away.
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves.
It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us.
249A - all right, this is the place.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Of course it's impressive!
They steal everyone else's clients!
It's just four little boys.
Yeah, whatever.
You can suck our balls.
Hello?
We want to talk to somebody right now!
Oh my God, you guys.
Look!
They do have an amazing fountain.
You assholes stole our client!
How about some Goddamn business ethics?
!
You tell 'em, Kyle!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't!
Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
What the hell is that?
!
Go!
Go!
Dude, maybe we should give up!
No!
Screw that, dude!
If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!
CARTMAN!
Do you wanna play rough?
!
Okay!
Take this!
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
All right, Kenny, let's go!
Kenny?
KENNY!
Don't worry, Kenny.
You didn't die for nothing.
We're gonna get Wing back as our client and...
and make a ton of money!
I swear it to you!
They killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Enough!
I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here.
But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
Don't give us that crap!
She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money!
We know because we're in the same business you are!
This woman has a contract with us!
We own her!
She had a contract with us first!
We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Her life belongs to us!
Guys!
Guys!
Guys!
Don't you see what we're doing?
Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person.
I mean, look at what we've all become.
All this violence and anger and, and for what?
For control over somebody's life who...
w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Yeah.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.
We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Perhaps... you're right.
We spend all this time...
mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
Yeah.
It's not a very satisfying feeling.
I am tired of this business.
It is a very dirty and perverse business.
It's a lousy business.
I quit.
Me too.
Aw aw guys, come on!
We quit too.
It's time for us to find another way to make money.
From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
All right!
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding.
And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of...
Wing!
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.
You rearry helped us out.
Yes, you were right, kids.
Her voice is so beautiful.
To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Send a cress in your plates, folks?
Token?
Oh...
Hey guys.
What, what are you doin' here?
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Yeah.
Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.
I'm trying to work my way back home.
Aw man, that's too bad, Token.
Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh?
Oh and some more olive oil.
Chop chop!
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.

Children, children, we have a very special announcement.
Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing!
Well let's give him a hand!
Token sings?
Of course he sings.
He's black.
Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver.
And for doing it he's gonna be paid 200 dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.
Wow, two hundred dollars.
Can you imagine?
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
That's right.
We're not talented.
See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
Yeah.
We're too smart to be talented.
Wait, you guys!
I just had an amazing idea.
Token is going right to the top, right.
I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
- Probably.
- So, why shouldn't we get some of that money?
We can be Token's agents.
That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Hey yeah!
We deserve that money just as much as he does.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits.
A and a fountain in our lobby.
All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies.
We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.
*Super Awesome Talent Agency* Are You Talented and Need Representation?

He's looking at the sign.
Perfect!
All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
All right.
Wait a minute!
You guys, this is very important:
when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important.
When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.

She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.
Anyone?
Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.
Hey kid!
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
- Oh, thanks.
- Yo kid.
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.
He really likes her voice.
You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, it brings tears to his eyes.
Thanks, Mr. Stallone.
We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
You do?
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
4.000$ ?
!
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp.
And don't be late.
We won't!
You guys, you guys!
What?
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow!
He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Get out!
That's four hundred for us!
We did it!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
Who?
Who?
Who who?
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ..
where's Wing?
What do you mean?
We thought she was with you.
Naw, sh-she was with you!
...Oh Jesus Christ.
If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Wing?
Wing?
- WING!
- Here, Wing!
You thought you could run from us, did you?
Oh no!
Hey!
That's our client!
They did it to us again!
That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Not this time!
They dropped their card.
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is!
We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away.
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves.
It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us.
249A - all right, this is the place.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Of course it's impressive!
They steal everyone else's clients!
It's just four little boys.
Yeah, whatever.
You can suck our balls.
Hello?
We want to talk to somebody right now!
Oh my God, you guys.
Look!
They do have an amazing fountain.
You assholes stole our client!
How about some Goddamn business ethics?
!
You tell 'em, Kyle!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't!
Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
What the hell is that?
!
Go!
Go!
Dude, maybe we should give up!
No!
Screw that, dude!
If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!
CARTMAN!
Do you wanna play rough?
!
Okay!
Take this!
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
All right, Kenny, let's go!
Kenny?
KENNY!
Don't worry, Kenny.
You didn't die for nothing.
We're gonna get Wing back as our client and...
and make a ton of money!
I swear it to you!
They killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Enough!
I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here.
But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
Don't give us that crap!
She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money!
We know because we're in the same business you are!
This woman has a contract with us!
We own her!
She had a contract with us first!
We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Her life belongs to us!
Guys!
Guys!
Guys!
Don't you see what we're doing?
Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person.
I mean, look at what we've all become.
All this violence and anger and, and for what?
For control over somebody's life who...
w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Yeah.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.
We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Perhaps... you're right.
We spend all this time...
mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
Yeah.
It's not a very satisfying feeling.
I am tired of this business.
It is a very dirty and perverse business.
It's a lousy business.
I quit.
Me too.
Aw aw guys, come on!
We quit too.
It's time for us to find another way to make money.
From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
All right!
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding.
And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of...
Wing!
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.
You rearry helped us out.
Yes, you were right, kids.
Her voice is so beautiful.
To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Send a cress in your plates, folks?
Token?
Oh...
Hey guys.
What, what are you doin' here?
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Yeah.
Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.
I'm trying to work my way back home.
Aw man, that's too bad, Token.
Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh?
Oh and some more olive oil.
Chop chop!
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.
Children, children, we have a very special announcement.
Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing!
Well let's give him a hand!
Token sings?
Of course he sings.
He's black.
Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver.
And for doing it he's gonna be paid 200 dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.
Wow, two hundred dollars.
Can you imagine?
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
That's right.
We're not talented.
See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
Yeah.
We're too smart to be talented.
Wait, you guys!
I just had an amazing idea.
Token is going right to the top, right.
I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
- Probably.
- So, why shouldn't we get some of that money?
We can be Token's agents.
That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Hey yeah!
We deserve that money just as much as he does.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits.
A and a fountain in our lobby.
All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies.
We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.
*Super Awesome Talent Agency* Are You Talented and Need Representation?
STOP BY OUR OFFICES AT:
345 ave de las Mexicano
He's looking at the sign.
Perfect!
All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
All right.
Wait a minute!
You guys, this is very important:
when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important.
When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
It's genius.
Okay, go go, here he comes.
Well then tell him we're just not interested.
Oh hey, Token!
Buddy, my man, what is up?
!
Nothin.
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency.
You may have seen our ads around town.
Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token?
Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
This will only take a second.
Welcome to our offices, Token.
As you can see, we are quite a successful company.
Did you notice the fountain?
Pretty nice, hm?
Come on over this way, Token.
Guys, you remember Token.
He's thinking about becoming a client.
Token.
Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself:
You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency?
Why should I give them ten percent?"
Right?
...Yeah?
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.
Excuse me just a second, Token.
Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh yes, hello!
How are you, Abraham Lincoln?
Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
Can I talk to you?
!
I'll I'll call you back, Abe.
What the hell are you doing?
!
I'm making it look like important people call us.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
...well Token doesn't know that.
Yes he does!
How?
!
Token actually pays attention in school!
Unlike you, fatass!
Jew!
You guys, we're gonna lose our client.
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys.
Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.
Ah, now, where were we?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
Look, Token, here's the bottom line.
You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions.
A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own.
Nobody can.
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie...
They all have agents.
You need somebody to manage it all for you.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token.
With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
All right.
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?
Welcome to the team, Token.
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token.
You just do all the singing, all the performing all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
The Miss Colorado Pageant
And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado.
Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest,
Token Black.
You'll never find...
As long as you live...
Someone who loves you...
Tender like I do...
Wow, he's really great.
We should get him to sing at Tommy's bar mitzvah
Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
We represent Token.
Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
Whoa, I'm not braggin' on myself, baby But I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else!
Just between us girls, nothin' gets my vadge wetter than a black man singing.
Mr. Garrison, for the love of God.
You were awesome, Token!
We knew you could do it!
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great!
And ten percent of two hundred is...
Twenty dollars.
Here you go.
- All right!
- Sweet!
This is just the beginning.
I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
Hey there my man, that was a great performance.
Thanks.
Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles.
I think you've got real promise.
How'd you like to sign with CAA?
Are you serious?
Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Mm, no
Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away.
If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through.
Oh my God!
Okay!
Token, you signed with us!
Oh, come on, guys.
You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
What?
!
Uh they're not so great!
They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.
Mister, you can't do this to us!
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?
Do you like steak, Token?
I know a great place for you locally.
...Goddamnit!
So unfair... so unfair.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?
!
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off!
I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!

Hey there my man, that was a great performance.
Thanks.
Don Heisman, Creative Arts Agency in Los Angeles.
I think you've got real promise.
How'd you like to sign with CAA?
Are you serious?
Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
You may have heard of Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Mm, no.
Uh, look, Token, there's some shows in LA we wanna book you on right away.
If you come out to my limo we can talk everything through.
Oh my God!
Okay!
Token, you signed with us!
Oh, come on, guys.
You have to see what a huge opportunity this is for me.
What?

Uh they're not so great!
They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.
Mister, you can't do this to us!
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?
Do you like steak, Token I know a great place for you locally.
...Goddamnit!
So unfair... so unfair.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?
!
This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off!
I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!
Ahh hello, is this the Talent Agency

Hey, you just sit and listen.
You'll be very impressed.
Well?
What you think?
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
Aww, that's too bad.
She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres, but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant.
You've ...already done all the work?
Yes.
They say it pays a thousand dowrar.
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.

You were to pay us ten thousand dollars for that service.
Yet, we have yet to be paid.

It's too late for that, Mr. Kim.

No, she... she not here!
Prease, just give me a little more time!
Where is she?

Oh crap!
Dude, how long is the wait?
It's been about seventeen days for me.
Oh no, nonono, come on!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Wait in line with everyone else.
No, I don't think you understand.
We're here with Wing.
That's right, the Wing.
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency.
If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
Oh, excuse me, everyone.
That's my cell phone.
Hello?
Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders!
Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
Aw, just forget it!
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders!
You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
Goddamnit!
Goddamnit!
We can't wait in line!
We have to be in school on Monday!
Stupid assholes!
What do you mean your client isn't coming?
!
We're taping the show tomorrow!
Where am I goin' to find another contestant?
Fine!
Go screw yourself!
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
Really?
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
Well yeah, winner gets a thousand dollars.
All right, our client will do it!
Great!
You kids just saved my ass!
See you over at Stage 6.
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Naw, this is better.
It's called The Contender.
"What's ""The Contender""?"
Tonight, two people will compete for glory.
One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.
Hello.
The Contender!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender!
Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico, Manuelo Furrrrnanda!
Le's go!
Le's see a good fight!
And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!
-Come on, Wing!
-Let's do it Wing!
-Brint it on Wing!
Oh my God, dude!
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.
Gay.
Anyone?
Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.
Hey kid!
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
Oh, thanks.
Yo kid.
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.
He really likes her voice.
You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, it brings tears to his eyes.
Thanks, Mr. Stallone.
We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
You do?
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
Four thousand dollars?
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp.
And don't be late.
We won't!
-You guys, you guys!
-What?
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow!
He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
-(What?
!
)
-Get out!
That's four hundred for us!
We did it!
-Who let the dogs out?
-Who?
Who?
Who who?
-Who let-?
-Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing?
What do you mean?
We thought she was with you.
Naw, sh-she was with you!
...Oh Jesus Christ.
If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Wing?
Wing?
You thought you could run from us, did you?
Oh no!
Hey!
That's our client!
They did it to us again!
That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Not this time!
They dropped their card.
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is!
We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away.
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves.
It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us.
Two four nine all right, this is the place.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Of course it's impressive!
They steal everyone else's clients!
"""It's just four little boys"""
Yeah, whatever.
You can suck our balls.
Hello?
We want to talk to somebody right now!
Oh my God, you guys.
Look!
They do have an amazing fountain.
You assholes stole our client!
How about some Goddamn business ethics?
!
You tell 'em, Kyle!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't!
Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
What the hell is that?
!
Go!
Go!
Dude, maybe we should give up!
No!
Screw that, dude!
If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!
Cartman!
Do you wanna play rough?
!
Okay!
Take this!
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
All right, Kenny, let's go!
Kenny?
!
Kenny!
Don't worry, Kenny.
You didn't die for nothing.
We're gonna get Wing back as our client and...
and make a ton of money!
I swear it to you
They killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Enough!
I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here.
But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
Don't give us that crap!
She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money!
We know because we're in the same business you are!
This woman has a contract with us!
We own her!
She had a contract with us first!
We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Her life belongs to us!
Guys!
Guys!
Guys!
Don't you see what we're doing?
Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person.
I mean, look at what we've all become.
All this violence and anger and, and for what?
For control over somebody's life who...
w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Yeah.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.
We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Perhaps... you're right.
We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
Yeah.
It's not a very satisfying feeling.
I am tired of this business.
It is a very dirty and perverse business.
It's a lousy business.
I quit.
Me too.
Aw aw guys, come on!
We quit too.
It's time for us to find another way to make money.
From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
All right!
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding.
And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of...
Wing!
Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long...
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.
You rearry helped us out.
Yes, you were right, kids.
Her voice is so beautiful.
To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Send a cress in your plates, folks?
Token?
Oh...
Hey guys.
What, what are you doin' here?
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Yeah.
Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.
I'm trying to work my way back home.
Aw man, that's too bad, Token.
Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh?
Oh and some more olive oil.
Chop chop!
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.
Sing, sing a song.
Children, children, we have a very special announcement.
Your classmate,
Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing!
Well let's give him a hand!
Token sings?
Of course he sings.
He's black.
Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado
Pageant in Denver.
And for doing it he's gonna be paid two hundred dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.
Wow, two hundred dollars.
Can you imagine?
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
That's right.
We're not talented.
See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
Yeah.
We're too smart to be talented.
Wait, you guys!
I just had an amazing idea.
Token is going right to the top, right.
I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
Probably.
So, why shouldn't we get some of that money?
We can be Token's agents.
That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Hey yeah!
We deserve that money just as much as he does.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits.
A and a fountain in our lobby.
All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies.
We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.
He's looking at the sign.
Perfect!
All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
All right.
Wait a minute!
You guys, this is very important:
when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important.
When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
It's genius.
Okay, go go, here he comes.
Yeah?
Well then tell him we're just not interested.
Oh hey, Token!
Buddy, my man, what is up?
!
Nothin'
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency.
You may have seen our ads around town.
Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token?
Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
This will only take a second.
Welcome to our offices, Token.
As you can see, we are quite a successful company.
Did you notice the fountain?
Pretty nice, hm?
Come on over this way, Token.
Guys, you remember Token.
He's thinking about becoming a client.
Oohhhh Token.
Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
"Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself:
You're saying, ""Hey, why do I need an agency?
Why should I give them ten percent?"" Right?"
...Yeah?
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.
Uh uh, excuse me just a second, Token.
Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh yes, hello!
How are you, Abraham Lincoln?
Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
Can I talk to you?
!
I'll I'll call you back, Abe.
What the hell are you doing?
!
I'm making it look like important people call us.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
...well Token doesn't know that.
Yes he does!
How?
!
Token actually pays attention in school!
Unlike you, fatass!
-Jew!
-You guys, we're gonna lose our client.
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys.
Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.
Ah, now, where were we?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
Look, Token, here's the bottom line.
You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions.
A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own.
Nobody can.
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie...
They all have agents.
You need somebody to manage it all for you.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token.
With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
All right.
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?
Welcome to the team, Token.
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
(Hey, terrific!
)
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token.
You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining, and leave the rest to us.
And there are your finalists, the sixteen most beautiful women in Colorado.
Here to sing for our sixteen lucky finalists, the winner of the Colorado Child Star Contest, Token Black.
You'll never find...

You were awesome, Token!
We knew you could do it!
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great!
And ten percent of two hundred is...
Twenty dollars.

If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!
Cartman!
Do you wanna play rough?
!
Okay!
Take this!
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
All right, Kenny, let's go!
Kenny?
!
Kenny!
Don't worry, Kenny.
You didn't die for nothing.
We're gonna get Wing back as our client and...
and make a ton of money!
I swear it to you
They killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Enough!
I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here.
But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
Don't give us that crap!
She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money!
We know because we're in the same business you are!
This woman has a contract with us!
We own her!
She had a contract with us first!
We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Her life belongs to us!
Guys!
Guys!
Guys!
Don't you see what we're doing?
Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person.
I mean, look at what we've all become.
All this violence and anger and, and for what?
For control over somebody's life who...
w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Yeah.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.
We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Perhaps... you're right.
We spend all this time... mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
Yeah.
It's not a very satisfying feeling.
I am tired of this business.
It is a very dirty and perverse business.
It's a lousy business.
I quit.
Me too.
Aw aw guys, come on!
We quit too.
It's time for us to find another way to make money.
From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
All right!
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding.
And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of...
Wing!
Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long...
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.
You rearry helped us out.
Yes, you were right, kids.
Her voice is so beautiful.
To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Send a cress in your plates, folks?
Token?
Oh...
Hey guys.
What, what are you doin' here?
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Yeah.
Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.
I'm trying to work my way back home.
Aw man, that's too bad, Token.
Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh?
Oh and some more olive oil.
Chop chop!
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.
Sing, sing a song.

Children, children, we have a very special announcement.
Your classmate, Token, has just returned from winning the Colorado Child Star Contest with his incredible singing!
Well let's give him a hand!
Token sings?
Of course he sings.
He's black.
Token is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the Miss Colorado Pageant in Denver.
And for doing it he's gonna be paid 200 dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
Now of course, as a woman, I'm a bit against those chauvinistic pageants, but I hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate Token for being so special.
Wow, two hundred dollars.
Can you imagine?
How come we never get opportunities like that?
You wanna know what it is, guys?
We're not talented?
That's right.
We're not talented.
See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
Yeah.
We're too smart to be talented.
Wait, you guys!
I just had an amazing idea.
Token is going right to the top, right.
I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
- Probably.
- So, why shouldn't we get some of that money?
We can be Token's agents.
That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
Hey yeah!
We deserve that money just as much as he does.
We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits.
A and a fountain in our lobby.
All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies.
We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all.
*Super Awesome Talent Agency* Are You Talented and Need Representation?
STOP BY OUR OFFICES AT:
345 ave de las Mexicano
He's looking at the sign.
Perfect!
All right, you guys get back to the office, I'll bring Token there.
All right.
Wait a minute!
You guys, this is very important:
when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
Why?
Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important.
When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
It's genius.
Okay, go go, here he comes.
Well then tell him we're just not interested.
Oh hey, Token!
Buddy, my man, what is up?
!
Nothin.
Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
Yeah.
Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency.
You may have seen our ads around town.
Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token?
Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
I'm supposed to be home by 3:30.
This will only take a second.
Welcome to our offices, Token.
As you can see, we are quite a successful company.
Did you notice the fountain?
Pretty nice, hm?
Come on over this way, Token.
Guys, you remember Token.
He's thinking about becoming a client.
Token.
Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
Now, Token, I I know what you're saying to yourself:
You're saying, "Hey, why do I need an agency?
Why should I give them ten percent?"
Right?
...Yeah?
Token, the truth is that without representation, you're in danger of being taken advantage of.
Excuse me just a second, Token.
Super Awesome Talent Agency.
Oh yes, hello!
How are you, Abraham Lincoln?
Yeahh, yeah, no, I'm happy you called, Abraham Lincoln.
I'm just sort of in the middle of something right now.
Can I talk to you?
!
I'll I'll call you back, Abe.
What the hell are you doing?
!
I'm making it look like important people call us.
Abraham Lincoln has been dead for two hundred years!
...well Token doesn't know that.
Yes he does!
How?
!
Token actually pays attention in school!
Unlike you, fatass!
Jew!
You guys, we're gonna lose our client.
Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys.
Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.
Ah, now, where were we?
We were at why I should give you ten percent.
Look, Token, here's the bottom line.
You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions.
A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own.
Nobody can.
Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie...
They all have agents.
You need somebody to manage it all for you.
This thing in Denver is is just the crust, Token.
With our support, you can have the whole pie.
Well, I guess that makes sense.
All right.
Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here?
Welcome to the team, Token.
Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token.
You just do all the singing, all the performing all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.

We knew you could do it!
Two hundred dollars, Token, that's great!
And ten percent of two hundred is...
Twenty dollars.
Here you go.

Actually, our fountain is two stories tall.
Come on, Token, we have a lot to talk about.
Mister, you can't do this to us!
Sorry kids, nature of the business, you know?
Do you like steak, Token?
I know a great place for you locally.
...Goddamnit!
So unfair... so unfair.
All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?

This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off!
I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on!

Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.
He really likes her voice.
You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, it brings tears to his eyes.
Thanks, Mr. Stallone.
We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.

You thought you could run from us, did you?
Oh no!

Not this time!
They dropped their card.
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is!
We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away.
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves.
It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us.
249A - all right, this is the place.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Of course it's impressive!
They steal everyone else's clients!
It's just four little boys.
Yeah, whatever.
You can suck our balls.
Hello?
We want to talk to somebody right now!
Oh my God, you guys.
Look!
They do have an amazing fountain.
You assholes stole our client!
How about some Goddamn business ethics?

You tell 'em, Kyle!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't!
Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
What the hell is that?
!
Go!
Go!
Dude, maybe we should give up!
No!
Screw that, dude!
If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!
CARTMAN!
Do you wanna play rough?

Okay!
Take this!
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!

Hey, you just sit and listen.
You'll be very impressed.
Well?
What you think?
Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
Aww, that's too bad.
She just got accepted to be on American Idol in Ros Angeres, but I can't take her 'cause I have to mind the restaurant.
You've ...already done all the work?
Yes.
They say it pays a thousand dowrar.
Sir, we would love to sign your wife.

It's been about 17 days for me.
Oh no, nonono, come on!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Wait in line with everyone else.
No, I don't think you understand.
We're here with Wing.
That's right, the Wing.
Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency.
If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
Oh, excuse me, everyone.
That's my cell phone.
Hello?
Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders!
Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
Aw, just forget it!
Eh eh, you're right, Colonel Sanders!
You shouldn't give her any more chicken.
Goddamnit!
Goddamnit!
We can't wait in line!
We have to be in school on Monday!
Stupid assholes!
What do you mean your client isn't coming?
!
We're taping the show tomorrow!
Where am I goin' to find another contestant?
Fine!
Go screw yourself!
Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
Really?
Is there a cash prize involved in your show as well?
Well yeah, winner gets a 1 000 dollars.
All right, our client will do it!
Great!
You kids just saved my ass!
See you over at Stage 6.
Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
Naw, this is better.
It's called The Contender.
What's "The Contender"?
Tonight, two people will compete for glory.
One will stay, one will go home, in the new hit show by Sylvester Stallone.
- Hello.
- The Contender!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Contender!
Fighting out of the red corner, wearing blue and white trunks, the Destructor from Del Fuego, Mexico,
Manuelo Furrrrnanda!
Le's go!
Le's see a good fight!
And fighting out of the blue corner, wearing a gorgeous floral-pattern silk dress, Wing!
- Come on, Wing!
- Let's do it Wing!
Brint it on Wing!
Oh my God, dude!
She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that.
Anyone?
Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
Your gift of hope is a great deduction.
Hey kid!
Mr. Stallone says he's sorry it couldn't go better for you back there.
- Oh, thanks.
- Yo kid.
Mr. Stallone thinks your singer has a lot of talent.
He really likes her voice.
You know, the way she vocalizes the melody, it brings tears to his eyes.
Thanks, Mr. Stallone.
We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer.
Uh, Mr. Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding.
You do?
He'll pay her four thousand dollars.
4.000$ ?
!
Be at this address tomorrow 2 p.m. sharp.
And don't be late.
We won't!
You guys, you guys!
What?
Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow!
He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
Get out!
That's four hundred for us!
We did it!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
- Who Let the Dogs Out?
!
Who?
Who?
Who who?
Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ..
where's Wing?
What do you mean?
We thought she was with you.
Naw, sh-she was with you!
...Oh Jesus Christ.
If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
Wing?
Wing?
- WING!
- Here, Wing!
You thought you could run from us, did you?
Oh no!
Hey!
That's our client!
They did it to us again!
That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
Not this time!
They dropped their card.
Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is!
We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
You see, Mrs. Kim, when you made a deal with us, you signed your life away.
Yes, we help Chinese citizens sneak into the U.S., but when they get here, they become our slaves.
It's an age-old business, and nobody has the guts to stop us.
249A - all right, this is the place.
Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
Of course it's impressive!
They steal everyone else's clients!
It's just four little boys.
Yeah, whatever.
You can suck our balls.
Hello?
We want to talk to somebody right now!
Oh my God, you guys.
Look!
They do have an amazing fountain.
You assholes stole our client!
How about some Goddamn business ethics?
!
You tell 'em, Kyle!
You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't!
Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW!
Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
What the hell is that?
!
Go!
Go!
Dude, maybe we should give up!
No!
Screw that, dude!
If we keep letting CAA take all our clients, we're never gonna make it as talent agents!
Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too!
CARTMAN!
Do you wanna play rough?
!
Okay!
Take this!
We've gotta split up and find Wing!
You and Kenny go that way!
Wing?
Stupid talent agents!
All right, Kenny, let's go!
Kenny?
KENNY!
Don't worry, Kenny.
You didn't die for nothing.
We're gonna get Wing back as our client and...
and make a ton of money!
I swear it to you!
They killed Kenny!
You bastards!
Enough!
I have a lot of respect for you boys finding your way in here.
But you come any closer and I'll blow her brains out.
Don't give us that crap!
She's no good to you dead and you know it!
Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money!
We know because we're in the same business you are!
This woman has a contract with us!
We own her!
She had a contract with us first!
We own her!
Her life belongs to us!
Her life belongs to us!
Guys!
Guys!
Guys!
Don't you see what we're doing?
Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person.
I mean, look at what we've all become.
All this violence and anger and, and for what?
For control over somebody's life who...
w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
Yeah.
Wing doesn't belong to us or to you.
We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
Perhaps... you're right.
We spend all this time...
mooching off the hopes and dreams of others, forgetting that they are human beings.
Yeah.
It's not a very satisfying feeling.
I am tired of this business.
It is a very dirty and perverse business.
It's a lousy business.
I quit.
Me too.
Aw aw guys, come on!
We quit too.
It's time for us to find another way to make money.
From now on, all contracts we have on people are null and void.
All right!
Mr. Stallone thanks all of you for coming to his son's wedding.
And now as a special treat, it is his pleasure to give you the music of...
Wing!
Boys, thank you so much for eveything.
You rearry helped us out.
Yes, you were right, kids.
Her voice is so beautiful.
To think we would have made it so nobody would ever hear her sing.
I think we all learned it's best to leave talent to the talented people.
Send a cress in your plates, folks?
Token?
Oh...
Hey guys.
What, what are you doin' here?
Token, you're... waiting tables?
Yeah.
Well, it turns out an agency doesn't really do anything for you.
I'm trying to work my way back home.
Aw man, that's too bad, Token.
Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh?
Oh and some more olive oil.
Chop chop!
My God, her voice is sooo beautiful!
Yeah, she's a very dericate rittle flower.
Your lunch-box.
Get up!
- My child!
See you.
Bye.
Get up!
Just this much left.
And always chew your food.
Bye sweetheart!
Lunch-box.
A little more.
Rahul...
Rahul... get up.
Go and check the tap for water.
Rahul!
Damn it!
I've given birth to a veritable sleeping giant.
Rahul, are you up already?
Prachi...
Prachi, wake up now...
Prachi!
Pra...
Prachi, don't get in the way now... go and brush your teeth.
Be done with your potty and all... quickly get ready.
God!
This child is really a pain!
Your dada?
- He's asleep!
Was there any need to watch TV all night long?
Get up... go fill some water!
Now who's going to tidy this mess?
- I will...
What do you mean by 'I will'?
Wake up and check if the tanker is already around.
I am not gonna see that!
- No?
What's the meaning of such behaviour?
No sane hour to sleep or wake up... and for, everything just locking horns...
There's no question of locking horns.
I've made it clear...
I am off to Mangya's to study.
- You thump for studies... he'll put forward office, I am the only one who has all the time in the world!
Wake you up, run after you get you ready, get the tiffins ready.
Even I have just two hands like you.
Forget lending a helping hand... no one's decent enough to respond to a call.
It's only me rambling away.
So... here we go.
Now why can't everyone wake up by dawn and do a bit... no way!
I have to be after you even to fold the bed sheets.
It's well-known that water is scant but I must be the one to urge you... to pour a thimbleful on your heads.
With all this chasing and fretting...
I'll kick the bucket sooner than you think.
The milk's gone!
This house's also a cramped hole.
You can't walk from one room to another without banging into something.
Sleep, Ok?
Rahul... why are you sitting around wasting time?
I'll break your face... take the bucket and go get water.
Leave me alone...
- Rahul!
Now, this is the limit!
He's got no feeling, that's for sure... but even if some else makes him aware look at his shamelessness!
Such cheek at this age!
God knows what's in store for the future!
Rahul, don't wear me out... water!
I've already informed you, I gotta go to Mangya's.
I don't care whether you go to Mangya or some other numbskull...
Tidy up your stuff!
Fill water and go wherever you please.
I don't need to issue separate instructions to you.
Get up!
Listen!
Mind being a bit gentle?
You work so roughly... what is this... getting excited is not going to reduce your work.
If you'd only apply yourself to the task calmly you'll save a lot more trouble.
Well, you don't loose anything sitting there and passing judgment.
And why not...?
What's the difference between a house wife and a maid servant?
It's my mistake.
I should have picked up a job and put the kids in the creche.
I should have gotten into the Tiffin business... and everything would have gone on smoothly.
But you wanted me to sit at home and bring them up to be good human beings.
Like a father has no hand in all this... and so I was done in.
I looked after them with great dedication and affection.
But to what avail...?
Our son talks back to me... and all the father does is sit and read the newspaper...
Rahul, go down and get some water.
Baba, I told you I've got to study.
How can you go to someone else's house and study?
I can... and I do it well.
- Great!
But what happens when the results are out?
You've failed in three subjects.
Now let me study...
I know I have failed... but it's not my fault.
What?
If it isn't yours, whose fault is it?
Sure... if it's not his fault, it must be ours.
There must either be a problem with the teacher... or I fell short while brining him up.
The other parents, I mean not even the fathers... even the mothers don't pay any attention.
Even then children pass in all the subjects... and here we are standing in attendance 24 hours... and this is the state of affairs.
I don't attend tuitions of the teacher who teaches the three subjects... that's why I've failed...
everyone who goes for those tuitions passes.
Well, you should have told us this before.
Anyway... from next month start attending those tuitions.
What tuition?
I don't believe in tuition and all... why can't you pay more attention and study properly...?
Or why don't you help him in his studies...
Why her?
If you teach me, the result will still be the same.
Oh, is that so...?
There is no need for any tuition.
Tuitions from the same teacher who teaches you... no way.
I'm not going to pay for this... understood...?
Then I won't pass either.
You don't have money to pay for the tuition?
I never said anything about not having money.
I'm not going to pay for the tuition.
That's all I said.
Why?
- What do you mean why?
This is clearly blackmail.
In a way, it's like giving bribes... and I don't like that at all.
And you know that it doesn't fit with my principles...
Your principles are important or his academic year?
Don't talk like that.
You think I don't understand anything... that I never went to school or that I never passed my exams...
I've been working at the bank for so many years...
I've never taken any such tuitions.
I've never paid one buck extra...
But those were different days.
They're gone.
Now everywhere you see classes going on and children attend them... you think their parents don't have any principles?
I'm thinking about myself.
If ten people decide to make an ass out of themselves...
I should too, just because they're ten?
Don't I stand for anything alone?
What is this?
What does this mean that you'll only pass of you take tuitions?
This isn't education, it's a business... it's better that Rahul doesn't study at all.
What do you care?
Everything is ok with you.
Even the house you live in is ok with you... even though it's on rent.
When you have to pick up the buckets and go, don't you find it frustrating...?
I was insisting my father... that you must notjudge the house by your post in the bank.
Not to get carried away by the fact that Brahmnis live in this neighbourhood.
What happened then?
Nothing has gone wrong.
Everything will be as you desire.
I'm tired of living on such hopes and dreams.
What have I got in the past 15 years...?
Your principles have completely ruined everything for us anyway...
now ruin it for our child also.
And be happy... with your principles.
I'm not going to make it for college again
When is your boss coming?
I'll speak to him.
As if we have no other work.
Why does he do this every time?
What happened... isn't he opening the tap?
God knows.
He always throws some tantrum.
- Look at him.
Why?
What the hell...
What happened, Uncle?
How long will it take?
God knows...
- No idea.
What do you mean no idea?
If you don't know, then who will!
People have been waiting for so long... how can you do something like this?
Open the tap.
Is anyone else saying anything?
Everyone else is standing quietly, aren't they?
I'm addressing you with respect...
you're just a tanker worker.
Everyone pays you... hurry up and open the tap.
The overseer has gone to talk about the money, ok...?
And he's gone with the key.
He's told me he won't give me the keys without receiving any money...
But over here everyone's given money Don't waste time with stupid excuses... otherwise go call the overseer.
Look here, I don't want any trouble early in the morning...
I told you, he's gone to collect his money
You people might be paying on time but we should also get the money on time.
Apte...
Apte...
let it be.
Here... take the 100 bucks and start the water.
Uncle, why are you doing this?
He'll get into a bad habit...
Forget it, Madhav Kaka...
join the queue.
Madhav, fight about this with the secretary na!
He works in a bank, that's why he's throwing his weight around.
Stop all this argument!
What about the water?
Ask him not to mess around with these tanker guys.
There's a fight for water everyday.
Now he'll start the fight with everyone.
I'll be late for sure.
- I'm tired of living in Dombivli.
We should leave here and go somewhere else...
Is it always this crowded in Mumbai?
- Crowd is the other name for Mumbai... if it weren't so, the people of Mumbai would be lost.
There are so many problems in this Mumbai... but not one person is ready to leave it.
Sure, but at least we get our daily bread and butter.
We might get a small morsel, but it's with dignity.
In my village, there are only old people and women left... and they're also moving here one by one.
And the children?
- Even the kids will follow soon.
But then, there will be too much of population!
Huh?
- There is a lot of unemployment.
What Apte...?
I've taken half a day off.
So take care of the counter.
What is it...?
What is all this tension?
- Couldn't find it.
What's happening?
- Oh nothing at all... manager's gone on leave...
- Manager...?
I just met him.
Oh, not ours... the one in my house.
Oh, ok... your wife.
Why, where has she gone?
She's become an aunt, you see.
So she's gone for her sister's delivery.
There's someone else coming to take care temporarily today in the afternoon.
Oh, come on Deepak!
What would you know about the joys of having a current account?
You're one of those who love relishing the interest generated... from a fixed deposit...
little by little.
Anyway, I've said that my mother isn't well.
So keep this in mind.
You're the only one who knows that my mother passed years ago...
If Karkhanis goes into details... just tell him to bugger off.
Otherwise you will expose me...
I've got it.
Good morning sir...
- Yes?
Have you sent the file?
- What file... and to whom?
For my loan... to the manager sahib...
- Uhhhh...
No...
I mean I haven't got all your documents.
Submit those...
I've already had a talk about that... with manager sahib.
WHAT?
- I told him I would submit it...
So you've got them?
- No no...
Sir said that some adjustments will be made... and I'm an old customer of the bank.
I have huge credit for a loan...
That could be true...
but for the procedure the documents are mandatory.
Anyone who takes a loan has to do it... -
Of course I'll do that.
At least do the disbursement first.
I have an account here anyways...
No, but how will I be able to process the documents further on... so please?
Apte sahib... how many years have you known me?
And after the work is done, there is no one left unsatisfied... even the peon is suitably rewarded.
Look here Mr. Shah... after you get the loan, whatever you do is not my concern... you might have a deposit amounting to crores... but when you take a loan, you owe the bank... and every indebted person is the same.
It might be for 5,000 or 5 million.
Another thing.
I'm not the kind of officer... who will be satisfied with a bribe.
I'm happy with the salary I get.
Keep your money to yourself.
You're getting agitated for no reason sir... did I say anything to you?
Madhav, the Shah brothers have been our customers for years...
Will you mind your own business?
Mr. Shah, come back with the documents.
The loan will not be processed otherwise.
Please!
Apte sahib... take it easy...
What happened Apte?
- He's come to buy me!
God, he's such a liar...
I told him I'll give the documents later.
I'll even make the peons happy... there will be no one left unsatisfied...
WHO SAID THAT?
- Apte please...
calm down... please...
This is unbelievable!
Sir, I'm gonna withdraw all my deposits now!
Jitesh bhai, come into my cabin...
- Why...?
He tells me I'm indebted to the bank... he made me a part of the 5,000 line.
Is that the respect you show me?
- Please... come into my cabin.
Tell me who is the manager.
Please, Jitesh bhai, please...
- Why are you worried?
I'm there.
What Apte... what happened?
- Nothing.
No pictures today?
Are you not well?
Taken any medication?
Medicine... medicine... pill...?
No!
Want some tea?
Do you want some tea?
Here's what you'll do.
Here...
keep this money...
For medicine... keep it.
Buy medicines and take some rest... but only buy medicine ok?
Take some rest.
I say... what is it?
Nothing.
There is an interview tomorrow, I hope you remember.
Have to go.
Tell me your full name, child...?
- Prachi Madhav Apte.
Tell me your full address?
Madhuban Apartments
- Madhuban Apartments...
Ill floor, Vishnu Nagar, Dombivli East.
- West...
Telephone number?
- Telephone number... 33...
- 33003... 74 - 74
Very good, zero zero.
You speak such excellent Marathi.
One doesn't get to hear such Marathi these days... and she told the address also very correctly.
Well, what do you do Mr.s. Apte?
I stay at home... housewife.
Oh!
That's great... there has to be someone at home... and if it's the mother, so much the better.
I am telling you from my own experience.
Otherwise, it's too much of a confusion... home... work
In fact, these days, if the mom is at home, I encourage it.
As far as possible we only admit those children who have somebody at home.
Well, all the formalities of Prachi's admission are now completed.
Just one small thing.
It's like this... we have three seats and all the three are donation seats.
Hard luck, this admission is also gone.
Now put her in the Municipal school.
Alka, 35,000 is a bit too much.
- I was ready to mortgage my jewellery.
And then?
Were you planning to hover about like the Princess of Lanka?
Sure, I would have done that... from the hall to the kitchen and from there to the bathroom.
I would've climbed two floors just to fetch water.
I don't agree with these things, and even if I do...
I can't take on a loan of 35,000 rupees
- Never mind... even if you can manage that much in six lifetimes it's fine.
It's just that your child of this life is star-crossed.
Why are you creating this scene on the road?
Don't you remember what did she say?
Mr. Apte, why should a bank officer like you... think so much about a paltry sum of 35,000 bucks?
If you lose this admission just for 35,000 bucks... people will laugh at you.
I'm sorry Mr. S Apte, I tried everything I could from my side.
Anyway... may a brilliant child like Prachi find a fitting school.
What else can I say?
Stand upright.
You stop blabbering now, ok?
That Principal seemed to be trying to fleece us... understood?
If you have the money, there's a vacancy or else it's a no.
What does it mean?
It took me a while to figure out who I was talking to... was I talking to a principal, or a real estate agent?
You are the only one in this world who knows how to speak.
Right!
This talk of yours its going to push your children into a luckless life.
Damn it!
Neither a good place to live nor a good school to study.
What's not decent, tell me.
We have booked a place!
What good is that?
Everybody else has gone there to stay... and we are rotting here
- The builder's asking for money... for every little thing.
What can I do?
- But the others have paid, haven't they?
That doesn't mean I should. - Don't... we will stay here only.
Anyway we are losing the rent On top of it... the installments for that place are also getting deducted from your salary.
Had I taken up a job...
- If you have a problem, then...
I know, "separate... stay away" Isn't it?
You know I am suffering, but you won't help.
Just separate, right?
If you are so hell-bent on your principles... why don't you go out and make things happen?
Just tom-tomming about your principles won't achieve anything.
It's easy to yell that there has been a theft... but the real courage lies in catching the thief.
Stand upright...
raise your hand.
Finally, George Bush triumphed.
- Ya, sure... he knocked Kerry down.
Bush pumped in a lot of money.
But Musharraf escaped because of that.
Why's the train held up?
- Signal.
Mega block?
- Nonsense, not today?
Yes, he was run over by the train.
- Was it a man?
Who knows.
And what's the use now?
Got to burn him anyway.
There he hit a century and here he was bowled over to heaven.
Look, they have pulled him out.
This guy had to choose this very train to die.
15 minutes down the drain easily.
Don't take a peek, you would reel.
Madhav, is the admission done?
Did you tell the boss, I am taking half the day off?
Yes, boss.
I told him.
Just a minute... have some sweets.
- What's the occasion?
Remember that Jitesh?
His loan got sanctioned.
Have it, have it... sweets.
Apte, have some sweets.
We'll have the admission party later.
Jitesh Bhai has generously distributed sweets to everybody.
Yes and on top of it, he is going to give Diwali gifts.
I say, when it comes to treating people there's none like a Sindhi or a Gujarati.
Really!
- What's wrong?
Everything has been done satisfactorily.
Oh, Apte sahib!
Did you offer some sweets to him?
Sir, how was the loan sanctioned?
- What do you mean how?
As per my knowledge, his documents are insufficient.
Yes, but I got it done under my jurisdiction.
But sir, even powers vested with you come under the Reserve Bank Of India rules.
Ah... it's like this Apte Sahib...
- I am not talking to you!
His file isn'tjust lacking in documents I also doubt their authenticity.
Also, God forbid, if something happens... you will be the one to blame and the bank would take a beating.
Honest account holders would lose their money... people will lose theirjobs, sir!
Apte, why are you so agitated as though Skylab has fallen?
I've learnt more from the book of life than you.
You see, to secure things within the framework... one needs to bend the rules a bit... and this proves beneficial to the bank.
Okay.
I'll put this case up to the higher authorities.
You explain the gains to them.
- Apte, you're crossing the limits.
Before you do anything, please remember that I can ruin your life.
Get going...
Shh!
Why are you yelling?
Let him do what he wants to do, why are you getting hassled?
Go and lodge the complaint declare a strike... stage demonstrations...
You shut your mouth, understand?
You shut your mouth!
Apte... what's happened?
Why are you screwed up?
Me?
These guys will pay for their sins.
Get lost!
Let me see how do you manage to get this month's salary.
Don't mind, Sir!
God has given an additional quality to Marathi guys...
their egotism.
Listen, why are you behaving like a newcomer?
Slight fudging in the documents is an established practice.
What's new in that?
Listen, I am your friend.
That's why I am telling you... why do I care otherwise?
Hi, Seth!
So Deepak Bhai, how is life?
- First Class.
Cold drink?
- Yes.
I sincerely feel this world should change, but what to do?
Where does one begin and what are we left with?
Just get into whichever battle one can manage with the slogan...
"Har Har Mahadev" and brandish the sword just as you please...
If you are lucky, you will kill.
If you are not, you will die.
Well, if we have to die anyway, why talk of martyrdom?
Listen, I'll tell you a simple thing.
Look at my wife... she's just bloating like a debt account now.
To convert it to a regular account can you imagine the headache it would entail?
But I manage to do it.
Like we take a brand new passbook when the leaves in the earlier one run out...
I have organized a new slip outside home.
In the ultimate analysis, every man just lives for himself let the world go to blazes.
Uncle, how much is the bill?
- 14 rupees.
What Uncle?
2 bucks more?
- Exactly!
Listen my dear, it costs two bucks to chill the bottle.
What?
But they charge only twelve rupees in the hotel.
Go to the hotel.
You had your cool drink and cooled off your head also.
Now don't blow my head; get going.
- Ok.
OK.
- Let's go, he won't listen.
Come on, let's go.
What's our bill, seth?
- 14 rupees.
Give him 12, ok?
- It's 14 rupees sir... it costs two bucks to chill the bottle.
- Just a minute... how much did he pay?
14 rupees and I have returned him 6 bucks already.
No, No... you charge only 12 rupees and return the rest of it.
No sir... it costs 2 rupees more. -
What do you charge 2 rupees more for?
It's for the fridge, one has to chill the bottle in it... and there's the electricity bill on top of it... and electricity does not come free of cost.
Even our money does not come free of cost.
We give our sweat and blood, expend intelligence we break our back, you know that?
We have stiff backs.
Give only the printed price on the bottle don't give a penny more.
Hey sir, you keep quiet.
This transaction is between me and Deepak Bhai... and it's over.
Am I right...?
Don't leave a single penny, take it from him.
Listen, you relax, please...
- How can you...
I am in business for years but have never seen a fuss like this.
Fuss?
You keep extorting 2 bucks shamelessly from your customers.
Just because people like Deepak put up with it you have become insolent.
If you are so keen on business, why don't you return 2 bucks?
Sir... go to the Lower Court or the Supreme Court, I won't budge.
You have to give me two bucks extra.
Is that clear?
What nonsense!
Two bucks for what?
- Relax... come, let's go
How can you leave it like that?
How can you listen to people like this...?
This is absurd!
Forget it... why argue with him for two bucks
Deepak Bhai, you are breeding leaders or what?
Looks like the Boss has inundated him with work in the Bank... or may be he's fought with his wife.
- Shut up!
What are you staring at?
Get lost!
What are you doing...?
Call the police!
Look what he's doing!
Good Lord!
I'm screwed!
What...?
- Shell out two bucks
What...?
- Give back two rupees, now!
Wait till I give it to you!
Here you are.
Inspector, I just asked him for two rupees and he lost his head.
This boy was standing here with his cricket gear... he just picked up the bat smashed the entire shop.
Anything else?
- He dipped into the cash box too.
I made a hue and cry, so he spared it.
He smashed the whole shop and you kept quiet.
Did you know him?
He came in with my regular customer Deepak.
Where is this Deepak?
Sir, please don't go by the shopkeeper's account.
This Madhav is no hooligan... he's a thorough gentleman and an educated person.
Sir he is married, has two children.
Does he have any illness?
Any history?
No, nothing, but I don't know what was wrong with him today.
I mean, the way he behaved just for two bucks...
I mean that was it, he was really out of control.
Even I went numb for fifteen minutes.
You mean he did all this just for 2 bucks. -
There's nothing else that happened...
You see, it was I who paid up and I was the one who took the money.
And I have nothing to complain... but he thought that the shopkeeper was looting me and then he went berserk.
Does he have any problem at home?
- No, there is no way to ascertain it.
All right... did he meet you before he left... did he say something?
You see, once he went on a smashing spree nobody knew him.
And I say sir...
- Just a minute...
Gaikwad, just take down Apte's address and get on with your nextjob.
Well, does he have any weapon?
Whose bike is this...?
You've gone mad or what?
Does Madhav Sridhar Apte live here?
- Yes... yes...
Take this and put your signature here... and write your complete name under the signature.
If Madhav Sridhar Apte comes home, or if you establish any contact with him... send him to the Dombivli Police Station immediately... got it?
Hurry!
Two double spicy scrambled eggs two double omelettes, four buns...
Listen boy, do not act smart.
Are you here to laze about?
Come on, get some water here...
Make a half fry... sunny side up and down... and three single scrambled eggs... spicy with bun, pack it up...
Chotu, get two beers from there... hurry up.
Hurry up... clean up the mess.
Clean up the mess.
Attend to the customer.
Hey, pack up now... you baldie, shut down time.
- Greeting sir.
How many times must I tell you?
No, sir, just a couple of minutes more... there are only a few more...
we'll pack up.
Sir, what will you have?
- Get four spicy scrambled eggs.
Quick!
Brother, get me four scrambled eggs.
Get something cold for Sir...
come on, hurry up!
Wind up quickly and leave.
You guys are doing this every day.
Hurry...
Get some water.
- Cold water.
Quick
What are you staring for?
Are you drunk?
Can't you see the customer?
This is a hospital, my dear!
A regular hospital.
How can you park a cart here?
You're raising such a din... this place is reeking ...can't you understand?
There are patients out there.
Who are you?
Ward officer or a police commissioner...?
What difference does it make?
You are the police, right...?
You got to stop this... this is unlawful... what's going on?
Mister conscience-keeper!
Come on, don't try to teach us duty...
Why are you shouting, man?
Do you want to eat?
Okay...
Serve this guy too!
For heaven's sake don't shout...
No!
I don't want to eat...
put it down their throats!
Nothing quenches their ravenous appetites.
Their greed knows no limit!
Come...
It's people like you who encourage criminals.
Instead of standing for the rights of common men... you're siding with the unlawful businessmen.
Your uniforms can scarcely hide your ugly skin...
Hey, listen up!
If you abuse the uniform,
I'll strip you and whack you...
Yeah, sure... go ahead and whack me.
Let the world know about it.
Do you understand what a cop stands for...?
You guys hang the state laws along with your uniforms for five-bucks worth... of scrambled eggs... aren't you ashamed of yourself?
If you are so desperate, why don't you take up a job with the egg-vendor?
Shut up!
Why must we suffer for the taunts of crackpots?
Kadam, go on, listen to his night-long hymns now...
Shinde, if I lose it, I'll beat the shit out of this guy all night long.
Where did you get this slime-ball?
Hey, how dare you abuse the hawaldar?
You're an educated man, right?
Then, why were you abusing an asshole.
That was quite a sermon on the systematic.
Listen, just take a drag... the whole system will seem pretty to you.
He looks like a married guy.
Listen, why mess with these kinds?
Just hand the kickback and get going.
Hey hero!
Don't get into the lawyer and stuff... just slide something backhand and slink off.
Am I right, darling?
No Anna... no, he's not come as yet.
I'll check today.
I'll wait until tonight... and if needed, go to the police station tomorrow.
Yes... no... you don't worry... you don't make haste, there's the neighbour Gore uncle to lean on... he'll come along...
Okay.
Shall I hang up now...?
Okay.
Hey!
Hey!
You guys are upholders of law, isn't it?
Then why are you dozing away in the police station?
Get up.
I messed up and got this guy here!
Wonder from where this specimen got to the earth...
Shinde, switch off that light!
I'll let you know.
Good Morning, Sir.
- I'll call later.
Sahib, what are we supposed to do with this guy?
Note down his name and address and let him go.
- Okay.
Kadam...
- Yes?
Don't hand him that bat.
- Why?
He's a crackpot.
Come out...
Sunny Deol of Ghayal fame... come on.
I am talking to you, not the tanker!
Are you listening to me?
You and your overseer talk it out.
Why should we bear the brunt?
Look, I can't release water like that, I got to heed orders from top!
What orders?
What's this nuisance on a daily basis?
Okay, just part with fifty or hundred rupees...
I'll make sure higher-ups are spared.
- Hundred rupees?
I say, why should we shell out hundred daily?
Listen, just hand it... didn't I give it last time?
You?
Have you ever parted with even 50?
There!
Ask him.
- Look, you want the water, right?
Look here, just give me hundred bucks,
I'll let off the water right away
But why should I give a hundred?
I say who are we to give 100 rupees?
Listen, I will complain about you to the higher-ups...
Go to whoever you want to.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Don't you dare to touch my tanker.
Kupekar Sahib's.
Who Kupekar?
- The local councillor Kupekar.
Leave him.
Leave him.
Come down, hurry!
My sleep is screwed.
This man was blurting like a broken pipe.
Who was it...?
What's his name?
Madhav Sridhar Apte, Resident of Dombivli.
What else...?
Wireless...?
Control room...?
Phone...?
There's report from the control room about vandalizing of a shop... with a cricket bat.
It's registered at the Nariman Point office.
With a cricket bat?
When?
It happened yesterday
- So...?
I think this the same guy.
- How can you say that?
Even he had a bat.
What?
I hope you are in the bounds of sanity?
You let him go after you got the information from the control room...?
You could have at least gotten a hint from the bat he held in his hand?
Actually, I got the message after we let him off.
What?
- I mean the message had already come in.
But we couldn't quite get it in the midst of his jabber.
Precisely!
That's exactly why people blame the police.
Anyway, you held him for the night.
Hope you filed in a report?
Yes, I have kept it on your table.
- Thank God!
Yeshwant Kupekar Councillor
Your work will be done.
Okay, I got it.
But don't forget me you don't worry at all...
I want to meet the Councillor.
And all that's going to amount to...
- I want to meet the Councillor.
He is not here.
- Call him from wherever he may be.
There's an inauguration function today... he's gone there.
Where?
- You know the newly constructed swimming pool next to the school?
Well, he's gone there.
Yes, go on...
Yes, keep coming sometimes.
What else?
When should we meet?
Swimming pool?
Patil, you are on double duty now.
I want all the information about that guy immediately.
Dombivli means Thane district... what does it come under?
I'll look up...
- Get cracking.
Make calls and send wireless messages from Thane onwards.
Hurry up.
Yes sir...
- Another thing... who was manning the patrolling van last night?
Where?
- Near the food cart.
Who all were there?
Kadam, Shinde, Sonawane, and Jadhav.
What?
Was the whole police station out there?
This Apte is going to prove a tough match for all of you...
Sir, he didn't look like a criminal... seemed as if he had fought with his wife and come.
So far in your long service have you ever come across... the name Apte registered in the criminal's list?
You see, when these white-collar people commit a crime... the whole world talks about it.
Mind you, Patil it's not a simple case.
Keep in your mind.
Friends...
Politicians get elected but but after that they do not do anything.
They promise you a lot of things and... they never show their faces again, let alone doing your work.
But I am not one of them.
I have done what I had promised you.
And that's why I am proudly standing here...
Myself, Yeshwant Kupekar.
So Ladies and Gentlemen, we have all gathered here... for the inauguration of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation Swimming Pool.
We have overcome several obstacles to get to this point.
This corporation swimming pool opens up a golden opportunity... for the whole society.
I mean our precious little children will come here to swim... to learn to swim.
Our brothers and sisters will be delighted to swim here.
And this comes at a subsidized rate.
But I want to tell you something.
Come here to swim, not to have a bath.
Jokes aside, I had dreamt of constructing a swimming pool like this.
Fortunately, it's ready during my tenure and to top it... it's being inaugurated by me.
My friend was saying...
"Appa, take the swimming costume for the inauguration"
But I am afraid, I have another commitment.
Some other time.
Jai Hind.
Jai Maharashtra!
Out there, people are queuing-for water... they are putting up with the bullying of the tankerwalas and here you are, adding insult to our injury by constructing a swimming pool.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself...?
Have you no shame?
What right do you have to do this with our money?
And you have the audacity to name it after your father...
And gutters are swelling...
This place is infested with mosquitoes and you are misusing funds over this...
Aren't you ashamed?
Aren't you ashamed?
Shoot it!
Roll the camera, Quick.
Please welcome Priyanka Chopra, today's guest for the show.
Pakistan claims that this pipeline...
Are you in life...
- The commodity market...
Why don't you stop surfing?
Remember the politician of Mulund who was murdered?
Inspector Chauhan had solved the case...
Today is its crime report.
Sir, papers.
Make a file and send it to the head office.
- Ok sir.
The Municipal Councillor Yeshwant Kupekar was attacked by a mad man.
One minute, Shinde.
Don't change the channel.
One minute...
Mr...
Kupekar had come there to inaugurate the municipal swimming pool...
The assailant escaped in the ensuing chaos... but our cameraman, who was covering the inauguration... tried to capture the face of the assailant.
You misuse our money?
Aren't you ashamed...?
I don't know who that mad man was...
I have asked my officials to be on the alert.
The entire responsibility is now on the police... let's see what they do.
The reason behind the attack still hasn't been ascertained... but the possibility of political rivalry is being entertained...
Sir it's the same guy...
now carrying a knife.
Now regret what you have done!
You left him without questioning at night... and now he's roaming the streets with a knife... what should we do tell me...?
Should I tear the case paper you filed last night... or issue you a memo...?
He's roaming the streets free after stabbing a councillor...
God only knows how many more he will attack.
Sir...
Hello sir... sir... wanna get laid?
What you looking at?
Will you take me to the hotel sir?
- No.
So then what?
The garden?
- No.
Nowhere.
Then what?
Just the top bit?
- I told you nothing doing.
How old are you?
Are you a cop?
What language do you speak?
Hindi...
Marathi... a little bit of Gujarati.
Do you understand Marathi?
- I'm a Maharashtrian... go on.
I asked you how old are you.
It's been ten years since I dropped out of school.
And when did you drop out of school?
- In the 5th standard.
That means, 20 years.
And when did you begin to do all this?
It's been 4 years.
That means, 16 years old...
who all do you have at home?
What does that have to do with you?
It's a waste of time... you wanna get laid... get laid... otherwise buzz off.
Bloody shit!
I don't need this crap during my peak business hours.
Why didn't you pursue studies afterwards?
Get lost, mother f... - !
I'll break your teeth if you get abusive.
Aye... think you own me or what?
I pay four people to stand here.
One whistle and ten people will come running.
You looked like a gentleman, so I asked.
Go... go home... be with your kids.
And if you're angry, take it out on your wife...
Understand?
Wanna eat paan?
Listen, people come here to relax... don't make me loose my customers.
Go away.
Don't give me that shit...
get lost.
You don't want anything... just wasting my time for free.
I had told you that as soon as you make any contact with him... you must quickly inform us... and you...
- It completely slipped my mind.
Besides I haven't seen him...
I don't know what I'm saying.
Ok... has he ever had bouts of madness before.
Oh no, he isn't mad at all.
Don't lock him up saying he's mad.
In that case, what is the reason for such violence...?
Does he have any medical history... did you know him before marriage?
No... not one word is true.
I don't know why he suddenly started behaving like this.
Any addictions?
- No.
Does he think a lot?
Read a lot?
Yes... yes...
Any arguments thereof?
Here?
In the office?
Sir, many times...
I mean everybody used to council him... that there's no point in being such a goody-two-shoes.
Did you two have any arguments...?
I mean, do they happen?
Once in a while.
- About?
Just the other day, they were asking for donations... for our daughter's school admission... and he opposed...
Is he interested in social work etc...
No, not exactly.
Of course there was a row about collecting funds... for the Ganpati Puja... and a couple of complaints about the loudspeaker...
Did everyone know he was like this?
Yes... in fact, people used to taunt him.
Did he meet you that day?
I mean did you see him...
did he seem all right?
Scary...
like he'd lost his mind... something like that...
I couldn't recognize him.
And despite all my concern, I was scared.
That's why I couldn't go towards him... but now I feel, I should have gone... caught him and brought him back and should have tied him up.
What's going to happen to him?
Somebody was saying that the police would shoot him.
Is that true?
No... nothing of the sort will happen.
At least not right now.
Though his crime is grave... but a punishment also has its own procedure.
That's why I'm saying, let's make use of this period.
Mr.s. Apte please co-operate with us.
This is my card and telephone number.
If you make any contact whatsoever...
call me... any time... ok?
Thank you.
What do you want?
Want some stuff?
Hash...
Weed...
Opium...
what do you want?
C'mon.
Hurry up and make a packet.
What do you wanna do with them?
Look at them... they're sleeping here.
Hey pundit, I've told you a hundred times... why do you give stuff to people who can't handle it.
Are you mad...?
Sir... wait here, I'll be back.
Go do your work... come on, make those packets.
Dada... he needs stuff...
- Who?
- That gentleman.
Who is he?
Salaam Saahib...
want some stuff?
See, this stuff is Rs.100 for 10 gms and the Manali stuff is Rs. 400 for 10 gms... which one do you want?
If we do a proper combing operation, we'll catch him quickly.
Everyone knows that Bhoir.
But is he just another monkey, or is he the mighty Hanuman...?
Is he trying to burn Is he creating a problem for Ravana?
It will be decided only after an enquiry takes place... whether to catch him, kill him, or let him go.
What do you think?
- Me?
- Yes.
I think we should take him home... give him our uniform and send him on the beat everyday.
Does that sound good?
Speak up, Bhoir.
What crime has Madhav Apte committed?
Don't tell me the clause of the penal code... what were the circumstances in which the crime was committed?
Don't we take all this into consideration?
Well then... try to remember what Madhav Apte did... vandalized a shop... why?
Just because the shopkeeper asked for two bucks more.
Who's the culprit?
He picked up a fight with the roadside snack cart vendor.
What for?
The police were providing him illegal protection.
Again who's the culprit?
He smashed the bike... was parked in a no parking zone.
Who's the culprit?
Stabbed the councillor... why... shall I tell you?
Who...?
Who's the culprit...?
What Bhoir, the police should also think... how can someone who toes the line be so violent?
Problems are not solved with a stick or a bullet.
The thing doesn't end with it... itjust comes to a halt.
Yeah!
Where?
The fire started from Lala's shack.
- Lala...?
The same one sir...
the narcotics guy.
But I thought he had retired.
- No sir... he's been active for the past 8 months.
Did our people know this?
- Yes sir.
And even then...?
Call Lala.
Who was it?
- I don't know Inspector...
I thought he had come to buy the stuff.
Then...?
- Then what?
He took out a knife and I took out my revolver...
Drop that knife!
Catch him!
Catch him!
Hold him tight.
Snatch the dagger from him.
Hold him tight.
Run!
Run!
Sir, he's none other...
He's that guy.
Madhav Apte?
- Yes sir... now he is brandishing a revolver.
Pictures...
Mud...
Mud... smear the cowdung on the mud.
And make a rangoli on that... this is how the picture was made.
But there everything started, with tar instead of cow dung.
Greed... insatiable appetite And want for more and more... it went beyond the bounds... and after that the jobs and businesses sprang up.
The job and the salary soon became insufficient... profits in business were also inadequate.
Then it all began... fights for increase in salary, strikes,
deceit for more profits...
bribes and theft... it spread like a disease... and the bloody lotus got sucked into the marsh.
I used to write so well, used to paint beautiful pictures... but then I needed money.
The bank provided stability.
I studied till my B. Com, I read extensively and what after that...?
Fill in the ledgers, take care of the accounts...
I was drained of all my passion.
There was not a drop of moisture left in me... not even to show.
Lead your life along one straight line write in one particular way get a degree in one go, get confirmed in yourjob in one year... get married for one desire... and add a parallel line and give birth to children... peruse several things one by one, and then die in one shot.
Which means to begin yourjourney from one and proceed on the onerous task... of life by oneself through this life wrenching journey... and then die alone.
This bloody journey... can't this journey be straight?
Can't it be like the heart...?
True, it has been decided by everyone that we must follow the rules... diligently adhere to them.
Then why the hurry to break them?
Should we eat together or hog everyone else's share?
Decide, you don't want discipline...
go ahead... become lawless.
If you want to be shameless... be shameless together...
why alone...?
Why bear the burden alone?
Live and let live, if you don't want to abide by this... let's all come together and resolve... die and kill.
Let's finish this off once and for all... and tell the Creator, "We didn't like your little game..."
"we didn't like your game at all."
I, the undersigned Madhav Apte, makes this declaration... that due to my own philosophical differences...
I am not eligible to live on this planet.
So please take away my service and
I do not expect any payment from you.
In fact I would like to pay all the dues on my account.
So please my Lord, God...
I'm enclosing my body with my soul, intact... with this declaration.
So please accept this and... relieve me at the earliest...
please... thanking you, yours faithfully.
What are you doing?
I'll heat the food.
- No.
Give me some milk... cold.
Did you eat outside?
- No.
Then...?
It's almost three... what will I be able to eat and digest.
I'll give you some milk.
What's up?
Vaishu, how much money does a man need to live?
Why get into all this now...?
Did you make a big raid or something?
How many crores were there?
Or did you bump of someone who turned a sharpshooter for just 500 rupees?
Take my advise.
Go and see Dr. Vatve.
Dr. Vatve?
- Yes... psychiatrist.
You've started thinking too much nowadays.
Don't laugh.
There was an article in the newspaper... saying the Mumbai police is under great stress.
Why doesn't the government increase the number of policemen?
Don't you need rest...?
There are otherjobs for that.
The police are under stress... but the stress is of the mind rather than that of work or criminals.
Just tell me, do you think we could have led our life happily... with what I earn?
I don't think so.
Then how can I take any rest?
This is the stress the police suffer.
To do the exact opposite of the job that we get money for... and run a home in that.
My condition is the exact opposite of Valya Koli.
His family had forsaken him because he was a plunderer... and here my family is showing me the utmost respect for what I'm doing.
Come on...
Ok.
Mohsin, should we go for a take?
Is the frame alright?
- Look at him...
Because of these new equipments, the public will find it easier.
Even though there is a while before this work reaches an end... but the heart surgeon here, Dr. Ajai Rai, says... that by next month there will be new facilities available.
Hello... which way to the first floor?
Excuse me...
No.
Your reports have not yet come.
Sister... ah... admit...
Take him to the counter over there.
Make the case papers.
But he...
- Never mind!
Take him there and make the case papers.
No problem.
Ok.
Ok.
Bye!
Your receipt.
Bhanudas Kale, you just had a check up, now...
Were you asked for any reports?
- No.
Pay Rs. 150.
Your name?
- My name is Keshav Joshi.
Are you're the patient?
- No.
Malati...
Malati Keshav Joshi.
My wife.
There is no pain now, right!
- No... but Dr. Ghaisas said that she should be admitted.
He thought Dr. Ajay Rai should take a look.
Admit...?
- Yeah.
Dr. Ghaisas said you have some beds at discounted rates.
Yes, but they are all full.
Here's what you can do.
Ajay Sir is at Hinduja's on Wednesdays and at the KEM on Fridays.
You better try there.
Son, I have come all the way from Thane.
I took the 6'Oclock local train.
To get here.
I had to waste an hour and half outside... even inside, I have been around for half an hour to 45 minutes.
Yes!
What you say is right we have nothing to gain by delaying you.
Besides, Sir will yell at us unnecessarily.
Can I meet him directly?
Listen, he hasn't yet come in, and even if he comes... he is going to tell you the same thing.
Hey Janardhan, come here
- What's it...?
Look here, he has come here with a letter.
He's saying that the patient should be admitted into the ward... what should we do?
- Are you the patient...?
Oh, no!
His wife is the patient.
- No...
She is...
He told you that there is no vacancy?
Ah... move the patient away from here.
What did you tell him?
I told him go to Hinduja or KEM. -
Grandfather, why don't you go to KEM?
See if you go to Hinduja, it's going to cost you a lot of money.
If you go to KEM instead, it will be quite cheap.
What...?
Listen, Dr. Ghaisas sent me here because it is cheap here.
This ward has twenty beds.
What's more, when the government gives the space, they put this condition.
If I have to go somewhere, why not here...?
Grandfather, reservation does not work like that.
Government loses nothing in making rules.
How long does it take to fill up 20 beds?
Ah!
Don't waste time here.
It's better that...
Listen, return his letter.
You go to KEM, ok?
Sable, what happened to patient 8 ward 27?
Why are you talking like this...?
He is like your father.
Precisely!
But he does not understand And if everybody blocks... the queue like this, how are we supposed to do our work?
Hey!
Look here.
Well... who is the patient?
Who is the patient?
Excuse me, sir!
Something more about the equipment?
What more can I say!
Like I told you... this equipment that we getting is state-of the-art.
And he common man is going to benefit from this immensely.
Excuse me, Dr. Rai!
I have a question for you...
Which common man are you talking of?
Can you tell me, please!
Your staff cannot even talk decently.
Who are you?
I am a common patient who cannot afford your hospital fees...
Just a minute... how I am to be blamed?
If you can't afford this hospital's fee... why don't you move to the Civic Hospital?
Don't get overexcited.
Please keep this off the record.
- Definitely, Sir.
Anyway, what was I talking about?
You can't even speak properly to your patients... in whose name you hog all the grants...
What?
Have you no responsibility at all?
Look at the way your staff deals with the senior citizens!
Is this any care?
This is insolent business, nothing else!
Is this the way you fill the charity beds?
In what way are your responsible?
Could you tell me that, doctor?
Pawar, admit him... and don't even take any money from him.
Are you done?
Can I go now?
Did you call the police?
- Yes sir!
Don't pay too much attention...
it's a psychic case.
Come, grandmother!
Let me see who stops you from getting admitted here...
Don't touch me, you swine!
It's better that I die like this than be at the mercy of goon like you!
Grand mother!
Why are you...?
- Don't you dare speak with me!
I have seen all your dirty pranks... you pointed a pistol at the doctor.
We consider him to be God...
God...
If there is anyone who can feel your pulse after God it's a doctor... how dare you threaten him?
Why are you meddling with us unnecessarily?
Malati...
- Come on...
Stop wasting your time on him
Let's go to KEM.
The same doctor is going to...
It's ok with us...
let's go.
After threatening the life of the one who saves lives... let him take the medicine...
I don't want it.
Sir, there's a ground-breaking story... . here at Shreya Nursing Home.
Where is Shekhar Sir?
I've been trying to contact him ever since... please send an OB van here...
immediately.
There is a hostage situation in the hospital!
You're right to be angry...
but the approach was wrong.
Through force, through violence... the question might be answered quickly... but it only seems so.
On the contrary, .
This will definitely give rise to new questions.
My wife decided to join KEM and immediately answered the question... that is called a smart move.
And whoever has this wisdom is different from the animal.
And hence a human being.
And though I would like to thank you your behaviour at the end has held me back.
Think about this... do think.
Move back.
All of you move back.
Where is he.
Where...?
- Over there.
Bhoir, check that way too.
Be quiet.
Calm down.
Everybody calm down.
One minute.
Please calm down.
Please don't everyone talk at once... wait a minute... wait a minute... please.
The place you can see behind me is... the place where the latest hostage crisis... has taken place at the Shreya Nursing Home.
Everything took place suddenly... so much mayhem... and because of this the patients had a lot of problems...
Listen... he made us work under gun point...
Such a dangerous person he was... he immediately pulled out the gun.
All this is sheer forcefulness.
Police must take some action against this.
This is a hospital... there will be no hooliganism here.
Exactly... that is my point.
We doctors have lost our sense of security.
I mean, somebody just walks in and points a gun at your head?
He just forced us to do all this.
What is all this...?
We as a doctor community are threatened by anybody for no rhyme or reason!
We do so much for the patients and what do we get in return?
This?
What's going on in the city, Secretary?
As the Home Minister, I am answerable to the Chief Minister.
- I've spoken to the I.G., sir.
He and the Commissioner are both coming here.
I've fixed a meeting for this afternoon, sir.
A serious incident took place at a hospital in Mumbai today...
Madhav Apte...?
Sir, what do you think of Madhav Apte?
No comments... sorry.
Who Apte...?
That moron?
It's good... at least someone is doing something about this.
Hey Apte come here.
Whatever he's doing is correct.
Every common man should take such a stand.
Look at him...
- Look at him.
Is he an Aries or a Leo?
This is something that must be deeply contemplated...
"Girdle up your loins, fist clenched..."
"here cometh a Marathi lad, to fight valiantly"
What do you expect man?
The stress in the city is comparable to a war.
First was the industrial revolution, the bourgeois culture... the post-war blues, then globalisation...?
C'mon, we're doing to die, man!
"Heart adorned with a wreath of rebellion fire in the belly, humbling Time..."
Will his movement make them reduce the prices of cooking gas or kerosene?
"Paceth the rare soldier, Brooketh he no patience..."
"marcheth forth with his head held high"
I don't know... here we can't look after ourselves... who watches TV?
"Madhav Apte"
- Who Madhav?
You're going to show me on TV, no...?
Please...
I think...
I think he is cute.
Where I live in Kandivali, a man was fighting with his wife... and smashed an entire shop.
There were 10 lakhs worth of damages.
I don't know anything.
I've just started this business.
You know how it is.
There's so much increasing tension... that no one can keep their calm.
I don't think he's mad.
There must be some reason behind it.
What is happening to this city?
What all we have to put up with...?
You are making a mountain out of a molehill.
I promise you, we have everything under control.
Even if ten Madhav Aptes are born in this city...
I assure you, we can fight them.
We have enough manpower.
Saw him on TV...
looked mad.
He should be caught or he can harm others as well.
The police should be the first to catch him.
The public might mistake us for him and thrash us.
Today, in a prominent Mumbai hospital... a mad man threatened the hospital workers at gunpoint... and created mayhem at around 9 o' clock in the morning.
The hospital premises...
Hello...
- Alka...?
Where are you?
Are you alright...?
Are you in Dadar...?
Why don't you do something?
My aunt is there, .
Go to her.
If you come this side...
Thane... get off at Thane...
Manju lives there... go to Manju... or will you come back home?
Alka...
Listen, I'm ok... don't worry about me, I'm ok
I'll be a little late...
I'm not at work, but I'll come.
Don't worry...
Listen... but you...?
Look Alka...
listen to what I'm saying.
I'm not going back to office.
I'm going to resign... and the money I get, we'll put it in the bank.
And we'll plan everything based on its interest.
I've figured it out.
Don't worry.
When I get back, I'll explain everything.
We'll put the children in a corporation school... and I'll sit at home and give tuitions.
And I'll look after the kids' studies.
You wanted to start the tiffin business... you start that, the catering business is good.
And we'll slowly expand it.
We know people, they'll help us.
We have to paint the house, it's been so long.
I haven't had the time only.
Now when I get back, it's the first thing we'll do.
Has Prachi eaten...?
Or baba will feed?
Has she been waiting?
Feed her... just give her the phone...
No no...
I'll start crying.
What was I saying?
Now you have to...
like this...
I have a shooting pain in my head.
I was saying... when I get there, I'll explain it.
Don't worry.
Remember, you used to tell me to straighten things out and show you?
So I taught two people a lesson.
After I come... there's a station nearby.
I'll come...
I feel... an hour and a half...
- Come home...
Hello...
I'll find the station, don't worry... hello...
Alka?
Can you hear me?
They'll shoot you...
Today we're at Dombivli station... this is the same place where Madhav Apte catches his train everyday.
It's been two days since he's been home.
And all these people are waiting... for him to get off the train and come out of Dombivli station.
Even as a child, Madhav was self respecting.
He never believed in lying.
Like father like son.
He used to play cricket with us as a child... he was always the umpire... but even by mistake he never cheated and gave anyone out.
His father used to come to our RSS wing... so love for his nation must have run in his blood.
But Madhav was principled.
Even though the police have to say that Madhav Apte is a very dangerous man... but the people here have a completely different story to tell.
So now the question is...
who is Madhav Apte?
And why is doing this?
Anuradha Trivedi from Dombivli, for Zee News.
I...
I stay at home nowadays with my wife... the 7 o' clock news... at home only huh... at home only... nothing outside the house.
Everything outside has come to a halt just like you were saying... now...
I swear nothing...
Madhav...
I... these days,
I don't allow anyone to open an account without completing these formalities.
No favouritism.
Today there was a meeting with the CM the Home Minister and Chief Secretary.
Central Ministry has also asked for some explanation.
I have to send a report to the Governor sahib tomorrow... and in the middle of this, some people from our department... are asking for a transfer replacement.
I tell you, Anaspure.
This police job... the most critical job to do.
So what do you want to do now?
Spot him and shoot, or catch him and kill.
Sir...?
- Just kill him, Anaspure.
We'll see to the public litigation later.
But sir... after we kill Madhav Apte, he will become a martyr.
Create a record for him...
mental disorder... hyper anxiety... use some medical term.
Say that he's mad.
Tell the public that he can kill anyone.
Just like that Raman Raghav.
Apte means he's a Brahmin, right?
- I'm sure he's a lunatic.
No way... he's a class-one officer at the bank.
They're always like this.
Never say anything about this type of illness before marriage...
God only knows what his wife will do.
But he's not killed even one man till date.
I know, Anaspure.
Even though I want to, I can't praise him for this.
I'm a protector of the law.
The government pays me to wear this uniform.
Another thing, Anaspure... in this country it is more important to protect the ministers... than to protect its peace...
whether we like them or not.
Social awakening, my foot!
This is politics.
I tell you the opposition cannot stand this government... this is one of their people.
If you don't make Madhav Apte Raman Raghav today... tomorrow the public will make him God.
He'll be Robin Hood, he'll be a prophet.
Every house will have his photo and they will be decorated with garlands.
Move it, Bhoir... it's time for a man hunt.
At the end, everyone will try and save his own skin.
People also don't understand anything.
They've declared Apte a lunatic and forgotten about it... why should we fire bullets...?
Why should we shoot...?
Whose responsibility is law and order...?
He has left us barefaced, that's why all this anger.
When I got this job.
I used to think
I'll uphold the law and order... but as I got promoted, I realized that the ones who break this law and order... are the one's we are supposed to protect.
Our monthly salary is less for us and so we get a pocket money... we sell ourselves.
Whatever we don't do even with our salary... it's the same job he's doing while putting his life in danger.
So let's just kill him... the man who has been yelling himself hoarse to bring back law and order.
This is a fantastic ploy to kill that man by calling him mad... and putting him to his death in the name of law.
Yes, shoot at sight.
If there were mirrors in the police station... then, according, to the shoot at sight order... who would we shoot...?
Shoot at sight.
Bhoir... is the news confirmed?
Yes sir...
Notjust one, three people have called.
Sir...
Madhav Apte?
Yes...
I'm inspector Anaspure.
Tell me...
You'll have to come with me.
- Where?
To the police station.
- Whatever for?
I have something important to speak with you.
Listen, I have a bit of a problem right now... it's very important that I go home... isn't it ok if I come tomorrow?
No, you'll have to come now.
You see it's like this...
I haven't gone home in the last 2-3 days.
My wife and children are waiting for me. -
Sorry, but you'll have to come with us.
I told you I need to go home.
- Vandalizing a shop... ruckus on the street, setting slums on fire... creating mayhem in the hospital you've been charged with all of this.
I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
Under arrest!
Please...
let me go home please.
Alka is waiting for me back home.
My daughter must be missing me... please.
Well... if you like, I'll come to the police station... trust me, I'll come on my own... please...
Please let me go now.
Jadhav...
Bhoir... put him in the jeep. -
Please I'll come tomorrow definitely.
Hello...
I will come tomorrow...
- Shinde, inform the Control Room... that Madhav Apte's been caught.
- Listen to me... sir please... let me go home...
tomorrow I will... tomorrow... please let me go home... let me...
I'm telling you...
let me go home...
Madhav, lower that gun.
Let me go home, they're waiting for me. -
Listen to me Madhav, drop the gun...
They're waiting for me... please...
Madhav, please listen to me... drop the gun.
I'll help you, Madhav...
nothing will happen to you.
Madhav, please...
I have a shoot at sight order.
Madhav, drop the gun...
Please Madhav!
Don't be crazy, Madhav... listen to me, Madhav!
Please!
Jadhav, pick up the gun.
Sir...
Shit!
Officer...
I have spent all my life on the fourth seat... may I sit by the window?
Shinde, ask the motorman to take the train ahead.
Did you eliminate him?
I had to.
At least this time send you're name up there for the president's medal.
Why don't you take a break for a few days?
We'll go to my place Vaijapur.
We'll see.
Now why are you sitting here like this?
All the press people and the TV crews must be on their way.
Are you ready with your lines?
Yes.
What are you going to say...?
Madhav Apte chose the easy way out.
But the government... opted for an even easier path.
Are you going to say this...?
Yes, in my mind.
The questions to which you cannot find any answers... are crossed out.
It's the same with people.
One gets rid of them and goes ahead.
The ordinary man does back-breaking work everyday... and if, by chance, he happens to raise his head... it is ourjob to push him back down.
If he still resists, we push him to the ground.
And if the struggle continues, we just wrench his neck around.
There are tens of thousands of people walking with their head pushed down.
And in this mass of people, one forgets an individual face... mingled in the crowd.
And still the crowd keeps moving.
At it's own pace.
With every head still pushed down.
Little Lise
So...
- now were going to the water, okay.
Won't you wear more clothes, daddy?
No, it doesn't matter.
Come.
- What about mommy?
- She's sleeping.
- Daddy, watch out for Louise.
- Oh yes, I almost forgot.
Just get in, Louise.
Just close the door again.
Isn't the water now cold, daddy?
Yes, but...
- it's mommy's own decision, and she'll get mad if we prevent it.
Why is mommy in the back?
That's because mommy is very tired, and she needs to sleep some!
So there she lies.
But I really need to leave, little honey!
Cause... daddy and I, don't get along anymore.
But I love you!
And I will always be here for you, no matter what happens.
Do you want to leave, mommy?
Because...
- that... daddy and I...
- we don't get along anymore.
And it's hard to live together, when you don't feel well.
But as often we can, we'll see each other, right.
Mommy have found a new family she loves more than us, Lise.
How can you ever believe, I want to stay here with you?
You know what, I think of Lise and you don't, you want to pull her...
- Don't make me believe that idiot!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Lise...
Lise!
Lise, go up to your room!
Go up to your room, Lise!
Come Louise, we're going up.
Stupid mommy!
That's right Louise, they are the stupid ones.
... she don't!
And don't...
It's perfectly normal for a child to have invisible friends!
I had invisible friends myself, miss perfect?
Does this ideal mother drag her little kid into court and accuses me of bad fatherhood?
!
You're not a good example, are you!
You're a complete maniac!
- Yes, completely sick, crazy...
- And don't, don't...
- You're using Lise against me!
- I'm not fucking using anyone, -
- I try to prevent you, from taking her from me, okay!
- That's a fucking lie!
- Don't fucking hit me, okay!
- Don't hit me, don't take her!
- Let go, let me go!
You are not taking her from me!
Are you with!
- I do whatever...
- Just try again!
Just try again, you fucking cunt!
- I think you should take Lise to a shrink.
- Really.
Yes, I really think so.
And fix your own problems at the same time!
What kind of problems are you trying to solve, your just drinking.
Not so stiff anymore.
No, no, no.
Don't touch honey.
Mommy?
Mommy, wake up.
Mommy?
Don't cry.
Mommy can't hear you, cause she's sleeping so heavy, okay.
So...
If you tie this around the stone, then papa ties around the legs, okay.
- No, I don't want to.
- Listen, do what papa tells you and tie around the stone and be a good girl, okay.
Let me do it.
Now is mommy going down to the seahorses, okay.
So.
Lise...
Daddy loves you!
I'll always be there for you, okay.
No matter what happens...
Okay.
Do you know that?
Now it's time to say goodbye to little Louise.
We will attach a stone to Louise, okay.
And then she will join mommy in the water.
Lise...
Lise...
Lise...
Louise, can't you hold anything yet?
Wow, Louise, now you can yourself.
Your my best friend in the whole world.
Are we still best friends, Louise?
Louise...?
Translated by fuEgo
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs. Kringle.
These last 15 pounds.
I've just had no luck getting rid of them.
The first 75 didn't exactly fall off, either.
It's a proven fact that men and women lose fat at different rates.
Why do you always have to compare?
You were the one sneaking all the extra zone bars, mama.
That's all I'm saying.
Wesley and I used to both be a lot heavier, but we went on a liquid diet last spring, and together lost almost 200 pounds.
That's impressive.
Congratulations.
But now the holidays are here and
I've just gotta lose these last few inches before Christmas.
Can lipo help?
Usually we get requests like yours after new year's, when everyone makes their resolutions.
Oh, we made a resolution a year ago to be at 10% body fat by now.
It was a career choice.
Joy and I, we're the feature attraction over at the dolphin mall during the holidays.
We work as Santa and Mrs. Claus.
With a name like kringle, what are the odds?
Oh, it's not a coincidence, doctor.
Thank you.
We used to be the Mayfields, but we had our name legally changed back in '91.
I think that's when we started putting on the weight, right?
Well, we were very method back then.
Of course, with childhood obesity rates the way they are today, fat is not an image we want to promote anymore.
The holidays don't have to be about gluttony and overindulgence.
The true spirit of Christmas is about celebration and good cheer, and studies show that people are much cheerier if they're healthy.
Now, we try to teach the kids that.
Even our candy canes are sugar-free.
We do this for the children.
We never had any of our own and it ruined the holidays for us, so one year as a joke, we dressed up as the clauses and we got so much enjoyment out of seeing the kids' faces,
we never stopped.
We take it very seriously now.
Does that mean we'll be sending your bill to the North Pole?
Well, we can certainly explore the option of micro-lipo, although I have to say, having 2 kids of my own, the idea of a trim Santa seems nontraditional.
You still pad the suit, though, right?
I was planning on bringing my daughter by next week.
It's our sincere hope that by the time your kids have kids, doctor,
Santa will no longer be thought of as the fat man.
He'll be trim, tight, and a little bit sexy.
What about the elves?
I always felt like that was indentured servitude.
Are you gonna do something about that?
Do you think Mary had sex with God?
Well, um, my personal theory is that Mary got it on with Joseph before the wedding, and then when Jesus was born less than 9 months later, she told everyone it was a virgin birth.
That way, no one would know she had sex before she was married.
It would be pretty tough to get away with that today.
Matt, knock it off.
Although, come to think of it, you and I know someone a lot like the virgin Mary, only she got pregnant by her husband's best friend before the wedding.
She also told a big old whopper of a lie, and everyone believed it for a very long time.
Yes, but her baby was no son of God.
It was a joke, mom.
I'm sorry.
Jesus, you're white as a sheet.
Uh, I'm not feeling very...
Oh, ok.
Hey, whoa.
I got you.
I got you, I got you.
Here, come here.
For years, I've been recommending you get a flu shot, Julia.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have bothered you, but Dr. Edelman's out of town, and...
I've been feeling really run down.
Well, you've had a rough month.
And it wouldn't be Christmas if you weren't trying to do more than humanly possible.
At least when I was around, you had a little help with all of it.
This will sting a little.
I think you're mythologizing our holidays together, Sean.
What I remember most is nagging you endlessly.
I remember that, too.
Just hold this.
I miss all of it.
Uh, so, you guys doing the big turkey dinner thing?
No.
Not this year.
Matt's been invited to the Aldermans and Annie's going to Epcot with the Epsteins.
So I imagine you and Quentin will be skiing in Gstaad or snorkeling in St. Bart's, then.
I'm not seeing Quentin anymore.
And he's no longer working at the spa.
- He quit?
- I fired him.
Please, Sean, no paternalistic I told you so's.
I was just gonna say that
I'm sorry if that puts a damper on your Christmas.
No.
I have a ton of work to do, and this year, Christmas is just another day.
Yeah.
Well, aren't you gonna put the band-aid on me?
R ight.
Sorry.
What?
I was just thinking that... that we should have Linda do a blood panel, make sure you're not anemic.
Y eah.
Fine.
You're the doctor.
This is so wrong.
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think they could put religious stuff on school grounds.
Matt, are you looking at their faces?
They're black!
Jesus was not black.
They're a little dark-skinned, maybe, but it's not like they have afros.
Huh.
It figures they would be allowed to do this.
Well, if you're that upset, talk to the principal.
Right.
Principal Goldberg?
Matt, she's a jew.
She doesn't care about Christmas.
She's at home on the 25th eating chinese food or something.
I mean, if she really cared about this, this wouldn't have happened.
This whole thing is a fairy tale.
Come on.
I thought we were skipping last period.
The story of the birth of Jesus is sacred, Matt.
It's the foundation of all christianity.
Saying that Jesus was a mud baby is like pissing on the bible.
You're not supposed to take it literally.
The story's for kids.
Jesus is Santa Claus for adults.
Do you know who Santa was before he became the marketing tool he's today ?
St. Nicholas, the patron saint of charity.
But by 1930, when Coca-Cola got ahold of him, he suddenly became this big fat-ass in a red suit, flying around with a sleigh and reindeer, totally corrupting the holiday and mocking any religious meaning behind it.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
It's a perfect example of what happens when we don't protect our history.
When we don't protect our truth, it can be rewritten.
We have to do something.
The messiah?
Liz, I thought you were an atheist.
I kind of go on the wagon around the holidays.
You miss out on too much good music if you don't.
And it puts me in a very forgiving mood.
Well, in that case, I'm glad it's on.
All right.
Shall we suck the pringles out of the kringle?
Oh, sorry, maestro.
We started the performance without you.
Are you ok?
You look like somebody dumped a lump of coal in your stocking.
Julia's pregnant.
What?
She came in earlier for a flu shot,
I ran a blood panel as a precautionary measure, and the lab just called and said she was pregnant.
Did you tell her?
Liz, you can't say anything.
I think Julia's gonna be able to figure this out for herself.
How long ago did she and Quentin start seeing each other?
- Shit.
- Yeah.
No, shit, I hit something.
Look.
What does it feel like?
I don't know.
Like a tumor or a hernia, maybe?
That's no hernia.
What are her vitals?
Heart rate's increasing.
We're gonna have to open her up.
I'll go talk to Santa.
All right, we're gonna need a laparotomy tray.
Consent signed.
We're going in.
10 blade.
What the hell is that?
That's not growing out of her uterus, is it?
Oh, my god.
It looks like somebody else didn't realize they were pregnant, either.
Heads up.
- Nice catch.
- I gots the good hands, baby.
Oh, don't I know it.
We have to do it, I guess.
I know I'm supposed to call, but I... took a chance.
I thought you'd want these.
It's the handmad ornaments for when the kids were little.
Great.
One more box of decorations to hang.
Annie said you guys already trimmed the tree.
Yeah, well, you know how it is, Sean.
Everyone starts out with good intentions.
Than eventually I'm all by myself, eating all the cookies and guessing out loud to Jeopardy.
By the way, have you seen Matt's baby ornament?
I mean, maybe it's in here, but
I don't know what could have happened to it.
Do you think it's bad luck to lose your baby's first ornament?
Is that like losing your wedding ring?
Julia, the blood panel came back.
You're pregnant.
Pregnant with a...
what did you call it?
A lithopedion.
Litho meaning stone, pedion meaning child.
You had a... petrified fetus inside of you.
How does something like that happen?
At some point, you had an undiagnose pregnancy and the fetus died.
Through some fluke, it remained in your abdominal cavity and just calcified overtime.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
How long has it been in there?
I'd say at least 15 years, maybe even 20 due to the level of calcification.
The pathology lab will be much more precise.
I'm sorry.
This is kind of hard to believe.
I don't believe it.
The evidence is pretty irrefutable.
I'm not pretending that I'm the virgin Mary, but what I'm saying is that...
I just didn't expect this.
I have a colleague, a very good doctor who could take care...
I'm not ready for that conversation, Sean.
I'm just trying to be helpful, Julia.
I'm probably state it obviously here, but Quentin is not someone you want...
- Please Sean, don't say any more.
- Do you want this baby?
I always wanted a baby.
Both of us did.
We were told it wasn't a possibility.
Was it a boy or a girl?
After they run all the tests, we'll know more.
The organs weren't visible.
Can I see it before it's sended off?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I need to see it.
I need to be alone now, Sean.
You haven't said anything to Quentin, have you?
That's your job, Julia.
I'd never do that.
Are you gonna tell him?
Sorry.
Like I said earlier, I should have call first.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell Santa.
Is that for me?
You shouldn't have.
I'm here for my payout, Christian.
You haven't answered my calls.
I'll get it off in the morning.
I need it now.
I'm leaving for the holidays in the morning.
All by your lonesome?
Whatever happened to your burgeoning relationship?
What relationship?
I was under the impression that you and Julia...
Julia and I had a parting of the ways.
What was the problem, she didn't have a dick?
I'll tell you something, Christian.
She tried to blow me in her jacuzi and I had this epiphany.
If I'm finding this the sad chore, how could I possibly go further?
I had to finish off in the jet.
- So you and Julia never...
- No.
Not once.
I want my money now.
To be honest, I'm thrilled to be writing this check.
It means I'll never have to lay eyes on you again.
What a gift.
Happy holidays.
Can you tell that she's still black?
She looks albino.
You know, I was, uh...
I was thinking we should water some of this paint down so that they don't like so cartoonish.
No.
I think we're gonna have to do second coats on all these.
They're not white enough.
You're kidding, right?
No.
I mean, you can tell that she's black.
Look, when the light hits her, you can definitely tell.
I think people will get the point.
I don't want people to know that they were black underneath there before.
Why is that wrong?
Are you ok?
Do you love me?
- Is that what this is about?
- Do you love me ?
Honey, I just stole the baby Jesus because you asked me to.
Yes, I love you.
So if I told you a secret, you'd promise not to tell anyone, right ?
You can trust me.
You had Mrs. Tigh's history class, right?
She need us do this family tree, and I thought it was gonna be a good Christmas present for my family, you know, and I'm... and I've found out that my mom's great-grandmother... was black,
which means that my mom is part black, which means that I'm... you didn't know that my mom was an octoroon when you met her, did you?
- You couldn't tell.
- A what?
An octoroon 1/8 black.
And that means that I'm 1/16... black.
Honey, I don't think anybody will ever be able to tell that.
My dad might.
Matt, if I get any darker, then my dad's gonna be able to tell.
Ariel, you're whiter than me.
Well, genetically, I have more melanin in my skin.
And one day, I could start to turn.
I read it online, Matt.
Could you help me bleach my skin?
What?
Yeah.
There's this cream that you can get that whiter skin, and your mom probably has it at the spa, and all you need to do is just get ahold of some...
Honey, that's crazy.
Why?
People do it all the time, it's cosmetic.
Trying to make your skin whiter?
How is that gonna help anything?
Because if my dad finds out that I have black blood in me, he's gonna go ballistic.
I mean, you've seen how he is, and I'm really scared what he's gonna do to me and my mom.
Yeah, but so what if you've got black blood in you from 100 years ago?
That doesn't change who you are now.
- Oh, no?
- No.
Well, what happened when your dad found out 17 years later that you weren't the son that he thought you were?
How did that work out for you?
You must have been a very good boy this year.
Santa brought you an early stuff in stuffer.
Guess who is not the father of Julia's baby ?
- You.
- Ha ha.
Very funny.
Quentin.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I promised Julia...
I wouldn't do that.
He volunteered it.
He said that he never slept with Julia.
You believe him?
Why would he lie?
He's too much of a cock not to crow.
So she must be seeing someone.
She mention anything to you?
No, uh... she hasn't.
Are you sure?
Not even in passing ?
I mean, you know, a friend or somebody new at work, or...
Shit.
Really?
Then who the hell's the father?
Who is the goddamn father?
!
It's a pretty simple question, Joy.
Everything all right in here?
- I knew he wouldn't take it well.
- Take it well ?
She tells me how she walks around with another man's baby inside of her ?
Well, what am I supposed to say... ho, ho, ho?
Let me tell you something.
You with a goddamn "Ho, Joy".
Look, it's difficult news to absorb, Mr. Kringle, but your wife has just been through major surgery, and we need to stay calm.
Oh, I'll be a lot calmer once I get an answer.
It was 17 years ago.
- It was just once.
- Who was it?
!
It was Andy.
My assistant Andy?
He was... he was 18 years old.
He was... he was paying his way through college by working for us.
How could you do that, Joy ?
He paid me some goddamn attention, Wes.
After the doctors told us your sperm was unvailable you just jumped headlong into the whole Santa thing and all the little brats.
Worshipped you, and it was all about them and your career,
I got a little lonely.
I couldn't talk to you.
I still can't.
I'll never get past this, Joy... ever.
You know, Mr. Kringle, I had a similar experience.
Something from the past came up in my marriage, and given all you two have built together,
I'd hate to see rashness prevail here.
It's all been a lie, Joy ?
Our entire marriage?
No, of course not.
But every day isn't Christmas.
Sometimes I don't feel jolly.
I feel like shit.
I'm tired of being Mrs. Santa Claus.
I just want to be myself...
Joy Beckendahl, your normal, moody, middle-aged wife.
Well, I don't think that's possible anymore, Joy.
Maybe there's something to be said for embracing the truth, for living in the reality of a relationship instead of the myth.
Well, here's my reality.
She can be normal little Joy Beckendahl, the ex-Mrs.
Kringle.
Santa's going solo.
If you want, I can give you a gift certificate for Mrs. Alderman came for a massage.
Oh, please, mom.
This is already too much stuff.
As a mother, I can tell you, if you're being invited to spend Christmas Eve at their house, you'd better make a good impression.
Trust me.
Giving Mrs. Alderman this much free swag will leave me impression I'm ready to marry her daughter.
What's Ariel's mom like?
She's nice.
You know, typical mom.
Nothing like you.
I didn't mean that in a bad way.
Sure you didn't.
No.
I meant you're more than just a mother.
You're a big shot businesswoman with a whole new career for yourself.
That's a hell of a lot better than being a stay-at-home mom, right?
Oh, honey, you don't need this.
This is medical-grade skin bleach.
Oh, wow thanks for catching that.
Believe me, if Mrs. Alderman ever put that on by mistake you would never be invited back.
Spa De La Mer.
Thanks.
You're busy.
I'll call you later, ok?
Did you just call me?
Did I?
Um... yeah.
Why did you hang up?
I was chicken.
I was calling to see what you were doing Christmas Eve.
Are you busy?
Sort of.
Uh...
I have an appointment.
And I'll probably want to be alone later.
Maybe you should have someone drive you.
Come on, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it.
All right.
Jeez.
Merry Christmas.
You're silly.
You didn't have to wrap it.
Uh, what is this?
Dr. Sloan is a psychotherapist who specializes in teen image issues.
My grandmother recommandize her.
For what?
I think you need to talk to someone about what you're going through, all this paranoia about being black.
I'm worried.
You know, you're like an anorexic.
Only you can't get white enough.
You are getting way too serious.
Come on, just... where is the cream ?
Look, I am serious, Ariel, I think you need help.
And when did you becoming expert on mental health?
Aha!
Found it!
That's only in there because I'm returning it.
- You can't have it.
- What is your problem?
Yesterday we were having so much fun and you were totally on board in this.
Yeah, well, it's not fun anymore.
You're talking about hurting yourself with something crazy.
Hurting myself ?
They sell this in beauty parlors, Matt.
What's a big deal?
It's stronger than that stuff.
You know what?
If I knew you were gonna be like this,
I would have ordered in my mind.
You think it's working?
How do I look?
A little insane, actually.
You know what?
Screw you, Matt.
I thought you actually understood what I was going though, but you don't.
I should have never trusted you!
Get out!
Fine.
Asshole.
Wait.
Don't leave.
No, I think you're right.
I should go.
My face... it feels like it's on fire.
My face.
How do you make it stop?
It hurts!
How do you make it stop?
!
Re making it worse!
Ok, ok!
Come on!
Is she gonna be ok?
It's nothing worse than a first-degree burn.
You're lucky Matt brought you in as soon as he did.
There should be no permanent scarring.
Thank you by the way.
So I guess plastic surgeons aren't the devil when you need them, huh?
Matt, can I have a word?
You're both very lucky.
If she had a reaction, she'd be in shock right now.
Yeah.
I told her it was a bad idea.
Now, was that before or after you stole the cream from your mother ?
Look, you want to shave your head and ruin your life, that's fine, but when you hurt other people, that's when I have a problem.
Look, I came to you for help, gonna turn into a father/son lecture, then...
Let's stop pretending we have a father/son relationship, shall we?
I'm billing you for my time.
Matt!
Hey...
Ariel.
What... what's going on here?
Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, Matt called me.
What happened to your face?
She had a reaction to a skin-bleaching cream.
Nothing severe.
She's gonna be fine.
Why did you call him?
Because you can't keep hiding this anymore, Ariel.
Hiding what?
What...
How did this happen?
Matt said that I should lighten my freckles, so he stole some bleach cream from his mom's spa, and we put it on my face and I had a reaction.
You did this?
Tell him you told me about the research paper.
Honey, I won't let him hurt you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ariel discovered that her mother, your wife, comes from African lineage but she was so afraid of what you might do that she tried to bleach her skin!
- What?
- Just tell her that being 1/16 black doesn't matter to you.
That your love for her is not based on what color she is.
Is that true?
Of course not.
Dad, I'm not black.
He's just saying this to you because he doesn't want to get in trouble.
- You are a sick person...
- You don't think that I'd ever hurt you, do you, sweetheart ?
Well, I welcome you into our home, and this is how you repay me, by making up these hateful lies?
Mr. Alderman, she'll do something worse next now.
No, my daughter is one of the most confident, strong women that I have ever known, and you couldn't handle that, could you?
So you tried to change her face so that you feel better about yourself.
You know, there's not definitively what he does.
My son saved your daughter from a severe burn.
Now, you can believe your own bullshit if you want to, that's fine.
But unless you want a problem with me,
I suggest you leave now.
As long as your son stays away from my daughter, we have no problem.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because people only believe what they want to.
So, looks like my advice fell on deaf ears.
Oh, I heard you, doctor.
It's just that I hadn't met Circe yet.
Well, that's not quite true.
Joy used to catch us flirting all the time.
Circe work on the Cinnabun near the North Pole.
Well, she's not going to catch you here if that's what you were hoping.
Your wife checked out this morning.
- She did?
- Yes.
Well, so what?
She'll... she'll hear about it, one way or another.
I work with Santa now.
And you work quickly...
Look, doc, all year long it's, uh...
"Gimme an x-box.
Gimme a spongebob."
I spend my life fulfilling other people's wishes.
I'm sure you know something about that.
This year, Santa got himself a present.
Circe here has a fantastic, wonderful Christmas spirit, and I like a rewarder with some double ds.
Come on, doc.
What better way to remote Santa's new image than by showing off his healthy young woman?
Matty.
What are you doing here?
I didn't...
I didn't think you'd be home on Christmas Eve.
Uh, I was just leaving that for you.
It's an I.O.U. 30 hours slave labor... car washes, coffee runs, whatever you need to pay off Ariel's visit.
I'm not exactly liquid right now.
- Merry Christmas.
- You're hungry ?
I just bought a ton of food.
Not a bad way to spend the holidays.
Two single men watching football, eating Chinese, it's America.
How are you doing by the way ?
I don't think about her.
I was proud of what you did earlier.
Standing up to that asshole took guts.
It's not gonna change anything, man.
They'll go on living in lie and no one ever talk about it.
You ever wish you didn't know about me ?
Being your biological father ?
Yeah.
It were certainly easier not knowing.
But, uh...
I'm adjusting.
You?
I'm adjusting, too.
I'm Julia McNamara.
I have a 7:30 appointment.
Just fill this out, Mrs. McNamara.
Rain started yet?
Not yet.
Any minute, though.
Thank you.
Please have a sit, the doctor will be out in a few minutes.
I was thinking... there are the first Christmas Eve alone without the kids in 18 years.
Yes.
Just thinking the same thing.
It' your baby, Sean.
I know.
Mrs. McNamara?
The doctor's ready for you now.
I don't want to do this.
Me neither.
Let's get out of here.
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs. Kringle.
These last 15 pounds.
I've just had no luck getting rid of them.
The first 75 didn't exactly fall off, either.
It's a proven fact that men and women lose fat at different rates.
Why do you always have to compare?
Well, you're the one sneaking all the extra Zone bars, Momma.
That's all I'm saying.
Wesley and I used to both be a lot heavier.
But we went on a liquid diet last spring... and together lost almost 200 pounds.
That's impressive.
Congratulations.
But now the holidays are here... and I've just gotta lose these last few inches before Christmas.
Can lipo help?
Usually we get requests like yours after New Year's... when everyone makes their resolutions.
Oh, we made a resolution a year ago to be at 10% body fat by now.
It was a career choice.
Joy and I, we're the feature attraction... over at the Dolphin Mall during the holidays.
We work as Santa and Mrs. Claus.
With a name like "Kringle," what are the odds?
Oh, it's not a coincidence, Doctor.
Thank you.
We used to be the Mayfields.
But we had our name legally changed back in '91.
I think that's when we started putting on the weight, right?
Well, we were very method back then.
Course, with childhood obesity rates the way they are today... fat is not an image we wanna promote anymore.
The holidays don't have to be about gluttony and overindulgence.
The true spirit of Christmas is about celebration and good cheer.
And studies show... that people are much cheerier if they're healthy.
Now, we try to teach the kids that.
Even our candy canes are sugar-free.
We do this for the children.
We never had any of our own and it ruined the holidays for us.
So one year, as a joke, we dressed up as the Clauses... and we got so much enjoyment out of seeing the kids' faces... we never stopped.
We take it very seriously now.
Does that mean we'll be sending your bill to the North Pole?
Well, we'll...
We can certainly explore the option of micro-lipo.
Although, I have to say, having two kids of my own... that the idea of a trim Santa... seems nontraditional.
You still pad the suit though, right?
I was planning on bringing my daughter by next week.
It's our sincere hope... that by the time your kids have kids, Doctor...
Santa will no longer be thought of as the fat man.
He'll be trim, tight, and a little bit sexy.
What about the elves?
I always felt like that was indentured servitude.
Are you gonna do something about that?
Do you think Mary had sex with God?
Well...
My personal theory is that...
Mary got it on with Joseph before the wedding.
And then when Jesus was born, less than nine months later... she told everyone it was a virgin birth.
That way, no one would know she had sex before she was married.
It'd be pretty tough to get away with that today.
Matt, knock it off.
Although, come to think of it... you and I know someone a lot like the Virgin Mary.
Only, she got pregnant by her husband's best friend before the wedding.
She also told a big old whopper of a lie... and everyone believed it for a very long time.
Yes, but her baby was no son of God.
It was a joke, Mom.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Jesus, you're white as a sheet.
I'm not feeling very...
Oh, okay.
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.
Here.
Come here.
For years I've been recommending you get a flu shot, Julia.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have bothered you but Dr. Edelman's out of town... and I've been feeling really run down.
You've had a rough month.
And it wouldn't be Christmas... if you weren't trying to do more than humanly possible.
At least when I was around you had a little help with all of it.
This will sting a little.
Well, I think you're mythologizing our holidays together, Sean.
What I remember most is nagging you endlessly.
I remember that, too.
Just hold this.
I miss all of it.
So... you guys doing the big turkey dinner thing?
No, not this year.
Matt's been invited to the Aldermans... and Annie's going to Epcot with the Epsteins.
So I imagine you and Quentin will be skiing in Gstaad... or snorkeling in St. Barts then.
I'm not seeing Quentin anymore.
And he's no longer working at the spa.
- He quit?
- I fired him.
Please, Sean.
No paternalistic "I told you sos."
I was just gonna say that...
I'm sorry if that puts a damper on your Christmas.
No, I have a ton of work to do... and this year, Christmas is just another day.
Yeah.
Well, aren't you gonna put the Band-Aid on me?
Right.
Sorry.
What?
I was just thinking that... we should have Linda do a blood panel to make sure you're not anemic.
Yeah.
Fine.
You're the doctor.
This is so wrong.
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think they could put religious stuff on school grounds.
Matt, are you looking at their faces?
They're black.
Jesus was not black.
Hey, they're a little dark-skinned, maybe.
But it's not like they have Afros.
It figures they would be allowed to do this.
Well, if you're that upset, talk to the principal.
Right.
Principal Goldberg?
Matt, she's a Jew.
She doesn't care about Christmas.
She's at home on the 25th eating Chinese food or something.
I mean, if she really cared about this, this wouldn't have happened.
This whole thing is a fairy tale.
Come on, I thought we were skipping last period.
The story of the birth of Jesus is sacred, Matt.
It's the foundation of all Christianity.
Saying that Jesus was a mud baby is like pissing on the Bible.
You're not supposed to take it literally.
The story's for kids.
Jesus is Santa Claus for adults.
Do you know who Santa was before he became the marketing tool he is today?
Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of charity.
But by 1931, Coca-Cola got ahold of him.
He suddenly became this big fat ass in a red suit... flying around with a sleigh and reindeer... totally corrupting the holiday and mocking any religious meaning behind it.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
It's a perfect example of what happens when we don't protect our history.
When we don't protect our truth... it can be rewritten.
We have to do something.
The Messiah?
Liz, I thought you were an atheist.
I kind of go on the wagon around the holidays.
You miss out on too much good music if you don't.
And it puts me in a very forgiving mood.
Well, in that case, I'm glad it's on.
All right, shall we suck the Pringles out of the Kringle?
Oh, sorry, maestro, we started the performance without you.
You okay?
You look like somebody dumped a lump of coal in your stocking.
Julia's pregnant.
- What?
- She came in earlier for a flu shot.
I ran a blood panel as a precautionary measure... and the lab just called and said she was pregnant.
Did you tell her?
Liz, you can't say anything.
I think Julia's gonna be able to figure this out for herself.
How long ago did she and Quentin start seeing each other?
- Shit.
- Yeah.
No, shit, I hit something.
Look.
What does it feel like?
I don't know, like a tumor?
Or a hernia, maybe?
No, that's no hernia.
- What are her vitals?
- Heart rate's increasing.
We're gonna have to open her up.
I'll go talk to Santa.
Linda, we're gonna need a laparotomy tray.
Consent signed.
We're going in.
10-blade.
What the hell is that?
That's not growing out of her uterus, is it?
Oh, my God.
Looks like somebody else didn't realize they were pregnant, either.
Heads up!
- Oh, nice catch.
- I gots the good hands, baby.
Don't I know it.
- Let's go.
- All right.
Yeah.
I know I'm supposed to call, but I took a chance.
I thought you'd want these.
It's the handmade ornaments from when the kids were little.
Great.
One more box of decorations to hang.
Annie said you guys already trimmed the tree.
Yeah, well, you know how it is, Sean.
Everyone starts out with good intentions... and eventually I'm all by myself eating all the cookies... and guessing out loud to Jeopardy.
By the way, have you seen Matt's baby ornament?
I mean, maybe it's in here, but...
I don't know what could have happened to it.
Do you think it's bad luck to lose your baby's first ornament?
Is it like losing your wedding ring?
Julia... the blood panel came back.
You're pregnant.
Pregnant with a...
- What did you call it?
- A lithopedion.
"Litho," meaning "stone." "Pedion" meaning "child."
You had a... petrified fetus inside of you.
How does something like that happen?
At some point you had an undiagnosed pregnancy and the fetus died.
Through some fluke, it remained in your abdominal cavity... and just calcified over time.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
How long has it been in there?
I'd say at least 15 years.
Maybe even 20 due to the level of calcification.
The pathology lab will be much more precise.
I'm sorry, this is kind of hard to believe.
I don't believe it.
The evidence is pretty irrefutable.
I'm not pretending that I'm the Virgin Mary, but what I'm saying is I...
I just didn't expect this.
I have a colleague, a very good doctor who could take care of...
I'm not ready for that conversation, Sean.
I'm just trying to be helpful, Julia.
I'm probably stating the obvious here.
But Quentin is not someone you wanna...
- Please, Sean, don't say any more!
- Do you want this baby?
I always wanted a baby.
Both of us did.
We were told it wasn't a possibility.
Was it a boy or a girl?
After they run all the tests, we'll know more.
The organs weren't visible.
Can I see it before you send it off?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I need to see it.
I need to be alone now, Sean.
You haven't said anything to Quentin, have you?
That's your job, Julia.
I'd never do that.
Are you gonna tell him?
Sorry.
Like I said earlier, I should have called first.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell Santa.
Is that for me?
You shouldn't have.
I'm here for my payout, Christian.
You haven't answered my calls.
- I'll get it off to you in the morning.
- I need it now.
I'm leaving for the holidays in the morning.
All by your lonesome?
Whatever happened to your burgeoning relationship?
What relationship?
I was under the impression that you and Julia...
Julia and I had a parting of the ways.
What was the problem, she didn't have a dick?
I'll tell you something, Christian.
She tried to blow me in her Jacuzzi and I had this epiphany.
If I'm finding this a sad chore, how could I possibly go further?
I had to finish off in the jet.
- So you and Julia never...
- No.
Not once.
I want my money now.
To be honest, I'm thrilled to be writing this check.
It means I'll never have to lay eyes on you again.
What a gift.
Happy holidays.
Matt.
Can you tell that she's still black?
She looks albino.
You know, I was thinking we should water some of this paint down... so that they don't look so cartoonish.
No, I think we're gonna have to do second coats on all these.
They're not white enough.
- You're kidding, right?
- No, I mean, you can tell that she's black.
Look, look.
When the light hits her.
You can definitely tell.
I think people will get the point.
Well, I don't want people to know that there was black underneath there before.
Why is that wrong?
Are you okay?
Do you love me?
- Is that what this is about?
- Do you love me?
Honey...
I just stole the baby Jesus... because you asked me to.
Yes, I love you.
So, if I told you a secret, you'd promise not to tell anyone, right?
You can trust me.
Okay.
You had Mrs. Tigh's history class, right?
Well, she made us do this family tree... and I thought it was gonna be a good Christmas present for my family.
You know?
And...
And then I found out that... my mom's great-grandmother... was black.
Which means that my mom is part black.
Which means that I'm...
You didn't know that my mom was an octoroon when you met her, did you?
- I mean, you couldn't tell?
- No, a what?
An octoroon, one-eighth black.
And that means that I'm one-sixteenth, Matt.
Honey, I don't think anybody will ever be able to tell that.
My dad might.
Matt, if I get any darker, then my dad's gonna be able to tell.
Ariel, you're whiter than me.
Well, genetically, I have more melanin in my skin.
And one day I could start to turn.
I read it online, Matt.
Could you help me bleach my skin?
- What?
- Yeah.
There's this cream... that you can get that whitens your skin and your mom probably has it at the spa.
And all you need to do is just get ahold of some of it...
Honey, that's crazy.
Why?
People do it all the time.
It's cosmetic.
Trying to make your skin whiter.
How is that gonna help anything?
Because if my dad finds out that I have black blood in me... he's gonna go ballistic.
I mean, you've seen how he is... and I'm really scared what he's gonna do to me and my mom.
Yeah, but so what if you've got black blood in you from 100 years ago.
That doesn't change who you are now.
- Oh, no?
- No.
What happened when your dad found out, 17 years later... that you weren't the son that he thought you were?
How did that work out for you?
You must have been a very good boy this year.
Santa brought you an early stocking stuffer.
Guess who is not the father of Julia's baby?
- You.
- Very funny.
Quentin.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I promised Julia...
I wouldn't do that.
He volunteered it.
He said that he never slept with Julia.
You believe him?
Why would he lie?
He's too much of a cock not to crow.
So she must be seeing someone.
She mention anything to you?
No.
She hasn't.
Are you sure?
Not even in passing?
I mean, you know, a friend, or somebody new at work?
Or...
Nope.
Shit.
Really?
Then who the hell's the father?
Who is the goddamn father?
It's a pretty simple question, Joy!
Everything all right in here?
- I knew he wouldn't take it well.
- Take it well?
She tells me how she walks around with another man's baby inside of her!
Well, what am I supposed to say, "Ho, ho, ho"?
Well, let me tell you something, you are the goddamn ho, Joy.
Look, it's difficult news to absorb, Mr. Kringle... but your wife has just been through major surgery... and we need to stay calm.
Oh, I'll be a lot calmer once I get an answer.
It was 17 years ago.
It was just once.
Who was it?
It was Andy.
Andy?
My assistant, Andy?
He was...
He was 18 years old!
He was...
He was paying his way through college by working for us.
How could you do that, Joy?
He paid me some goddamn attention, Wes!
After the doctors told us your sperm wasn't viable... you just jumped headlong into the whole Santa thing... and all the little brats that worshipped you... and it was all about them and your career, and I got a little lonely.
I couldn't talk to you.
I still can't.
I'll never get past this, Joy.
Ever.
You know, Mr. Kringle, I had a similar experience.
Something from the past came up in my marriage and...
Given all you two have built together, I'd hate to see rashness prevail here.
Has it all been a lie, Joy?
Our entire marriage?
No, of course not.
But every day isn't Christmas.
Sometimes I don't feel jolly.
I feel like shit.
I'm tired of being Mrs. Santa Claus.
I just wanna be myself.
Joy Beckendahl, your normal... moody, middle-aged wife.
Well, I don't think that's possible anymore, Joy.
Maybe there's something to be said for embracing the truth... for living in the reality of a relationship instead of the myth.
Yeah.
Here's my reality.
She can be normal little Joy Beckendahl... the ex Mrs. Kringle.
Santa's going solo.
If you want, I can give you a gift certificate... for Mrs. Alderman to come in for a massage.
Oh, please, Mom.
This is already too much stuff.
As a mother, I can tell you... if you're being invited to spend Christmas Eve at their house... you'd better make a good impression.
Mom, trust me, giving Mrs. Alderman this much free swag... will leave the impression that I'm ready to marry her daughter.
What's Ariel's mom like?
She's nice.
You know, typical Mom.
Nothing like you.
I didn't mean that in a bad way.
Sure you didn't.
No, I meant you're more than just a mother.
You're a big-shot business woman with a whole new career for yourself.
I mean, that's a hell of a lot better than being a stay-at-home mom, right?
Oh, honey, you don't need this.
This is medical-grade skin bleach.
Oh, wow.
Thanks for catching that.
Believe me, if Mrs. Alderman ever put that on by mistake... you would never be invited back.
Spa De La Mer.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Thanks.
You're busy.
I'll call you later, okay?
Bye.
Hello.
Did you just call me?
Did I?
Yeah.
Why'd you hang up?
I was chicken.
I was calling to see what you were doing Christmas Eve.
Oh.
Are you busy?
Sort of.
I have an appointment.
No, I'll probably wanna be alone later.
Maybe you should have someone drive you.
Come on.
Let me see it, let me see it, let me see it.
All right.
Easy.
Merry Christmas.
Silly.
You didn't have to wrap it.
What is this?
Dr. Sloan is a psychotherapist who specializes in teen image issues.
My grandmother recommended her.
For what?
I think you need to talk to someone about what you're going through.
All this paranoia about being black.
I'm worried.
You know, you're like an anorexic, only you can't get white enough.
You are getting way too serious.
Come on, just...
Where's the cream?
Look, I am serious, Ariel.
I think you need help.
And when did you become the expert on mental health?
Found it.
Look, that's only in there because I'm returning it.
- You can't have it.
- What is your problem?
Yesterday, we were having so much fun and you were totally on board with this.
Yeah, well, it's not fun anymore.
You're talking about hurting yourself with something crazy.
Hurting myself?
They sell this in beauty parlors, Matt.
- God!
What's the big deal?
- This is stronger than that stuff.
You know what?
If I knew you were gonna be like this, I would have ordered it online.
You think it's working?
How do I look?
A little insane, actually.
You know what?
Screw you, Matt!
I thought you actually understood what I was going through, but you don't!
I should have never trusted you.
Get out!
Fine.
Asshole!
Wait.
Don't leave.
No, I think you're right.
I should go.
- My face, it feels like it's on fire.
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta get out of here!
- Okay.
Okay, baby!
- Stop it hurting.
- Come here.
That hurts!
I thought you would make it stop!
It's going in my pores!
- Okay!
Okay!
- Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
- Baby, I got you.
- Let go!
Let me go!
Is she gonna be okay?
It's nothing worse than a first-degree burn.
You're lucky Matt brought you in as soon as he did.
There should be no permanent scarring.
Thank you, by the way.
So, I guess plastic surgeons aren't the devil when you need them, huh?
Matt, can I have a word?
You're both very lucky.
If she had a reaction, she'd be in shock right now.
Yeah, I told her it was a bad idea.
Now, was that before or after you stole the cream from your mother?
Look, you wanna shave your head and ruin your life, that's fine.
But when you start hurting other people, that's when I have a problem.
Look, I came to you for help.
But if this is gonna turn into a father-son lecture then...
Let's stop pretending we have a father-son relationship, shall we?
Yeah.
I'm billing you for my time.
Matt!
Hey.
Ariel?
What's going on here?
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- Well, Matt called me.
What happened to your face?
She had a reaction to a skin bleaching cream.
Nothing severe.
She's gonna be fine.
Why did you call him?
Because you can't keep hiding this anymore, Ariel.
Hiding what?
What?
How did this happen?
Matt said that I should lighten my freckles... so he stole some bleach cream from his mom's spa... and we put it on my face, and I had a reaction.
You did this?
Tell him what you told me about the research paper.
Honey, I won't let him hurt you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ariel discovered that her mother, your wife, comes from African lineage.
But she was so afraid of what you might do that she tried to bleach her skin.
What?
Just tell her that being one-sixteenth black doesn't matter to you.
That your love for her is not based on what color she is.
- Is that true?
- Of course not.
Dad, I'm not black.
He's just saying this to you because he doesn't wanna get in trouble.
- You are a sick person, Matt.
- You don't think... that I'd ever hurt you, do you, sweetheart?
I welcome you into our home and this is how you repay me?
By making up these hateful lies?
Mr. Alderman, she'll do something worse next time.
No, my daughter is one of the most confident... strong women that I have ever known and you couldn't handle that, could you?
So you tried to change her face so that you'd feel better about yourself.
You know, that's no different than what he does.
My son saved your daughter from a severe burn.
Now, you can believe your own bullshit if you want to, that's fine... but unless you want a problem with me, I suggest you leave now.
As long as your son stays away from my daughter... we have no problem.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because people only believe what they want to.
So, it looks like my advice fell on deaf ears.
Oh, I heard you, Doctor.
It's just that I hadn't met Circe yet.
Well, that's not quite true.
Joy used to catch us flirting all the time.
Circe worked at the Cinnabun near the North Pole.
Well, she's not gonna catch you here if that's what you were hoping.
Your wife checked out this morning.
- She did?
- Yes.
So what?
She'll hear about it one way or another.
- I work with Santa now.
- And you work quickly.
Look, Doc, all year long it's...
"Give me an Xbox." "Give me a SpongeBob."
I spend my life fulfilling other people's wishes.
I'm sure you know something about that.
This year, Santa got himself a present.
Circe here has a fantastic, wonderful Christmas spirit... and I'd like to reward her with some double Ds.
Come on, Doc.
What better way to promote Santa's new image... than by showing off his healthy, young woman?
Matty?
What are you doing here?
I didn't...
I didn't think you'd be home on Christmas Eve.
I was just leaving that for you.
It's an IOU.
Thirty hours slave labor, car washes, coffee runs... whatever you need to pay off Ariel's visit.
I'm not exactly liquid right now.
Merry Christmas.
You hungry?
I just bought a ton of food.
Hand-off to T.J.
He eludes one tackler and surges ahead close to a first down.
He should've lost yardage on that one.
Initial contact made a few yards behind the line of scrimmage.
Just a great run by T.J. Simons.
And that's just perfect smash-mouth football.
Not a bad way to spend the holidays.
No.
Two single men watching football, eating Chinese.
That's America.
How you doing, by the way?
I don't think about her.
I was proud of what you did earlier, standing up to that asshole.
It took guts.
It's not gonna change anything, man.
They'll go on living their lie and no one will ever talk about it.
You ever wish you didn't know about me?
Being your biological father?
Yeah.
It was certainly easier not knowing.
But...
I'm adjusting.
You?
I'm adjusting, too.
I'm Julia McNamara.
I have a 7:30 appointment.
Just fill this out, Mrs. McNamara.
- Rain started yet?
- Not yet.
Any minute though.
Thank you.
Please have a seat.
The doctor will be out in a few minutes.
I was thinking... this is our first Christmas Eve alone without the kids in 18 years.
Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.
It's your baby, Sean.
I know.
Mrs. McNamara, the doctor's ready for you now.
Okay.
- I don't wanna do this.
- Me, neither.
Let's get out of here.
English
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs. Kringle.
These last 15 pounds.
I've just had no luck getting rid of them.
The first 75 didn't exactly fall off, either.
It's a proven fact that men and women lose fat at different rates.
Why do you always have to compare?
You were the one sneaking all the extra zone bars, mama.
That's all I'm saying.
Wesley and I used to both be a lot heavier, but we went on a liquid diet last spring, and together lost almost 200 pounds.
That's impressive.
Congratulations.
But now the holidays are here and
I've just gotta lose these last few inches before Christmas.
Can lipo help?
Usually we get requests like yours after new year's, when everyone makes their resolutions.
Oh, we made a resolution a year ago to be at 10% body fat by now.
It was a career choice.
Joy and I, we're the feature attraction over at the dolphin mall during the holidays.
We work as Santa and Mrs. Claus.
With a name like kringle, what are the odds?
Oh, it's not a coincidence, doctor.
Thank you.
We used to be the Mayfields, but we had our name legally changed back in '91.
I think that's when we started putting on the weight, right?
Well, we were very method back then.
Of course, with childhood obesity rates the way they are today, fat is not an image we want to promote anymore.
The holidays don't have to be about gluttony and overindulgence.
The true spirit of Christmas is about celebration and good cheer, and studies show that people are much cheerier if they're healthy.
Now, we try to teach the kids that.
Even our candy canes are sugar-free.
We do this for the children.
We never had any of our own and it ruined the holidays for us, so one year as a joke, we dressed up as the clauses and we got so much enjoyment out of seeing the kids' faces,
we never stopped.
We take it very seriously now.
Does that mean we'll be sending your bill to the North Pole?
Well, we can certainly explore the option of micro-lipo, although I have to say, having 2 kids of my own, the idea of a trim Santa seems nontraditional.
You still pad the suit, though, right?
I was planning on bringing my daughter by next week.
It's our sincere hope that by the time your kids have kids, doctor,
Santa will no longer be thought of as the fat man.
He'll be trim, tight, and a little bit sexy.
What about the elves?
I always felt like that was indentured servitude.
Are you gonna do something about that?
Do you think Mary had sex with God?
Well, um, my personal theory is that Mary got it on with Joseph before the wedding, and then when Jesus was born less than 9 months later, she told everyone it was a virgin birth.
That way, no one would know she had sex before she was married.
It would be pretty tough to get away with that today.
Matt, knock it off.
Although, come to think of it, you and I know someone a lot like the virgin Mary, only she got pregnant by her husband's best friend before the wedding.
She also told a big old whopper of a lie, and everyone believed it for a very long time.
Yes, but her baby was no son of God.
It was a joke, mom.
I'm sorry.
Jesus, you're white as a sheet.
Uh, I'm not feeling very...
Oh, ok.
Hey, whoa.
I got you.
I got you, I got you.
Here, come here.
For years, I've been recommending you get a flu shot, Julia.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have bothered you, but Dr. Edelman's out of town, and...
I've been feeling really run down.
Well, you've had a rough month.
And it wouldn't be Christmas if you weren't trying to do more than humanly possible.
At least when I was around, you had a little help with all of it.
This will sting a little.
I think you're mythologizing our holidays together, Sean.
What I remember most is nagging you endlessly.
I remember that, too.
Just hold this.
I miss all of it.
Uh, so, you guys doing the big turkey dinner thing?
No.
Not this year.
Matt's been invited to the Aldermans and Annie's going to Epcot with the Epsteins.
So I imagine you and Quentin will be skiing in Gstaad or snorkeling in St. Bart's, then.
I'm not seeing Quentin anymore.
And he's no longer working at the spa.
- He quit?
- I fired him.
Please, Sean, no paternalistic I told you so's.
I was just gonna say that
I'm sorry if that puts a damper on your Christmas.
No.
I have a ton of work to do, and this year, Christmas is just another day.
Yeah.
Well, aren't you gonna put the band-aid on me?
Right.
Sorry.
What?
I was just thinking that... that we should have Linda do a blood panel, make sure you're not anemic.
Yeah.
Fine.
You're the doctor.
This is so wrong.
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think they could put religious stuff on school grounds.
Matt, are you looking at their faces?
They're black!
Jesus was not black.
They're a little dark-skinned, maybe, but it's not like they have afros.
Huh.
It figures they would be allowed to do this.
Well, if you're that upset, talk to the principal.
Right.
Principal Goldberg?
Matt, she's a jew.
She doesn't care about Christmas.
She's at home on the 25th eating chinese food or something.
I mean, if she really cared about this, this wouldn't have happened.
This whole thing is a fairy tale.
Come on.
I thought we were skipping last period.
The story of the birth of Jesus is sacred, Matt.
It's the foundation of all christianity.
Saying that Jesus was a mud baby is like pissing on the bible.
You're not supposed to take it literally.
The story's for kids.
Jesus is Santa Claus for adults.
Do you know who Santa was before he became the marketing tool he's today ?
St. Nicholas, the patron saint of charity.
But by 1930, when Coca-Cola got ahold of him, he suddenly became this big fat-ass in a red suit, flying around with a sleigh and reindeer, totally corrupting the holiday and mocking any religious meaning behind it.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
It's a perfect example of what happens when we don't protect our history.
When we don't protect our truth, it can be rewritten.
We have to do something.
The messiah?
Liz, I thought you were an atheist.
I kind of go on the wagon around the holidays.
You miss out on too much good music if you don't.
And it puts me in a very forgiving mood.
Well, in that case, I'm glad it's on.
All right.
Shall we suck the pringles out of the kringle?
Oh, sorry, maestro.
We started the performance without you.
Are you ok?
You look like somebody dumped a lump of coal in your stocking.
Julia's pregnant.
What?
She came in earlier for a flu shot,
I ran a blood panel as a precautionary measure, and the lab just called and said she was pregnant.
Did you tell her?
Liz, you can't say anything.
I think Julia's gonna be able to figure this out for herself.
How long ago did she and Quentin start seeing each other?
- Shit.
- Yeah.
No, shit, I hit something.
Look.
What does it feel like?
I don't know.
Like a tumor or a hernia, maybe?
That's no hernia.
What are her vitals?
Heart rate's increasing.
We're gonna have to open her up.
I'll go talk to Santa.
All right, we're gonna need a laparotomy tray.
Consent signed.
We're going in.
10 blade.
What the hell is that?
That's not growing out of her uterus, is it?
Oh, my god.
It looks like somebody else didn't realize they were pregnant, either.
Heads up.
- Nice catch.
- I gots the good hands, baby.
Oh, don't I know it.
We have to do it, I guess.
I know I'm supposed to call, but I... took a chance.
I thought you'd want these.
It's the handmad ornaments for when the kids were little.
Great.
One more box of decorations to hang.
Annie said you guys already trimmed the tree.
Yeah, well, you know how it is, Sean.
Everyone starts out with good intentions.
Than eventually I'm all by myself, eating all the cookies and guessing out loud to Jeopardy.
By the way, have you seen Matt's baby ornament?
I mean, maybe it's in here, but
I don't know what could have happened to it.
Do you think it's bad luck to lose your baby's first ornament?
Is that like losing your wedding ring?
Julia, the blood panel came back.
You're pregnant.
Pregnant with a...
what did you call it?
A lithopedion.
Litho meaning stone, pedion meaning child.
You had a... petrified fetus inside of you.
How does something like that happen?
At some point, you had an undiagnose pregnancy and the fetus died.
Through some fluke, it remained in your abdominal cavity and just calcified overtime.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
How long has it been in there?
I'd say at least 15 years, maybe even 20 due to the level of calcification.
The pathology lab will be much more precise.
I'm sorry.
This is kind of hard to believe.
I don't believe it.
The evidence is pretty irrefutable.
I'm not pretending that I'm the virgin Mary, but what I'm saying is that...
I just didn't expect this.
I have a colleague, a very good doctor who could take care...
I'm not ready for that conversation, Sean.
I'm just trying to be helpful, Julia.
I'm probably state it obviously here, but Quentin is not someone you want...
- Please Sean, don't say any more.
- Do you want this baby?
I always wanted a baby.
Both of us did.
We were told it wasn't a possibility.
Was it a boy or a girl?
After they run all the tests, we'll know more.
The organs weren't visible.
Can I see it before it's sended off?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I need to see it.
I need to be alone now, Sean.
You haven't said anything to Quentin, have you?
That's your job, Julia.
I'd never do that.
Are you gonna tell him?
Sorry.
Like I said earlier, I should have call first.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell Santa.
Is that for me?
You shouldn't have.
I'm here for my payout, Christian.
You haven't answered my calls.
I'll get it off in the morning.
I need it now.
I'm leaving for the holidays in the morning.
All by your lonesome?
Whatever happened to your burgeoning relationship?
What relationship?
I was under the impression that you and Julia...
Julia and I had a parting of the ways.
What was the problem, she didn't have a dick?
I'll tell you something, Christian.
She tried to blow me in her jacuzi and I had this epiphany.
If I'm finding this the sad chore, how could I possibly go further?
I had to finish off in the jet.
- So you and Julia never...
- No.
Not once.
I want my money now.
To be honest, I'm thrilled to be writing this check.
It means I'll never have to lay eyes on you again.
What a gift.
Happy holidays.
Can you tell that she's still black?
She looks albino.
You know, I was, uh...
I was thinking we should water some of this paint down so that they don't like so cartoonish.
No.
I think we're gonna have to do second coats on all these.
They're not white enough.
You're kidding, right?
No.
I mean, you can tell that she's black.
Look, when the light hits her, you can definitely tell.
I think people will get the point.
I don't want people to know that they were black underneath there before.
Why is that wrong?
Are you ok?
Do you love me?
- Is that what this is about?
- Do you love me ?
Honey, I just stole the baby Jesus because you asked me to.
Yes, I love you.
So if I told you a secret, you'd promise not to tell anyone, right ?
You can trust me.
You had Mrs. Tigh's history class, right?
She need us do this family tree, and I thought it was gonna be a good Christmas present for my family, you know, and I'm... and I've found out that my mom's great-grandmother... was black,
which means that my mom is part black, which means that I'm... you didn't know that my mom was an octoroon when you met her, did you?
- You couldn't tell.
- A what?
An octoroon 1/8 black.
And that means that I'm 1/16... black.
Honey, I don't think anybody will ever be able to tell that.
My dad might.
Matt, if I get any darker, then my dad's gonna be able to tell.
Ariel, you're whiter than me.
Well, genetically, I have more melanin in my skin.
And one day, I could start to turn.
I read it online, Matt.
Could you help me bleach my skin?
What?
Yeah.
There's this cream that you can get that whiter skin, and your mom probably has it at the spa, and all you need to do is just get ahold of some...
Honey, that's crazy.
Why?
People do it all the time, it's cosmetic.
Trying to make your skin whiter?
How is that gonna help anything?
Because if my dad finds out that I have black blood in me, he's gonna go ballistic.
I mean, you've seen how he is, and I'm really scared what he's gonna do to me and my mom.
Yeah, but so what if you've got black blood in you from 100 years ago?
That doesn't change who you are now.
- Oh, no?
- No.
Well, what happened when your dad found out 17 years later that you weren't the son that he thought you were?
How did that work out for you?
You must have been a very good boy this year.
Santa brought you an early stuff in stuffer.
Guess who is not the father of Julia's baby ?
- You.
- Ha ha.
Very funny.
Quentin.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I promised Julia...
I wouldn't do that.
He volunteered it.
He said that he never slept with Julia.
You believe him?
Why would he lie?
He's too much of a cock not to crow.
So she must be seeing someone.
She mention anything to you?
No, uh... she hasn't.
Are you sure?
Not even in passing ?
I mean, you know, a friend or somebody new at work, or...
Shit.
Really?
Then who the hell's the father?
Who is the goddamn father?
!
It's a pretty simple question, Joy.
Everything all right in here?
- I knew he wouldn't take it well.
- Take it well ?
She tells me how she walks around with another man's baby inside of her ?
Well, what am I supposed to say... ho, ho, ho?
Let me tell you something.
You with a goddamn "Ho, Joy".
Look, it's difficult news to absorb, Mr. Kringle, but your wife has just been through major surgery, and we need to stay calm.
Oh, I'll be a lot calmer once I get an answer.
It was 17 years ago.
- It was just once.
- Who was it?
!
It was Andy.
My assistant Andy?
He was... he was 18 years old.
He was... he was paying his way through college by working for us.
How could you do that, Joy ?
He paid me some goddamn attention, Wes.
After the doctors told us your sperm was unvailable you just jumped headlong into the whole Santa thing and all the little brats.
Worshipped you, and it was all about them and your career,
I got a little lonely.
I couldn't talk to you.
I still can't.
I'll never get past this, Joy... ever.
You know, Mr. Kringle, I had a similar experience.
Something from the past came up in my marriage, and given all you two have built together,
I'd hate to see rashness prevail here.
It's all been a lie, Joy ?
Our entire marriage?
No, of course not.
But every day isn't Christmas.
Sometimes I don't feel jolly.
I feel like shit.
I'm tired of being Mrs. Santa Claus.
I just want to be myself...
Joy Beckendahl, your normal, moody, middle-aged wife.
Well, I don't think that's possible anymore, Joy.
Maybe there's something to be said for embracing the truth, for living in the reality of a relationship instead of the myth.
Well, here's my reality.
She can be normal little Joy Beckendahl, the ex-Mrs.
Kringle.
Santa's going solo.
If you want, I can give you a gift certificate for Mrs. Alderman came for a massage.
Oh, please, mom.
This is already too much stuff.
As a mother, I can tell you, if you're being invited to spend Christmas Eve at their house, you'd better make a good impression.
Trust me.
Giving Mrs. Alderman this much free swag will leave me impression I'm ready to marry her daughter.
What's Ariel's mom like?
She's nice.
You know, typical mom.
Nothing like you.
I didn't mean that in a bad way.
Sure you didn't.
No.
I meant you're more than just a mother.
You're a big shot businesswoman with a whole new career for yourself.
That's a hell of a lot better than being a stay-at-home mom, right?
Oh, honey, you don't need this.
This is medical-grade skin bleach.
Oh, wow thanks for catching that.
Believe me, if Mrs. Alderman ever put that on by mistake you would never be invited back.
Spa De La Mer.
Thanks.
You're busy.
I'll call you later, ok?
Did you just call me?
Did I?
Um... yeah.
Why did you hang up?
I was chicken.
I was calling to see what you were doing Christmas Eve.
Are you busy?
Sort of.
Uh...
I have an appointment.
And I'll probably want to be alone later.
Maybe you should have someone drive you.
Come on, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it.
All right.
Jeez.
Merry Christmas.
You're silly.
You didn't have to wrap it.
Uh, what is this?
Dr. Sloan is a psychotherapist who specializes in teen image issues.
My grandmother recommandize her.
For what?
I think you need to talk to someone about what you're going through, all this paranoia about being black.
I'm worried.
You know, you're like an anorexic.
Only you can't get white enough.
You are getting way too serious.
Come on, just... where is the cream ?
Look, I am serious, Ariel, I think you need help.
And when did you becoming expert on mental health?
Aha!
Found it!
That's only in there because I'm returning it.
- You can't have it.
- What is your problem?
Yesterday we were having so much fun and you were totally on board in this.
Yeah, well, it's not fun anymore.
You're talking about hurting yourself with something crazy.
Hurting myself ?
They sell this in beauty parlors, Matt.
What's a big deal?
It's stronger than that stuff.
You know what?
If I knew you were gonna be like this,
I would have ordered in my mind.
You think it's working?
How do I look?
A little insane, actually.
You know what?
Screw you, Matt.
I thought you actually understood what I was going though, but you don't.
I should have never trusted you!
Get out!
Fine.
Asshole.
Wait.
Don't leave.
No, I think you're right.
I should go.
My face... it feels like it's on fire.
My face.
How do you make it stop?
It hurts!
How do you make it stop?
!
Re making it worse!
Ok, ok!
Come on!
Is she gonna be ok?
It's nothing worse than a first-degree burn.
You're lucky Matt brought you in as soon as he did.
There should be no permanent scarring.
Thank you by the way.
So I guess plastic surgeons aren't the devil when you need them, huh?
Matt, can I have a word?
You're both very lucky.
If she had a reaction, she'd be in shock right now.
Yeah.
I told her it was a bad idea.
Now, was that before or after you stole the cream from your mother ?
Look, you want to shave your head and ruin your life, that's fine, but when you hurt other people, that's when I have a problem.
Look, I came to you for help, gonna turn into a father/son lecture, then...
Let's stop pretending we have a father/son relationship, shall we?
I'm billing you for my time.
Matt!
Hey...
Ariel.
What... what's going on here?
Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, Matt called me.
What happened to your face?
She had a reaction to a skin-bleaching cream.
Nothing severe.
She's gonna be fine.
Why did you call him?
Because you can't keep hiding this anymore, Ariel.
Hiding what?
What...
How did this happen?
Matt said that I should lighten my freckles, so he stole some bleach cream from his mom's spa, and we put it on my face and I had a reaction.
You did this?
Tell him you told me about the research paper.
Honey, I won't let him hurt you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ariel discovered that her mother, your wife, comes from African lineage but she was so afraid of what you might do that she tried to bleach her skin!
- What?
- Just tell her that being 1/16 black doesn't matter to you.
That your love for her is not based on what color she is.
Is that true?
Of course not.
Dad, I'm not black.
He's just saying this to you because he doesn't want to get in trouble.
- You are a sick person...
- You don't think that I'd ever hurt you, do you, sweetheart ?
Well, I welcome you into our home, and this is how you repay me, by making up these hateful lies?
Mr. Alderman, she'll do something worse next now.
No, my daughter is one of the most confident, strong women that I have ever known, and you couldn't handle that, could you?
So you tried to change her face so that you feel better about yourself.
You know, there's not definitively what he does.
My son saved your daughter from a severe burn.
Now, you can believe your own bullshit if you want to, that's fine.
But unless you want a problem with me,
I suggest you leave now.
As long as your son stays away from my daughter, we have no problem.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because people only believe what they want to.
So, looks like my advice fell on deaf ears.
Oh, I heard you, doctor.
It's just that I hadn't met Circe yet.
Well, that's not quite true.
Joy used to catch us flirting all the time.
Circe work on the Cinnabun near the North Pole.
Well, she's not going to catch you here if that's what you were hoping.
Your wife checked out this morning.
- She did?
- Yes.
Well, so what?
She'll... she'll hear about it, one way or another.
I work with Santa now.
And you work quickly...
Look, doc, all year long it's, uh...
"Gimme an x-box.
Gimme a spongebob."
I spend my life fulfilling other people's wishes.
I'm sure you know something about that.
This year, Santa got himself a present.
Circe here has a fantastic, wonderful Christmas spirit, and I like a rewarder with some double ds.
Come on, doc.
What better way to remote Santa's new image than by showing off his healthy young woman?
Matty.
What are you doing here?
I didn't...
I didn't think you'd be home on Christmas Eve.
Uh, I was just leaving that for you.
It's an I.O.U. 30 hours slave labor... car washes, coffee runs, whatever you need to pay off Ariel's visit.
I'm not exactly liquid right now.
- Merry Christmas.
- You're hungry ?
I just bought a ton of food.
Not a bad way to spend the holidays.
Two single men watching football, eating Chinese, it's America.
How are you doing by the way ?
I don't think about her.
I was proud of what you did earlier.
Standing up to that asshole took guts.
It's not gonna change anything, man.
They'll go on living in lie and no one ever talk about it.
You ever wish you didn't know about me ?
Being your biological father ?
Yeah.
It were certainly easier not knowing.
But, uh...
I'm adjusting.
You?
I'm adjusting, too.
I'm Julia McNamara.
I have a 7:30 appointment.
Just fill this out, Mrs. McNamara.
Rain started yet?
Not yet.
Any minute, though.
Thank you.
Please have a sit, the doctor will be out in a few minutes.
I was thinking... there are the first Christmas Eve alone without the kids in 18 years.
Yes.
Just thinking the same thing.
It' your baby, Sean.
I know.
Mrs. McNamara?
The doctor's ready for you now.
I don't want to do this.
Me neither.
Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Mrs. Kringle.
These last 15 pounds.
I've just had no luck getting rid of them.
The first 75 didn't exactly fall off, either.
It's a proven fact that men and women lose fat at different rates.
Why do you always have to compare?
You were the one sneaking all the extra zone bars, mama.
That's all I'm saying.
Wesley and I used to both be a lot heavier, but we went on a liquid diet last spring, and together lost almost 200 pounds.
That's impressive.
Congratulations.
But now the holidays are here and
I've just gotta lose these last few inches before Christmas.
Can lipo help?
Usually we get requests like yours after new year's, when everyone makes their resolutions.
Oh, we made a resolution a year ago to be at 10% body fat by now.
It was a career choice.
Joy and I, we're the feature attraction over at the dolphin mall during the holidays.
We work as Santa and Mrs. Claus.
With a name like kringle, what are the odds?
Oh, it's not a coincidence, doctor.
Thank you.
We used to be the Mayfields, but we had our name legally changed back in '91.
I think that's when we started putting on the weight, right?
Well, we were very method back then.
Of course, with childhood obesity rates the way they are today, fat is not an image we want to promote anymore.
The holidays don't have to be about gluttony and overindulgence.
The true spirit of Christmas is about celebration and good cheer, and studies show that people are much cheerier if they're healthy.
Now, we try to teach the kids that.
Even our candy canes are sugar-free.
We do this for the children.
We never had any of our own and it ruined the holidays for us, so one year as a joke, we dressed up as the clauses and we got so much enjoyment out of seeing the kids' faces,
we never stopped.
We take it very seriously now.
Does that mean we'll be sending your bill to the North Pole?
Well, we can certainly explore the option of micro-lipo, although I have to say, having 2 kids of my own, the idea of a trim Santa seems nontraditional.
You still pad the suit, though, right?
I was planning on bringing my daughter by next week.
It's our sincere hope that by the time your kids have kids, doctor,
Santa will no longer be thought of as the fat man.
He'll be trim, tight, and a little bit sexy.
What about the elves?
I always felt like that was indentured servitude.
Are you gonna do something about that?
Do you think Mary had sex with God?
Well, um, my personal theory is that Mary got it on with Joseph before the wedding, and then when Jesus was born less than 9 months later, she told everyone it was a virgin birth.
That way, no one would know she had sex before she was married.
It would be pretty tough to get away with that today.
Matt, knock it off.
Although, come to think of it, you and I know someone a lot like the virgin Mary, only she got pregnant by her husband's best friend before the wedding.
She also told a big old whopper of a lie, and everyone believed it for a very long time.
Yes, but her baby was no son of God.
It was a joke, mom.
I'm sorry.
Jesus, you're white as a sheet.
Uh, I'm not feeling very...
Oh, ok.
Hey, whoa.
I got you.
I got you, I got you.
Here, come here.
For years, I've been recommending you get a flu shot, Julia.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't have bothered you, but Dr. Edelman's out of town, and...
I've been feeling really run down.
Well, you've had a rough month.
And it wouldn't be Christmas if you weren't trying to do more than humanly possible.
At least when I was around, you had a little help with all of it.
This will sting a little.
I think you're mythologizing our holidays together, Sean.
What I remember most is nagging you endlessly.
I remember that, too.
Just hold this.
I miss all of it.
Uh, so, you guys doing the big turkey dinner thing?
No.
Not this year.
Matt's been invited to the Aldermans and Annie's going to Epcot with the Epsteins.
So I imagine you and Quentin will be skiing in Gstaad or snorkeling in St. Bart's, then.
I'm not seeing Quentin anymore.
And he's no longer working at the spa.
- He quit?
- I fired him.
Please, Sean, no paternalistic I told you so's.
I was just gonna say that
I'm sorry if that puts a damper on your Christmas.
No.
I have a ton of work to do, and this year, Christmas is just another day.
Yeah.
Well, aren't you gonna put the band-aid on me?
R ight.
Sorry.
What?
I was just thinking that... that we should have Linda do a blood panel, make sure you're not anemic.
Y eah.
Fine.
You're the doctor.
This is so wrong.
Yeah, I know.
I didn't think they could put religious stuff on school grounds.
Matt, are you looking at their faces?
They're black!
Jesus was not black.
They're a little dark-skinned, maybe, but it's not like they have afros.
Huh.
It figures they would be allowed to do this.
Well, if you're that upset, talk to the principal.
Right.
Principal Goldberg?
Matt, she's a jew.
She doesn't care about Christmas.
She's at home on the 25th eating chinese food or something.
I mean, if she really cared about this, this wouldn't have happened.
This whole thing is a fairy tale.
Come on.
I thought we were skipping last period.
The story of the birth of Jesus is sacred, Matt.
It's the foundation of all christianity.
Saying that Jesus was a mud baby is like pissing on the bible.
You're not supposed to take it literally.
The story's for kids.
Jesus is Santa Claus for adults.
Do you know who Santa was before he became the marketing tool he's today ?
St. Nicholas, the patron saint of charity.
But by 1930, when Coca-Cola got ahold of him, he suddenly became this big fat-ass in a red suit, flying around with a sleigh and reindeer, totally corrupting the holiday and mocking any religious meaning behind it.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
It's a perfect example of what happens when we don't protect our history.
When we don't protect our truth, it can be rewritten.
We have to do something.
The messiah?
Liz, I thought you were an atheist.
I kind of go on the wagon around the holidays.
You miss out on too much good music if you don't.
And it puts me in a very forgiving mood.
Well, in that case, I'm glad it's on.
All right.
Shall we suck the pringles out of the kringle?
Oh, sorry, maestro.
We started the performance without you.
Are you ok?
You look like somebody dumped a lump of coal in your stocking.
Julia's pregnant.
What?
She came in earlier for a flu shot,
I ran a blood panel as a precautionary measure, and the lab just called and said she was pregnant.
Did you tell her?
Liz, you can't say anything.
I think Julia's gonna be able to figure this out for herself.
How long ago did she and Quentin start seeing each other?
- Shit.
- Yeah.
No, shit, I hit something.
Look.
What does it feel like?
I don't know.
Like a tumor or a hernia, maybe?
That's no hernia.
What are her vitals?
Heart rate's increasing.
We're gonna have to open her up.
I'll go talk to Santa.
All right, we're gonna need a laparotomy tray.
Consent signed.
We're going in.
10 blade.
What the hell is that?
That's not growing out of her uterus, is it?
Oh, my God.
It looks like somebody else didn't realize they were pregnant, either.
Heads up.
- Nice catch.
- I gots the good hands, baby.
Oh, don't I know it.
We have to do it, I guess.
I know I'm supposed to call, but I... took a chance.
I thought you'd want these.
It's the handmad ornaments for when the kids were little.
Great.
One more box of decorations to hang.
Annie said you guys already trimmed the tree.
Yeah, well, you know how it is, Sean.
Everyone starts out with good intentions.
Than eventually I'm all by myself, eating all the cookies and guessing out loud to Jeopardy.
By the way, have you seen Matt's baby ornament?
I mean, maybe it's in here, but
I don't know what could have happened to it.
Do you think it's bad luck to lose your baby's first ornament?
Is that like losing your wedding ring?
Julia, the blood panel came back.
You're pregnant.
Pregnant with a...
what did you call it?
A lithopedion.
Litho meaning stone, pedion meaning child.
You had a... petrified fetus inside of you.
How does something like that happen?
At some point, you had an undiagnose pregnancy and the fetus died.
Through some fluke, it remained in your abdominal cavity and just calcified overtime.
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
How long has it been in there?
I'd say at least 15 years, maybe even 20 due to the level of calcification.
The pathology lab will be much more precise.
I'm sorry.
This is kind of hard to believe.
I don't believe it.
The evidence is pretty irrefutable.
I'm not pretending that I'm the virgin Mary, but what I'm saying is that...
I just didn't expect this.
I have a colleague, a very good doctor who could take care...
I'm not ready for that conversation, Sean.
I'm just trying to be helpful, Julia.
I'm probably state it obviously here, but Quentin is not someone you want...
- Please Sean, don't say any more.
- Do you want this baby?
I always wanted a baby.
Both of us did.
We were told it wasn't a possibility.
Was it a boy or a girl?
After they run all the tests, we'll know more.
The organs weren't visible.
Can I see it before it's sended off?
I don't think that's a good idea.
I need to see it.
I need to be alone now, Sean.
You haven't said anything to Quentin, have you?
That's your job, Julia.
I'd never do that.
Are you gonna tell him?
Sorry.
Like I said earlier, I should have call first.
I don't know how I'm gonna tell Santa.
Is that for me?
You shouldn't have.
I'm here for my payout, Christian.
You haven't answered my calls.
I'll get it off in the morning.
I need it now.
I'm leaving for the holidays in the morning.
All by your lonesome?
Whatever happened to your burgeoning relationship?
What relationship?
I was under the impression that you and Julia...
Julia and I had a parting of the ways.
What was the problem, she didn't have a dick?
I'll tell you something, Christian.
She tried to blow me in her jacuzi and I had this epiphany.
If I'm finding this the sad chore, how could I possibly go further?
I had to finish off in the jet.
- So you and Julia never...
- No.
Not once.
I want my money now.
To be honest, I'm thrilled to be writing this check.
It means I'll never have to lay eyes on you again.
What a gift.
Happy holidays.
Can you tell that she's still black?
She looks albino.
You know, I was, uh...
I was thinking we should water some of this paint down so that they don't like so cartoonish.
No.
I think we're gonna have to do second coats on all these.
They're not white enough.
You're kidding, right?
No.
I mean, you can tell that she's black.
Look, when the light hits her, you can definitely tell.
I think people will get the point.
I don't want people to know that they were black underneath there before.
Why is that wrong?
Are you ok?
Do you love me?
- Is that what this is about?
- Do you love me ?
Honey, I just stole the baby Jesus because you asked me to.
Yes, I love you.
So if I told you a secret, you'd promise not to tell anyone, right ?
You can trust me.
You had Mrs. Tigh's history class, right?
She need us do this family tree, and I thought it was gonna be a good Christmas present for my family, you know, and I'm... and I've found out that my mom's great-grandmother... was black,
which means that my mom is part black, which means that I'm... you didn't know that my mom was an octoroon when you met her, did you?
- You couldn't tell.
- A what?
An octoroon 1/8 black.
And that means that I'm 1/16... black.
Honey, I don't think anybody will ever be able to tell that.
My dad might.
Matt, if I get any darker, then my dad's gonna be able to tell.
Ariel, you're whiter than me.
Well, genetically, I have more melanin in my skin.
And one day, I could start to turn.
I read it online, Matt.
Could you help me bleach my skin?
What?
Yeah.
There's this cream that you can get that whiter skin, and your mom probably has it at the spa, and all you need to do is just get ahold of some...
Honey, that's crazy.
Why?
People do it all the time, it's cosmetic.
Trying to make your skin whiter?
How is that gonna help anything?
Because if my dad finds out that I have black blood in me, he's gonna go ballistic.
I mean, you've seen how he is, and I'm really scared what he's gonna do to me and my mom.
Yeah, but so what if you've got black blood in you from 100 years ago?
That doesn't change who you are now.
- Oh, no?
- No.
Well, what happened when your dad found out 17 years later that you weren't the son that he thought you were?
How did that work out for you?
You must have been a very good boy this year.
Santa brought you an early stuff in stuffer.
Guess who is not the father of Julia's baby ?
- You.
- Ha ha.
Very funny.
Quentin.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I promised Julia...
I wouldn't do that.
He volunteered it.
He said that he never slept with Julia.
You believe him?
Why would he lie?
He's too much of a cock not to crow.
So she must be seeing someone.
She mention anything to you?
No, uh... she hasn't.
Are you sure?
Not even in passing ?
I mean, you know, a friend or somebody new at work, or...
Shit.
Really?
Then who the hell's the father?
Who is the goddamn father?
!
It's a pretty simple question, Joy.
Everything all right in here?
- I knew he wouldn't take it well.
- Take it well ?
She tells me how she walks around with another man's baby inside of her ?
Well, what am I supposed to say... ho, ho, ho?
Let me tell you something.
You with a goddamn "Ho, Joy".
Look, it's difficult news to absorb, Mr. Kringle, but your wife has just been through major surgery, and we need to stay calm.
Oh, I'll be a lot calmer once I get an answer.
It was 17 years ago.
- It was just once.
- Who was it?
!
It was Andy.
My assistant Andy?
He was... he was 18 years old.
He was... he was paying his way through college by working for us.
How could you do that, Joy ?
He paid me some goddamn attention, Wes.
After the doctors told us your sperm was unvailable you just jumped headlong into the whole Santa thing and all the little brats.
Worshipped you, and it was all about them and your career,
I got a little lonely.
I couldn't talk to you.
I still can't.
I'll never get past this, Joy... ever.
You know, Mr. Kringle, I had a similar experience.
Something from the past came up in my marriage, and given all you two have built together,
I'd hate to see rashness prevail here.
It's all been a lie, Joy ?
Our entire marriage?
No, of course not.
But every day isn't Christmas.
Sometimes I don't feel jolly.
I feel like shit.
I'm tired of being Mrs. Santa Claus.
I just want to be myself...
Joy Beckendahl, your normal, moody, middle-aged wife.
Well, I don't think that's possible anymore, Joy.
Maybe there's something to be said for embracing the truth, for living in the reality of a relationship instead of the myth.
Well, here's my reality.
She can be normal little Joy Beckendahl, the ex-Mrs.
Kringle.
Santa's going solo.
If you want, I can give you a gift certificate for Mrs. Alderman came for a massage.
Oh, please, mom.
This is already too much stuff.
As a mother, I can tell you, if you're being invited to spend Christmas Eve at their house, you'd better make a good impression.
Trust me.
Giving Mrs. Alderman this much free swag will leave me impression I'm ready to marry her daughter.
What's Ariel's mom like?
She's nice.
You know, typical mom.
Nothing like you.
I didn't mean that in a bad way.
Sure you didn't.
No.
I meant you're more than just a mother.
You're a big shot businesswoman with a whole new career for yourself.
That's a hell of a lot better than being a stay-at-home mom, right?
Oh, honey, you don't need this.
This is medical-grade skin bleach.
Oh, wow thanks for catching that.
Believe me, if Mrs. Alderman ever put that on by mistake you would never be invited back.
Spa De La Mer.
Thanks.
You're busy.
I'll call you later, ok?
Did you just call me?
Did I?
Um... yeah.
Why did you hang up?
I was chicken.
I was calling to see what you were doing Christmas Eve.
Are you busy?
Sort of.
Uh...
I have an appointment.
And I'll probably want to be alone later.
Maybe you should have someone drive you.
Come on, let me see it, let me see it, let me see it.
All right.
Jeez.
Merry Christmas.
You're silly.
You didn't have to wrap it.
Uh, what is this?
Dr. Sloan is a psychotherapist who specializes in teen image issues.
My grandmother recommended her.
For what?
I think you need to talk to someone about what you're going through, all this paranoia about being black.
I'm worried.
You know, you're like an anorexic.
Only you can't get white enough.
You are getting way too serious.
Come on, just... where is the cream ?
Look, I am serious, Ariel, I think you need help.
And when did you becoming expert on mental health?
Aha!
Found it!
That's only in there because I'm returning it.
- You can't have it.
- What is your problem?
Yesterday we were having so much fun and you were totally on board in this.
Yeah, well, it's not fun anymore.
You're talking about hurting yourself with something crazy.
Hurting myself ?
They sell this in beauty parlors, Matt.
What's a big deal?
It's stronger than that stuff.
You know what?
If I knew you were gonna be like this,
I would have ordered in my mind.
You think it's working?
How do I look?
A little insane, actually.
You know what?
Screw you, Matt.
I thought you actually understood what I was going though, but you don't.
I should have never trusted you!
Get out!
Fine.
Asshole.
Wait.
Don't leave.
No, I think you're right.
I should go.
My face... it feels like it's on fire.
My face.
How do you make it stop?
It hurts!
How do you make it stop?
!
Re making it worse!
Ok, ok!
Come on!
Is she gonna be ok?
It's nothing worse than a first-degree burn.
You're lucky Matt brought you in as soon as he did.
There should be no permanent scarring.
Thank you by the way.
So I guess plastic surgeons aren't the devil when you need them, huh?
Matt, can I have a word?
You're both very lucky.
If she had a reaction, she'd be in shock right now.
Yeah.
I told her it was a bad idea.
Now, was that before or after you stole the cream from your mother ?
Look, you want to shave your head and ruin your life, that's fine, but when you hurt other people, that's when I have a problem.
Look, I came to you for help, gonna turn into a father/son lecture, then...
Let's stop pretending we have a father/son relationship, shall we?
I'm billing you for my time.
Matt!
Hey...
Ariel.
What... what's going on here?
Dad, what are you doing here?
Well, Matt called me.
What happened to your face?
She had a reaction to a skin-bleaching cream.
Nothing severe.
She's gonna be fine.
Why did you call him?
Because you can't keep hiding this anymore, Ariel.
Hiding what?
What...
How did this happen?
Matt said that I should lighten my freckles, so he stole some bleach cream from his mom's spa, and we put it on my face and I had a reaction.
You did this?
Tell him you told me about the research paper.
Honey, I won't let him hurt you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ariel discovered that her mother, your wife, comes from African lineage but she was so afraid of what you might do that she tried to bleach her skin!
- What?
- Just tell her that being 1/16 black doesn't matter to you.
That your love for her is not based on what color she is.
Is that true?
Of course not.
Dad, I'm not black.
He's just saying this to you because he doesn't want to get in trouble.
- You are a sick person...
- You don't think that I'd ever hurt you, do you, sweetheart ?
Well, I welcome you into our home, and this is how you repay me, by making up these hateful lies?
Mr. Alderman, she'll do something worse next time.
No, my daughter is one of the most confident, strong women that I have ever known, and you couldn't handle that, could you?
So you tried to change her face so that you feel better about yourself.
You know, there's not definitively what he does.
My son saved your daughter from a severe burn.
Now, you can believe your own bullshit if you want to, that's fine.
But unless you want a problem with me,
I suggest you leave now.
As long as your son stays away from my daughter, we have no problem.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because people only believe what they want to.
So, looks like my advice fell on deaf ears.
Oh, I heard you, doctor.
It's just that I hadn't met Circe yet.
Well, that's not quite true.
Joy used to catch us flirting all the time.
Circe work on the Cinnabun near the North Pole.
Well, she's not going to catch you here if that's what you were hoping.
Your wife checked out this morning.
- She did?
- Yes.
Well, so what?
She'll... she'll hear about it, one way or another.
I work with Santa now.
And you work quickly...
Look, doc, all year long it's, uh...
"Gimme an x-box.
Gimme a spongebob."
I spend my life fulfilling other people's wishes.
I'm sure you know something about that.
This year, Santa got himself a present.
Circe here has a fantastic, wonderful Christmas spirit, and I like a rewarder with some double ds.
Come on, doc.
What better way to promote Santa's new image than by showing off his healthy young woman?
Matty.
What are you doing here?
I didn't...
I didn't think you'd be home on Christmas Eve.
Uh, I was just leaving that for you.
It's an I.O.U. 30 hours slave labor... car washes, coffee runs, whatever you need to pay off Ariel's visit.
I'm not exactly liquid right now.
- Merry Christmas.
- You're hungry ?
I just bought a ton of food.
Not a bad way to spend the holidays.
Two single men watching football, eating Chinese, it's America.
How are you doing by the way ?
I don't think about her.
I was proud of what you did earlier.
Standing up to that asshole took guts.
It's not gonna change anything, man.
They'll go on living in lie and no one ever talk about it.
You ever wish you didn't know about me ?
Being your biological father ?
Yeah.
It were certainly easier not knowing.
But, uh...
I'm adjusting.
You?
I'm adjusting, too.
I'm Julia McNamara.
I have a 7:30 appointment.
Just fill this out, Mrs. McNamara.
Rain started yet?
Not yet.
Any minute, though.
Thank you.
Please have a sit, the doctor will be out in a few minutes.
I was thinking... there are the first Christmas Eve alone without the kids in 18 years.
Yes.
Just thinking the same thing.
It' your baby, Sean.
I know.
Mrs. McNamara?
The doctor's ready for you now.
I don't want to do this.
Me neither.
Let's get out of here.

Screenplay:

Directed by Shmuel Hasfari, Amir Hasfari
You could start this story 50 years ago, when my grandfather Yekutiel Schwartz and Grandma Miriam founded Bnei Avraham, a small green town full of henhouses and surrounded by fields.
Most of its residents were immigrants from Yemen.
You could also start this story one year ago, when my grandfather committed suicide, a week before Yom Kippur.
He was head of the council and was accused of embezzlement.
He was questioned by the police and had his picture in the paper.
Grandpa Yekutiel was so hurt, he jumped off the water tower.
Grandma hardly stepped foot out of the house since.
She sat and planned how she'd clear Grandpa's name at his one-year memorial service in the presence of all Bnei Avraham residents.
She brought Pinhas Goidar, the present head of council, and told him exactly what to say tomorrow at the memorial service.
Here, outside the council building that you headed, we say to you:
You fulfilled your calling, Yekutiel.
May you rest in peace, and speak up.
- And speak...
What?
Speak up.
And point when you're talking.
Point?
At who?
When you mention the synagogue, point at the synagogue.
When you mention the council building, point at it, so people will see.
- Okay, I'll try.
Don't try, do it.
Then invite everyone over to my house.
I'll take care of the refreshments.
Wait...
Maybe Avraham should speak.
He's the son.
It's customary for the son to...
- You, you are the head of council, it's important that it comes from your mouth, Pinhas.
You can't rely on Avraham, as you know.
Pinhas knows that you can't rely on Avraham.
When they were kids, my dad hung him on a tree by his feet and left him dangling there till morning.
Bomba, the army is evacuating us with force.
Then stay put with even more force.
Do you have enough chains?
Over.
Yes, but there's nothing to tie them to.
Avraham, nicknamed Bomba,:
Is my father.
He lives in a West Bank settlement and is the reason I left home and moved near Grandma in Bnei Avraham, you'll see...
Chain yourselves together and start singing "No fear".
My father loves the Land of Israel, loves cussing, but what he loves the most is running other people's lives.
And that's me.
Avishai Schwartz.
A cantor and bar-mitzvah teacher.
"And rightfulness..." Good, keep going.
Tomer, I don't hear you.
Rabbi Avishai, what are you doing?
The tobacco spilled out, I'm putting it back in the cigarette.
And I'm not a rabbi.
Who said you could come in here anyway?
Get out, sit down.
To this day, I've never had love.
Keep going, Tomer.
Never mind.
Back to my father, who took upon himself to put up notices all over town for Grandpa's memorial service.
Come over here, kid.
Me?
- You with the crappy bicycle, come over here.
If my father wasn't a settler, he'd probably be a gangster.
Listen kid, I have an important assignment for you.
Not interested.
It's not an assignment, it's a mitzvah.
A mivtzvah?
Why not.
No one understands how my regal grandmother and my grandfather, the great educator wound up with a son like my father.
When he left to become a settler 20 years ago, the whole town sighed.
With relief.
But now he's back.
Well?
What's wrong with it?
- Nothing's wrong with it.
Tomorrow morning, ultra-orthodox kids will put them up all over town.
You'd think ultra-orthodox kids would do it as a mitzvah?
No fucking way!
I had to pay them...
I'm sorry, Mom.
I'm sorry.
Shame on you.
It just came out, I said I'm sorry.
You come two weeks late with these notices and expect to be applauded?
Thank you, Avraham, we managed without you.
I see, I'm going to Avishai's.
In your dreams.
The whole town is coming here tomorrow after the service.
Start setting the tables and arranging the chairs.
And don't touch the food, it's all counted.
"Bnei Avraham Synagogue"
This is Zaki.
And this is what he likes doing in the morning.
That was the window of his aunt
Ziona's new non-kosher butcher shop.
What are you looking at?
Start cleaning up!
Keep going, kid!
Three more to go!
A strong nation doesn't break!
Go on, kid!
Ziona married Dr. Alex Alexandrov, a breast cancer surgeon who emigrated from Russia and became a butcher, thanks to her.
Another one ran off.
- Others will come.
We don't need all these showy refrigerators.
What was wrong with the store before?
It was small and quiet.
Small shop, small money.
- I work like a horse.
Selling things I'm ashamed of, God have mercy.
I don't know most of our customers.
They speak a language I don't understand.
You'd already become Israeli, now you're speaking Russian again.
I don't want this.
Ziona honey...
I sell what people like.
Not everything's chicken.
We Russians eat other things too.
If someone likes Yemenite food, do I go and break his window?
Eat Yemenite food, what do I care?
Don't get upset, meat is meat.
And this is Anna.
The heroine of my story.
Good morning.
Just look at her.
Someone broke your window.
They delivered fresh rolls, if you want some breakfast.
Go get circumcised.
She told me... to get circumcised.
- When is she leaving?
Not again!
What do you want me to do?
Throw her out onto the street?
She's my brother's daughter.
She's family.
Grandpa's big memorial service was supposed to start at noon, but they only finished putting up the notices at 11:30.
The smell of a major fuck-up filled the air but my father still found the time to chew me out.
When was the last time I was here?
- About two months ago.
When Mom kicked you out.
Why?
Because that's when I put this rubber band around your tefillin.
You haven't put it on since.
I get up too late, Dad.
- Then get up at seven, damn it!
Grandpa's service is in half an hour and you're still sleeping?
Look at yourself!
You're not married, you don't work or study.
I work!
I'm teaching four kids for their bar-mitzvah, so don't say I don't work.
- Is that so?
The Jewish people needs tigers, lions, eagles.
What did I end up with?
Joselito...
A canary!
Avishai, could you be gay?
What?
- A faggot.
A fag.
Aside from raiding my fridge, my father had other plans.
Avishai, I'm running for parliament for the National Religious Party.
Why?
They need a hawk, a real settler to reinforce them.
- So?
What's stopping you?
- I need votes, Avishai.
And the votes are here in the heartland, not in the armpit of the settlements.
So I thought I'd start here, where I was born and raised.
Count me out.
I know you and there's no way I'm voting for you.
And don't eat up all my salami.
And my pickles!
C'mon, Dad!
You'll vote like I tell you to, now move your ass, we're late.
At Grandma's house, everything was ready for those who'd come after Grandpa's service to apologize to the deceased and his widow.
Grandpa's voice wafted from the tape recorder, he was the town's cantor.
"Memorial service:
Yekutiel Schwartz"
I said to deliver the pigs at night, not in broad daylight.
What do you want me to do now?
Tell her to put something on, she's half naked again.
Move.
That'll be 220.
200?
220.
Thank you.
Here's 220 for you and 20 for you.
Hi.
How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
This is all you're buying?
I'm a vegetarian.
Then go to a green grocer.
I won't open up the register for this.
See you on Monday.
Do you know him?
- No.
Then what's "See you on Monday"?
I don't know.
Maybe from one of my jobs.
- One of your jobs...
Anna came to Israel for one week to bring her father to burial.
She didn't know she needed a Rabbinate permission or how much it would cost.
So for months she's been taking any job she can get.
You're so smug, with that little ass of yours.
Beauty doesn't last forever, baby.
It was already 12 o'clock.
But the crowds were nowhere to be seen.
This is it, Avraham?
Calm down, we'll wait a few more minutes.
Here comes Pinhas!
See?
I told you not to worry.
May the Lord give you comfort and consolation.
We're here to make up the holy quorum.
Thank you, but that won't be necessary.
Lots of people are coming.
The head of council told us to come, so we came.
The head of council isn't coming?
Avraham, why isn't he coming?
"O Merciful God in heaven
"Grant proper rest
"on the wings of the Divine Presence..."
I should be so lucky.
Look at the privacy this guy has.
- Privacy?
You idiot.
He was buried outside the fence, like a dog.
It was obvious that the gathering Grandma had planned in front of the council building wouldn't come through.
She wouldn't even let us drive her home.
She went alone to plan her next move.
Get back to work.
My clothes.
My money.
In my pocket.
Here.
Anna, please respect this house.
What house?
Your witch of a wife stuck me in this storage room.
Okay, okay, it's none of my business.
I'm going home anyway.
I have a hearing tomorrow at the Rabbinate.
- Again?
God have mercy.
- That's what I came for.
They explained to you that it's impossible!
The laws here are different!
Just forget about it, it's been a year now!
- Shut up!
- What?
Shut up.
You could solve my problem in five minutes, but you don't want to.
Yes I do.
But I can't.
Fine.
Never mind.
I found someone.
He's religious and is familiar with all the laws here.
He'll help me.
I don't need any more favors from you.
How much is it going to cost?
- All of my money.
I'll have enough to buy a plane ticket.
So long, bye-bye.
Anna, you're making a mistake.
Why go back to Russia?
This is a normal country, a good country, believe me.
Find a job, get married.
You already speak good Hebrew.
Why go back?
Sometimes one man can bring disaster on everyone.
Sometimes one man does a deed and saves everyone.
Like our little Zaki who fights daily against the pigs.
His good deed will assist us on Judgment Day.
God bless Zaki!
Yom Kippur is approaching.
Penitential prayers are at 5:30.
Whoever wants to earn another mitzvah should go to the empty Ashkenazi synagogue.
May we all be inscribed in the Book of Life.
Kids, go home to your mother.
I'll join you later.
This is the man that will decide about Anna's matter.
Rabbi Eliyahu Hason.
The head rabbinical judge in Bnei Avraham.
I was still sleeping the morning after the memorial but things were happening fast.
Grandma had a new idea on how to clear grandpa's name.
You've got nothing to worry about.
You can ask about me.
I've never lost a case in my life.
On the other hand a Russian...
That's a problem.
I don't mean to offend you, but we charge Russians 2000, upfront.
So before we get started, do you have 2000 shekels?
I have 1500.
In cash?
Only for you, Svetlana.
Anna.
- Anna.
I hope you're not offended.
Sometimes people ask for help, and then they don't pay.
This matter requires stamps, duplicates, translations, forms, authorizations, phone calls...
Once I went all the way to Bukhara to permit a woman to remarry.
Not now, not now.
Great.
I'm...
I'm so sorry, Miriam.
There was an unscheduled meeting at the Ministry.
I told them everything, that it's my predecessor, that his widow is a dear friend.
I begged them, but it didn't do any good.
A decree from Above.
- Yes.
Come, let's sit in my office.
Ronit, pick up the phone.
I know you're at home.
Ronit, answer me.
Did you get the groceries?
I want to see you.
Pinhas...
- Not now.
Just a minute, Pinhas.
- What's going on?
Let's sit outside.
Okay, okay.
They're taking over the council.
They do as they please with the budgets, they brought in new rabbinical judges.
God have mercy, Miriam, they're all repentant Jews.
I'm like a dinosaur to them.
An alien.
Nevertheless...
you're head of council.
There are still things that only you can do.
What do you mean?
Do you need something?
Just one thing.
Anna Alexandrov.
A request was submitted to the Rabbinate in Ashkelon, denied.
A request was submitted to the Rabbinate in Petah Tikva, denied.
In Be'er Sheva, denied.
In Ashdod, denied.
Miss Russia, are you developing a network?
She's not the issue here.
The permission is for the father.
Where's the father?
He's here, but he's not with us.
So is he here or not?
Both.
It's hard to explain.
Okay, take it out.
He's in there?
The father is in there?
Yes, your honors, the lady would like to give him a Jewish burial, that's all.
I don't know what to say.
I've never heard such a request.
Pinhas, a woman must rest beside her husband.
- But...
We were together our whole life.
I want a burial plot beside my husband.
I'm willing to pay any price.
It's not a matter of money, Miriam.
Yekutiel was buried outside the fence because that's Jewish law, that's where people who committed suicide are buried.
No one is buried there willingly, it's a dishonor, a stain, why would you want that?
Precisely because of that.
Who will remove the stain if not his wife?
I owe it to him.
And so do you.
Not now!
Not now!
Leave me alone!
Are you crazy?
You want your money back?
Why should I give it to you?
- But you didn't do anything.
Lady, if you went to the doctor and the medicine didn't work, would you ask for your money back?
Never!
You think here it's different?
Give me my money back!
- Let go of my bag!
I didn't touch her, she just fell.
You're a witness!
Grandma!
Grandma, the Russian girl woke up!
Grandma!
Stop yelling.
I'm from Russia too.
Why are you hitting me?
I'm just trying to help.
Go to the kitchen and get a bowl of soup from the pot.
Help and get hit.
I've had it, Grandma.
How are you feeling?
Can you speak Hebrew?
A little.
Where do you live?
Don't worry, your handbag is here.
I have to go.
- No, wait.
First have some soup, then a shower.
Then we'll see.
Maybe she was arrested.
Is that why you didn't come?
She didn't come back, there may be a problem.
There is a problem.
My husband is an idiot.
I'm going to see where she is.
If you go, don't bother coming back, you hear?
It's none of your business.
- None of my business?
The whole town is talking about me behind my back.
Let them talk.
She's my family.
I don't say anything about your family.
Well thank you, you ungrateful bastard.
My family gave us the money to start the business.
Business...
Business for their defective chickens, instead of throwing them away, we sell them.
I'm gonna break someone's head open!
Alex!
What did you do?
!
You can't do that!
Alex!
Leave him alone!
Shut up!
Why do you keep doing this?
!
You've broken my window three times!
Three times!
Get out of here, you dogs!
Alex, Alex.
You're bleeding.
I won't stand for this.
Dad, you haven't stopped making demands since you got here.
You're staying at my place, behave like a guest.
Avishai, you're mine, your place is mine, everything you have is mine.
What is this?
You like it?
No.
- Too bad.
Because as of tomorrow, you'll be distributing them around town.
Why me?
- Then who, me?
I lug them, unpack them, distribute them, what'll do you do?
Get elected.
Now go out and get the other boxes, then go to bed, you have a lot of work tomorrow, and we're going to Grandma's to talk to her about a very important matter.
- About what?
It's a surprise.
Wait till tomorrow.
"Have compassion on Your handiwork
"And be glad with Your handiwork
"May those who take refuge in You say
"when You vindicate those borne by You..."
He sings like a nightingale.
What a voice.
It's as if Dad were standing here, singing.
People pay to hear him.
Tell her where you did the Passover Seder.
At Club Med in Marmaris.
They paid him to do the Seder for all the Israelis.
I've already heard that 100 times.
- Good.
When Pinhas comes, that's what you'll tell him.
That in memory of his late grandfather,
Avishai should be the cantor at the synagogue on Yom Kippur.
It's not like it's the National Auditorium.
Yeah, everyone's old and gone deaf.
But the old folks remember what it used to be like before this town was flooded with those damn Yemenites.
When a knitted skullcap was respected.
I want them to cry.
Why do you want them to cry?
I just do, okay?
It's because he wants to run for Parliament.
- What?
Why not?
They need people like me.
Who needs people like you?
Just ask Pinhas to let Avishai be the cantor on Yom Kippur.
If Avishai is the cantor, you'll be elected to Parliament?
Oh, he has a plan.
All the old timers will sit together, hear the grandson pray like the grandfather, they'll remember the good ol' days, and elect Dad to represent them in Parliament.
Look.
It was a stupid plan, but my father believed in it with all his heart.
I see.
He'll sing a little and they'll run to vote for you.
No.
First I'll give a sermon that'll make the walls shake.
They won't let you.
- They will if you ask.
There he is.
If Pinhas knew that my Dad was waiting for him there, he'd never enter the mousetrap.
When they were kids, my father hung him...
I told you this story already.
Hello, Schwartzs.
Go ahead, ask him yourselves.
Ask me what?
Pinhas sweetheart, I wanted to ask you something.
Those pants you're wearing, have you been wearing the same ones for the past 20 years or did you buy two pairs and keep alternating?
Avraham, don't start up with me.
Everyone here...
We really missed you.
I told you.
Truce.
Don't hop.
Apologize.
- I apologize.
For what?
Maybe for not showing up at my father's memorial service?
I had to attend...
- You had what?
A service for the late head of the council and the new one doesn't show up?
Stand up straight.
Stop squirming.
Do you already have a cantor for Yom Kippur?
- Yes.
The youth group leader.
- You don't say.
What else do you have in store for us?
A campfire?
Folk dancing?
Scary storytelling?
- Miriam, why did he say "us"?
Who's "us"?
He wants Avishai to be the cantor on Yom Kippur.
Aren't you going to Marmaris?
- Yeah.
I mean...
Changed his mind at the last minute.
Yes, but I already told...
and we can't pay much.
You don't have to pay him.
How do you like that?
As long as the grandson carries on where the grandfather left off.
Why are you standing?
Sit, sit.
Well?
- Well?
A sermon for the son...
A sermon for the son?
- What son?
How many sons do I have?
Him?
Come with me.
- What now?
You have to practice, so you don't put me to shame.
Move it.
Look at this.
Do you have an answer for me?
- That's why I came.
I'm dealing with it, but you're making it hard on me.
What's the story with the Russian girl?
What Russian girl?
She passed out and I helped her.
That's not good.
People told me that you brought her here.
They saw you.
- What's not good?
She's a fraud, who put some ashes in an urn and asked the rabbinical judges for permission to bury it.
She's not even Jewish and has no right to be here.
It's not good for your request, Miriam, that they'll think you have a connection to doubtful people.
What you're asking for is a very delicate matter.
Very uncommon.
I didn't think it was wrong.
I thought...
Then I'm telling you that it's wrong.
As long as you're involved with her, I can't grant your request, despite my good will.
- Okay, Pinhas.
I heard you.
I'm impressed.
Well?
Well what?
Do you have a name?
- Anna.
- Anna...
"Ve'ani anna ani ba." Genesis 37.
Write it down.
Oh my God.
Pleased to meet you.
Avraham.
Mother.
Son.
Freeloader.
Why are you talking with a Russian accent?
She's Russian, Mom, how else will she understand?
Ignore him.
Come, I need to talk to you.
Want some?
Listen.
I'm through with the non-kosher meat, the pigs, the broken windows, the fines, the debts, your Russian friends, and the fights with my family.
If that's not fine by you, I'm through with you too.
Now decide.
It's either me and everything kosher, or your slutty niece and the pigs.
What's she got to do with the broken window?
- Everything!
I want you to send her away.
- She's already left on her own.
I've been hearing the same story for the past year.
I've had it.
You really want to help her go back to Russia?
Yes.
Here.
Give her this.
What is it?
Eliyahu.
The head rabbinical judge.
I didn't want to do it, but...
See that address?
He's going there to meet a woman.
How do you know?
People saw him.
He lives there, but hangs out there.
What does that mean?
If you really want to help her, give her the note.
She should catch him red-handed, threaten him, yell at him, bring this matter to an end and get the hell out of here with all the pigs you brought in here.
Take those away.
- But why, Ronit?
Because, I don't need any favors from you.
Why do you come here?
I came to see how you're doing.
It's none of your business anymore.
Stop calling, stop coming.
But I worry about you.
Eli, you already had the chance to worry about me and you missed it.
So just forget about me.
Take them away.
Take them.
Tell me how the tests went.
- None of your business.
When's the operation?
- There's a mile-Iong waiting list.
There is no operation.
- Maybe I can do something to help.
What a man.
More important people tried, but couldn't do anything.
Goodbye.
Regards to your wife.
If you admit you're still crazy about me,
I'll take the groceries.
Tell them about your father, about his dream to immigrate to Israel and not being able to fulfill it.
They are decent people, that's why they're there.
Did you tell them that it was his last wish to be buried here?
Yes, but they threw me out.
One of them said that because my mother isn't Jewish,
I'm not Jewish either.
But did you tell them that you don't want anything?
No money, no aid.
Just to bury the ashes and go home?
They make fun of me, because I'm from Russia.
It doesn't make sense.
Pick that one, on that branch down there.
Can you reach it?
Tell me...
- What now?
Would you do her?
C'mon, Dad.
Avishai, I'm your father.
Everything you think about, I've already thought about before.
Look, Anna, I've heard you and I believe you.
I'm going to talk to the judges.
They'll treat me differently.
And that girl who you belittle leaves everything, comes to a foreign land, stays here for months, like a dog, to fulfill her father's last wish to be buried in a Jewish cemetery in Israel.
- That's what she says!
That's exactly what she says.
Why don't you believe her?
How do you know what those ashes are in that urn?
It could be a cat.
Or a gentile.
How do you know she'll want to go back to Russia afterwards?
She may fall in love with us and want to stay.
Someone has to be the bad guy and ask these unpleasant questions.
Even at country clubs they don't admit just anybody.
All the more so at a holy cemetery.
We need proof, and if there's no proof, there's no permission.
Okay, she got the picture.
Now step outside with me.
What about cases that can't be proven?
But this case can be proven.
- The witness can prove it.
Witness?
There's a witness?
What witness?
What if she doesn't convince them?
- Get real.
My family founded this place.
Of course she'll convince them.
Who are all these people?
Those who lived until the Holocaust.
Those who were killed in the Holocaust.
The one with the medal is my late grandfather.
And the one with the mustache is my father.
They all have mustaches.
Oh yeah.
30 years ago they went to build settlements in the West Bank.
Right where the Arabs lived.
Ever heard of settlers?
Never mind.
That's where I was born.
Here.
Where did you get this?
Grandma grows it for me in the garden.
Your grandma is a good woman.
Yeah.
But she doesn't know.
She waters it, it grows, I smoke.
That's me.
- Cute.
Just an ordinary kid.
What's wrong with that?
With a dynasty like this, I should've turned out a genius.
But I'm not.
So what do you do?
You smoke, that's what you do.
Come here.
I'll teach you something.
What was that?
Paravozik.
- Para what?
How do you say in Hebrew the engine of a train?
Locomotive?
- Locomotive, but little.
I can't breathe.
Can we do it again?
Grandma, it's not what you think.
I was telling her about our dynasty.
About all the rabbis, the mustaches, in the Holocaust.
Especially about Grandpa.
Avishai, go home.
- But I'm...
I need to have a word with Anna.
But...
- Now!
I tried to help you and you deceived me.
You're wrong, Miriam.
You're wrong.
They told me you're a fraud!
And I didn't believe them.
You think I'm easily deceived?
Why should I deceive?
It's just a burial permission.
What's the problem, Miriam?
It's only ashes.
Who knows that he's Jewish?
How can they bury him in a Jewish cemetery?
There are rules!
And now all of a sudden, there's a witness.
Who is he?
- My father's brother.
What?
- But he won't testify, he has problems with the religious council.
What's his name?
What's his name?
- Alex.
Alex what?
Where is he?
Here, in town.
He has a butcher shop.
- A butcher shop?
The non-kosher one that belongs to the Russian?
Yes, it's his.
But he gave me a job and a place to sleep, just because he's my father's brother, but he won't testify.
I tried everything, he won't do it.
Do you want me to leave?
What happened?
Why is she angry?
It's none of your business.
Let me go.
- Go where?
I have work to do.
- What work?
Let me at least walk you.
Not yet, don't look yet.
Just a minute.
Dad's election campaign started gaining momentum.
He got off my back and started abusing the old people.
Dear founders.
Remember the days when our synagogue was filled with knitted-skullcap wearing congregants every Sabbath?
Good.
Now please turn around.
Open your eyes.
Woe to the eyes that see this.
See what?
That there's nothing to see.
The Ashkenazi synagogue is forsaken and empty.
And?
- And, it's our duty to fill it.
Okay, okay.
Let's go home, Tzivia.
Let's go.
- Wait, where are you going?
Avraham, you don't even have the key.
How do you expect to fill it?
With a little faith, Mrs. Pomerantz.
With a little faith, we'll fill the synagogue by Yom Kippur.
Men, women and children.
Bomba's promise.
Bomba's promise.
I'm glad you agree with me.
Good, good.
Lift your head a little.
Bend your left arm and stretch out your left leg.
That's it.
Very good.
Good.
Bye.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
What are you doing here?
- I saw everything.
You're a whore!
Why are you doing this?
Because I need money.
And I don't have a grandmother and father to help me.
I'm all alone.
I'm sorry.
Anna.
Where have you been?
How did it go?
It didn't.
And the money?
Gone.
So, it means you stay with us?
I don't know what to do.
I have nothing here and I can't leave until I finish this.
Here.
What is it?
I'll explain it to you...
Take.
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten steps.
There you go.
Ten steps divided by two is five meters.
It's very close.
Near the pathway too.
There's easy access and a water faucet.
Even half a meter.
I asked to be buried beside him.
I checked it out, Miriam.
According to Jewish law, that's as close as you can get.
The law is very specific.
But I want to be next to him out of my own free will.
What's wrong with that?
- Your will isn't enough.
I may have been able to arrange something under the table, but you went and ruined everything with that Russian girl.
The whole religious council is talking about you.
They don't understand what you're doing with her.
You promised.
I promised to check it out and I did.
You can't get any closer.
I'm doing everything I can.
I arranged for your grandson to be the cantor on Yom Kippur, your son is permitted to give a sermon afterwards.
It wasn't easy...
So it's fine by you that this man who raised you, who made you his assistant, who bequeathed his job to you, that this man will lie here alone in disgrace and everyone who enters the cemetery will say:
Here lies the crook who committed suicide.
Will it change anything if you lie here too?
Yes.
Mr. Sharabi?
May I have a minute of your time?
What do you want?
Do you take the art class at the community center?
- Yes.
My name is Avishai.
I've heard about your class.
It's awesome.
- Yes.
Look, I'm an avid art lover, but personally
I'm not interested in Picasso, Van Gogh, Mozart, or Salvadori.
Who's Salvadori?
- Never mind.
I'm more into paintings by the common people.
I'm interested in purchasing one of your paintings.
Seriously?
- Yeah.
The one you did this week.
I'll pay you 50 shekels for it.
Get out of here, you psycho.
- 100 shekels?
You know what?
Wait here.
I already had 19 paintings in my bag.
Sharabi was the last one on the list.
Here.
"Let all our vows
"and oaths and the obligations
"we incur to You, O God..."
Why are you bending down over there?
Want some soup?
Want some gefilte fish?
Want to fight with me?
What do you want?
For you to let me listen to the tapes at my place.
They don't leave this house.
They're the memories I have from your grandfather.
If you want to practice, practice here.
You're a real angel.
I didn't throw her out.
She left on her own.
Fine.
Yura, stop eating and start playing!
That's what you're here for...
See how they took our song and translated it into Arabic?
Anna.
Why are you sitting in here?
Come outside.
We're having a barbecue.
You have to be a little happy.
How much happiness do we get?
Get out of here!
Fima, where are you?
I'm coming...
- It's an Israeli song, did you translate it into Russian?
Well?
Ladies and gentlemen, we will sing and we will dance, but now for the official part.
Come on, speak up.
- Friends,
I have a special announcement:
As of tomorrow, anyone who wants decent food, can go to hell.
Today is your last chance.
So eat up and whatever's left over, take home.
Because as of tomorrow, I'll be selling only kosher meat.
Some parasite inspector will come, hang a certificate on the wall, take his money, and that's it.
But don't worry, from the back door, we'll keep selling defective chickens from Ziona's distinguished family.
Alex.
- Okay, it's a family secret.
In any case, life goes on.
To life!
To the chickens!
You're driving me crazy with all your mitzvahs.
Reading Psalms, changing the mezuzahs every other day.
What do I need your mitzvahs for?
When I really wanted you, you got up and left.
What other choice did you leave me?
You made fun of me.
You purposely smoked in front of me on the Sabbath.
Go away, Eliyahu.
I'm not made of stone.
When I see you on the street with your children, it makes my stomach turn.
Leave me alone.
I'm begging you.
I can't, you're my flesh and blood.
That you dumped, and then went to another woman.
Ronit, I swear to you...
If you promise to observe the Sabbath and keep kosher,
I'll come back to you.
Then kiss me.
Kiss me.
What are you doing here?
This isn't your house.
And you're judging me?
You're a rabbi.
Shame on you.
You pretend to be religious and come here to be with her.
Excuse me, who are you?
I'm going to tell the Rabbinate what you're doing here.
So you came here to blackmail me, eh?
How did you know I was here?
- Everybody knows.
He's religious and comes here.
What does he have here?
A girl!
He's religious and you're not.
There!
Eliyahu, what does this lady want from you?
This lady is trying to blackmail me to get her own way!
This lady brought an urn and said that her father's ashes are in it and that we'd better believe her.
Not only that, she sent the widow of the late head of council, the one who...
Schwartz.
So you're here to blackmail me, darling?
Change your decision or I'll tell them about your whore!
Shut your dirty mouth or I'll kick you out!
Chill out.
- But did you hear what she said?
Listen, sweetie.
I'm not a whore, I'm his ex-wife.
We used to be married.
Great, why don't you offer her a cup of coffee?
Here. 500 dollars.
- What?
Take it, I'll bring you more later, just change your decision!
Get your hands off me!
But it's my father!
Eliyahu...
I'm calling the police.
Wait a second...
Go after her.
Go after her.
Looking for mitzvahs?
A little one just ran off on you.
Go.
Go talk to her.
Call Mrs. Schwartz to come get her.
My father was Jewish and I don't know what to do to make you believe me.
It was his last wish.
That may be true, but my hands are tied.
I want to help, but...
If you need help with anything else, like learning Hebrew or converting, I can work something out.
But there's the Shulchan Aruch when it comes to this matter.
Shulchan Aruch?
The Jewish code of laws.
You need a witness, a certificate.
There are no two ways about it.
I hope you can understand me.
There are no two ways about it.
I still don't know what touched Grandma more:
Anna's sorrow or my sorrow.
Go to your uncle, tell him I want to meet him.
He won't agree.
So tell him I want to give you work.
But before that
I want to meet the family.
Okay?
Where did you study medicine?
At the military academy in St. Pittsburgh.
St. Petersburg.
The Kirov Academy?
How do you know?
We have his diploma at home and the license he got in Israel.
We should've brought them.
But I heard they didn't accept Jews there.
Jews, non-Jews, what does it matter now?
The main thing is that we're all here now, we have a strong state and army.
And your brother, Yuri, he didn't serve in the army?
Dad paid so he wouldn't have to go.
When it was my turn, there was no money, so I went.
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that I made it to Israel.
And then he met me.
Tell her, Alex.
Yes, I met you, like a diamond in the earth's ass, as they say.
In a hen house.
She was waiting for me.
Especially for me.
- It was my pleasure, darling.
Thank you.
- Sacha...
Would you like some more borsht?
Yes.
Miriam, your borsht is delicious.
- Thank you.
Yummy.
It's okay, Avishai will get it.
What am I, a waitress?
So you never saw your brother again after you left?
- No.
I met Anna for the first time here in Israel.
You know... family, you do what you can.
Avishai, why don't you sing something for us?
Sing something special for your grandmother.
It may have been the pressure that made my voice come out so high.
"She opens her mouth with wisdom
"And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue
"She watches over the ways of her household
"And does not eat the bread of idleness
"Her children rise up and call her blessed
"Her husband also, and he praises her..."
That's it, we're leaving.
Yafim.
Yafim, sit down.
Alex, what's with you?
She wants me to testify.
You heard the questions she was asking me.
These are good people.
- Oh yeah?
Then why was she asking if Jews were accepted there?
What does it matter now?
- So she asked.
Answer her, finish eating, say goodbye and she'll take Anna.
Or do you not want to give her up now?
Look at this wall.
There's a whole Rabbinate here.
This one got a medal.
Don't you guys mind that I'm here?
- What?
I can hear every word you're saying.
Don't you care?
What do you want?
Doesn't my presence make any difference to you?
I could be a spy from the Rabbinate.
Are you?
- No, but how would you know?
Didn't you say you're a cantor?
- Yeah?
So?
Then keep singing.
Fima, stop gobbling...
Yafim!
They're gone.
What did you say?
I'm an atheist.
I won't go near the Rabbinate.
Why not?
It's a matter of principle.
I'm a rational person.
My brother is dead.
It's over.
They're ashes.
Go scatter them at sea, what does it matter?
Don't give me that nonsense.
Go, testify, and then keep being a man of principle all you like.
Is tomorrow morning good for you?
- Come here.
I want to let you in on something.
He wasn't circumcised.
One brother had it done and the other didn't?
No.
The other brother didn't have it done either.
When he went to testify for her and they heard about the butcher shop, they told him to pull his pants down and prove that he's Jewish.
Then he should get circumcised.
Your mother should get circumcised!
Great, she learned a new word.
Circumcised, circumcised.
You're a gentile, and you're telling him to get circumcised?
- Why not?
Because I'm not gonna wait to have sex for 6 months until it heals.
And what if something happens to it?
Will you fix it?
I won't take the risk.
But it's for her father.
His brother.
It could be his grandmother, for all I care.
If my brothers find out he's uncircumcised, we'll be divorced tomorrow morning.
They give me a hard time as it is for bringing home a Russian.
What do you mean?
I found you in a hen house.
34 years old.
In chicken shit.
I'm a surgeon, they treat me like dirt.
But if Anna means a lot to you...
- I mean more to him.
What about her?
I can't.
Period.
You don't want to.
I'm sorry.
It's my life against hers.
Let's go.
She's pretty, that's true.
But you'll find yourself a nice girl, one who doesn't have to convert.
- Yeah, right.
Don't smoke here.
- Great.
Nice.
Finally some girl notices that I exist...
Hallelujah, you're getting laid.
Avraham...
Who noticed that you exist?
Grandma, control your son.
Avraham, watch your mouth, you're not in Parliament yet.
Just a matter of time, because tonight the Lord himself is setting me up for a goal.
I keep explaining to people that things here are going downhill and no one knows what I'm talking about.
- Neither do I.
Don't you smell anything?
The whole town is full of smoke.
The black suits are burning down the Russians' butcher shop.
What?
The smell of an extra large barbecue.
Extra-extra large.
It's all up in flames, including the meat.
Yafim, call the firemen!
We've already did ten times, they're not coming!
It's all because of her!
My urn is in there!
Get more water!
My urn is in there!
Whore...
What happened?
Who did this?
Where are you going?
The urn is in there.
You can't go in there, it's all burning!
Stand here, don't move!
Is there any hot water?
I want to take a shower.
A shower...
This is where I live.
This is the kitchen.
This is where I sleep.
Did you get hurt?
No.
Let me see.
What?
Everything's okay.
The shower is all yours.
Good morning.
Open for business?
The war on Dr. Alexander was not over.
And this time grandma dropped an unconventional bomb.
Good job.
You sold pork, did you think people would turn a blind eye?
Are you Alex?
What do you want from him?
To start behaving like a human being, damn it!
We have enough trouble without you.
I'm here to help you.
How can you help?
Stage one.
In two days, your husband reports at the council.
He looks the rabbis in the eyes and says determinedly that you're Jewish, your brother is Jewish, your father is Jewish, your grandpa and grandma, you're all Jewish, a family of rabbis, then they'll cut the bullshit.
Go fuck yourself.
You're a doctor, aren't you?
- How do you know?
Shut up.
Two phone calls to the right people and I can get Dr. Surgeon a job at the hospital by tomorrow morning.
- As a doctor?
A pathologist.
- A pathologist?
Why not?
It's like a doctor, but the patients can't complain.
Bomba's promise.
And our debts?
Stage two.
You and your Russian friends come to our synagogue on Yom Kippur.
Russians at synagogue.
You've got to be kidding.
Fine.
But when they take away everything you have and kick your asses out of this town, don't come running to me.
By the way, I'm Avraham Schwartz.
Call me Bomba.
Nice meeting you.
- Are you from the Rabbinate?
On the contrary, ma'am.
I'm from the Religious Front for the Liberation of Bnei Avraham.
This is my platform.
The minute he left, my dad arranged everything with one phone call.
The guy is an expert surgeon, don't bury him in pathology.
Speaking of surgery, I need one more favor...
People are waiting outside, your honor.
Ask them to wait patiently.
Miriam...
I apologize.
Something must've happened.
It's Yom Kippur eve.
He's a doctor.
Perhaps he's been held up by patients.
This joke has gone too far.
Let's move on to the next hearing.
Absolutely not.
He didn't show up.
What do you want them to do?
Wait a little longer.
Your phone.
Hello?
I asked you to leave me alone, Bomba.
No, he didn't show up.
They're moving on to the next hearing.
What are you yelling at me for?
Who?
How do you know him?
All right.
Stop yelling!
Wait a second.
It's for you.
Yes.
Ronit?
They're going to operate?
When?
It will be all right.
- Are you sure?
Thank you...
Thank you very much.
Bye.
People, this case is never going to end.
If the witness doesn't come to us, we'll go to the witness.
- What?
He knows there are more operations today, he doesn't care.
He says it's Yom Kippur and he's burnt out.
He says you can kiss his ass.
What is this?
Dr. Alexandrov.
Where I am gonna find another surgeon now?
Hurry up!
Two floors down, at the end of the corridor.
Let's go.
What?
No, forget it, no one will come.
This way.
Pathology.
What is this smell...
It's disgusting...
- Come on, get in here.
Alexander Alexandrov.
We're going to end this matter right now.
It's a slaughter-house...
All I'm asking for is one sentence.
He's not talking.
Let's go.
Tell these people that you're Jewish, that your brother, Anna's father, was Jewish too.
My brother's dead, it's over.
Jews have a soul.
The soul is eternal.
Oh yeah?
Where is the soul?
Here are the kidneys, the stomach, the heart.
I've had 5 body-chopping shifts here.
There is no soul.
It's all flesh.
That's all there is.
The divine soul is in every Jew.
Oh yeah?
Okay.
You tell me.
Is he Jewish?
Arab?
Chinese?
Look for his soul.
All right.
There is a soul, there isn't a soul, just testify what you promised.
All right.
I'm Jewish, my father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, so was my brother Yuri, Anna's father.
That's not enough, that's not enough.
What?
"A claim must be established by two witnesses."
The judges are out cold.
There aren't enough witnesses.
Then what do you want?
For him to show he's circumcised.
- What?
That's the way it goes.
- That's the way what goes?
No witnesses, no permission.
Dr. Alexandrov, proceed to the operating room urgently.
Dr. Alexandrov, proceed to the operating room urgently.
Wake up!
You've gone too far, Miriam.
You could've made more of an effort.
You think someone made more of an effort for me?
- Yes.
Who?
The deceased?
Yes, my deceased husband made a big effort for your career.
I was his deputy and was appointed in his place.
That's all.
Wake up!
It wasn't my fault there was a financial scandal or that he got caught.
- And you didn't.
You didn't say a single word in his defense.
So he commits suicide?
It's against Jewish law.
It's even worse than murder.
There are things that I can't do.
I'm a religious man.
And what do you think I am?
- You?
You do whatever's convenient for you.
You feel sorry for the Russian girl so you flush the whole Torah down the drain.
You want to clear Yekutiel's name and the whole code of Jewish law has to bend for you.
Jewish law forbids you to be buried beside your husband and you know that, but you still ask, you appointed yourself Chief Rabbi!
All right, enough.
I relieve you of all my requests.
I'm sorry if I asked you to do things that you can't do.
Things that are against Jewish law, Miriam.
You're right, Pinhas.
All right.
I'm sorry for raising my voice.
So am I.
We tried.
All right.
We tried.
There's something I have to finish up.
Why are you yelling?
I'll have the pre-fast meal here.
I'll see the kids at synagogue.
Make sure to drink a lot, okay?
Mrs. Schwartz.
Yes?
Miriam...
- I'm waiting outside.
I'm truly sorry, but regarding the ashes...
If he was buried and no one knew where he was, no one would dig up the whole cemetery.
But the way things are now, I'm truly sorry.
I hope you understand...
All right.
I understand.
Have an easy fast.
- You too.
Well, Mom, what do you say?
Don't leave your gun there.
She's in surgery, he's in pathology, what do you have to say?
Good job, Avraham.
I'm like a little elf.
I come at the right time and fix everyone's lives.
Welcome, pre-fast meal.
Come, kreplach dumplings, come to Uncle Avraham.
Come, my dears.
Cover up you knees, just a little.
Stop it.
I'm not a child.
Let me dress as I please.
He's gonna kill you.
It's Yom Kippur.
People pray and cry...
People will lift their eyes and boom, there's your ass.
Pull it down a little.
Hello there.
What are you wearing, you jerk?
A white shirt.
What does it say on your pocket?
Christo.
It's the logo.
- Christo.
What's Christo?
Christ.
Jesus Christ.
You're bringing Jesus Christ to synagogue on Yom Kippur?
Go home and change your damn shirt.
I'm not going.
What did you say?
I'm not a child, I'll dress as I please.
Way to go, you've become a man.
Now get inside.
What was the slap for?
So you-know-what doesn't go to your head...
Come on.
The house was filled with the atmosphere of Yom Kippur.
I put on Grandpa's white kittel and my heart sank to my stomach.
"Who will rest and who will wander
"Who will live in harmony and who will be harried
"Who will enjoy tranquility and who will suffer
"Who will be impoverished and who will be enriched
"Who will be degraded and who will be exalted
"But repentance and prayer
"and charity remove
"the evil of the decree..."
Let's go, everyone's waiting, Avishai.
Anna, stay with me for a few minutes.
Mom.
You go ahead.
I'll come in a little while.
Don't you want to see your grandson praying?
Your son giving a sermon?
Go ahead.
We'll come in a little while.
Let's go, Dad, we're late.
Happy holiday.
- Happy holiday
- Happy holiday.
- Happy holiday.
Are you ready?
Where's your urn?
What do you mean?
- Let's go.
So, Bomba, Bnei Avraham is awakening?
Looks like everyone's gone to sleep.
Fuck.
- It's a shame you didn't write the sign in Russian.
Have a little faith, Pinhas.
It'll be all right.
If the Russians don't show up, we're in deep shit.
Start digging.
Your father made you swear to bring him to Jewish burial.
This is a Jewish burial.
We'll bury him here.
Get started.
I'm scared.
There's nothing to be scared of.
Everyone here is dead.
Go on.
"Let all our vows and oaths
"and the obligations We incur to You, O God,
"between this Yom Kippur and the next, be null and void
"should we, after honest effort,
"find ourselves unable to fulfill them..."
May you merit to do many mitzvahs.
- Thank you.
You kept your promise to your Dad.
After the holiday you could fly back home.
Yuri Alexandrov, everything we've done was on your behalf.
Forgive us if we've disrespected you in any way.
Say amen.
- Amen.
Always remember, it's ten steps from the last row, right next to this grave.
This is where we all will lay.
Read this.
"May His great Name be exalted and sanctified
"In the world that He created as He willed...
"May He give reign...
"In the world that He created as He willed
"May He give reign to His kingship..."
"In your lifetimes and in your days
"and in the lifetimes of the entire family of Israel."
"Amen."
Ronit.
How are you feeling?
How are you feeling?
Good.
Doctor.
I'm...
Okay, okay.
Feel better.
Miriam, let's go.
I'm cold.
Here.
You go ahead.
I want to stay for a while with my husband.
Are you sure?
Go.
They'll be back from synagogue soon.
You can keep the sweater as a souvenir from me.
You did great.
- Thanks, Dad.
Where's Grandma?
I don't know, I haven't seen her.
Anna isn't here either?
- I'm going to give my sermon.
Good luck.
Good luck.
The campaign's pinnacle moment had arrived and Bomba went up to give an election speech that would make the walls shake.
Dear friends.
On Yom Kippur...
On Yom Kippur, the heavens open up...
I prepared a sermon, but...
Last Yom Kippur, the 7-day mourning period over my father ended.
Most of you knew him, some of you came here with him and founded this place,
and we always hoped that new people would come here.
And they did.
They're here with us today, but we didn't know how to welcome them.
If my father was alive, he'd be standing here today, emotional,
he'd look at you and say:
You are our brothers.
This place is yours as much as it is ours.
Welcome.
I'd like to end with a prayer.
"May You regard our gathering together with love
"and obscure our sins with love.
"May You transform all hardship and evil
"to joy and gladness, to life and peace,
"for us and for all Israel who love truth and peace."
May you be inscribed in the Book of Life.
Thank you.
Anna had no idea what to do next.
Suddenly she got cold.
So she put on the blue sweater and sat on the stairs.
My name is Avishai Schwartz.
A cantor and bar-mitzvah teacher.
My wife's name is Anna and we named our newborn daughter Miriam.

Hello, Harry.
You're supposed to be in Washington.
I'm back.
I'm in line for the job of national security co-ordinator.
Run, you faint-hearted Liberals.
You tried to blackmail me, Juliet.
You wanted to continue to sabotage our operation.
It's not like you've never used dirty tricks to get where you are.
I was going to talk to Harry about making your stay here more permanent.
I've been shot at, tied up, accused of being a traitor.
Give me a desk next to Ruth and I'll think about it.
What's next for Mad Dog?
I think I'll call Mrs Mad Dog.
We work together usually and I want her back.
Save your anger, save your fear.
Patch the CCTV footage straight through to the grid, get me Tomahawk on a secure line.
Red flash the entire team.
Adam, I want you to get down there as soon as possible.
Save your fear, your disillusion, your anger.
You ready?
Yeah.
I'll take you out and present you.
There's a room put aside after for press interviews.
SHOUTING
SCREAMING
Six councillors in East London have defected to the British Way.
They've got control of the Housing Committee and have a policy of whites first, or "Families United", as they call it.
Illegal, surely.
Local residents aren't waiting for it to go to the High Court.
Plus, the British Way are organizing a rally.
Fiona's gone down to check the mood.
We don't need an MP like Sampson addressing them.
And Adam?
Gone to see if anyone's co-ordinating the housing estate trouble.
APPLAUSE
Now, they didn't want this man to speak to us tonight.
They reckon he was risking his political future because we're a bunch of extremists.
'But we all know that the political future lies with us. '
So, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the MP for North Dale Valley, William Sampson.
Thank you.
Now, today we saw what can happen when you ignore the anger of the British people.
I condemn categorically the violence on the estate but I also condemn the politicians who caused it to happen.
I've been called Islamophobic!
If that means taking action against those with a Koran in one hand and a dirty bomb in the other, then I plead guilty.
Leave her!
It's not worth it, there are CCTV cameras everywhere.
Do the car, do the car.
'Across our nation, I can feel the fear, 'the disillusion and most of all, the anger. '
I hereby give notice that I am leaving the bankrupt party I have served for 20 years.
I'm resigning my seat in parliament...
AUDIENCE MURMURS
.and I will stand as a candidate in the resulting by-election and, with your help, I will win...
..and become the first Member of Parliament elected for the British Way.
Oi!
Come here!
Oi!
Then...
Then, let them dare say that our views are unrepresentative of the British people.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Because tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
I am the voice of every frightened, disillusioned and angry person in Britain.
Politicians of all sides condemned the violence on the estates.
The rioting started after the far right British Way took control of the housing committee.
Over 30 families from ethnic minorities were driven from their homes, and more than 20 people required hospital treatment including five police officers.
The backlash has started already in chatrooms.
It's a mess.
The families are taking refuge in the local schools.
The police have to take them back.
Would you go back?
If not, it'd look like we accept ethnic cleansing.
We can't ask the families to make that point for us.
Were the British Way involved in the riots?
They were around but not joining in.
The mob needed no encouragement.
Well, now the mob has a mouthpiece.
The housewives' favourite.
Sampson was hitting every button in that rally.
He's loathsome.
Yeah, but the bar on loathsome politicians has been lowered considerably of late.
Sampson understands the mood of disillusion.
Fiona's right.
Normally the system's robust enough to see off the mavericks.
Things are different now.
OK, Harry, I'm all ears as to why we discovered Sampson's little plan at exactly the same time as the rest of the British public.
Seems like a significant intelligence failure from where I'm sitting.
Perhaps you should sit down.
If he wins...
Hewon'twin .
If he wins, it'll be a victory for fundamentalists of all types.
We all know what the Islamic extremists will be preaching.
We do intend to stop him winning.
That's fine but they're still dousing the flames on the estates.
A by-election fought on race is the last thing we need at the present time.
Of course.
So, what are you proposing to do?
We'll make the British Way eat itself.
Before we have to build walls to keep communities apart.
But with the opposition in such a mess, several MPs are thinking of following Sampson.
Take a close look at them.
Find us one we can work on.
The British Way are a legal party.
They're using the democratic process in order to destroy it.
So, we destroy the democratic process to save it?
So how does the operation work?
We start an internal war within the British Way just as we used to do with the Irish Republicans.
This picture represents both their greatest strength and the fault line.
Two politicians who, when working well together, are an unstoppable force.
But it's not pretty when they turn against each other.
Exactly.
Fiona will take charge of Sampson I'll look after Moran.
It'll be a two-pronged attack.
What about me?
Use that deviant imagination to head up the dirty tricks team on the election campaign.
Can you handle that?
What do you think?
Good.
We'll get Colin and Malcolm to work on the legends.
So we're going to make you a disillusioned British Way supporter.
Here's your wardrobe.
We've also backstopped your legend.
Here are the letters you got in prison.
These are probation office details, newspaper clippings you kept about the hit and run on an Asian kid and your trial.
Details of a fight in prison with a black inmate, and a letter from the housing department confirming your transfer from Croydon.
We've got an asset called Isis whom you can use to justify your presence.
She's your Auntie May.
Whenever she's in there'll be red tulips in the window.
Where does she live?
63 Frensham Road.
Before that, 17 Highfont Drive.
You've applied to join the party, you asked to speak to Keith Moran.
Here's the letter.
Won't that look odd?
With my CV he'll be curious.
This one has texts, photos and numbers of mates in Croydon.
This one is for status reports.
Every 24 hours.
Not necessary.
I've just read the report of Keith Moran's CO when he was a soldier serving with the Paras.
Warns of serious psychopathic tendencies.
Also, the results of a court martial for the "accidental" discharge of a weapon, which killed a black recruit.
Moran got off.
This one is for status reports, every 24 hours, please.
Does Sampson know about Moran's violent past?
Of course.
As long as it's useful to Sampson, he'll use it.
In an emergency speed-dial on hash three and we'll get back-up to you.
Use Auntie May to send more detailed reports.
Let's hope Sampson's taken in.
Is it not a disgrace that our fire-fighters and nurses cannot live next to their places of work?
Some might say the solution is to build more houses.
Or stop giving the ones we have to asylum seekers and then...
What you up to?
Building my legend for the internet.
Emily Glover went to Roedean School and Christ Church College, Oxford.
Professional background?
Works in advertising.
Advised the government on presenting its case for GM Foods and arms sales to unethical regimes.
Quite the rising star.
Made a director at Portman-Bright last year.
I like Emily.
She's quite the girl about town.
He went to the zoo today.
Keeps going on about seeing a lizard with no feet.
A lizard with no feet?
Isn't that a snake?
Tell you what, if either of us is around at all over the next month, we can ask him.
I got my first meeting with Keith Moran at British Way headquarters.
What kind of a world is he going to know?
Shhh, he's dreaming about lizards with no feet.
Sometimes I think it was stupid or selfish of us, to have a child.
He came from an act of love between us.
It's neither stupid nor selfish.
Mr Sampson?
Emily Glover, Portman-Bright lobbyists.
Public Affairs.
Quick minute of your time?
Yeah, sure.
My company lobbies for several large corporations and some clients are concerned at the way society's coming apart at the seams.
Then they know who they should be supporting.
You're not the only alternative.
We're the only one in touch with how people really feel.
You have a high opinion of yourself.
That's good.
Well, name me any social demographic and I'll tell you their hopes and their fears.
But you know that already or you wouldn't be anywhere near me.
We'll be watching closely, Mr Sampson.
Google Emily Glover for me, would you?
You're a long way from Croydon, Luke Chivers.
I can't live there any more.
I've got an aunt who lives in Luton so I arranged a housing transfer.
Is she a party member, your aunt?
Live and let live.
Well, that's what we believe in these days.
Not what we believed when we were taking back our houses.
He was there.
Wouldn't have missed that one.
We got to focus on the electoral battle now.
I've done five years, for defending my people.
I used to look up to men like you.
Used to?
I just need to know, is there still a place for me here?
Course there is.
Look, we still believe the same stuff?
Look at that.
Who'd have thought that?
Since Sampson's joined us the phones haven't stopped.
Can't process the membership application forms fast enough.
Gonna need bigger premises once he's elected.
I know.
There'll always be a place for those who were with us at the beginning.
The soldiers.
All right.
All right.
Smell a journalist?
I'll look into the address and do a little security check, yeah?
If he's from Torchlight, we'll have to deal with him.
I'll get him out the way, you check his flat.
Harry.
Perry, meet Emily Glover who works for Portman-Bright.
This is Peregrine Howell-Davis.
MI5 employing PR bods are they?
I'm trying to persuade them to have beanbags at Thames House.
Ha!
Jolly good.
I understand you're thinking of joining William Sampson.
That would be a mistake.
Shouldn't you be out chasing Al-Qaeda?
Actually that's exactly what we are doing.
Don't see the link personally.
We need strong leadership.
Like Germany in 1933?
Now you're being ridiculous.
You wouldn't fit in the British Way, Perry.
I agree with their platform almost entirely.
They have changed.
He means YOU wouldn't fit in.
Because?
Because they haven't changed enough to accept homosexuals.
To be fair, neither has Mrs Howell-Davis.
Although they do say half the SA taken out on the Night of the Long Knives were surprised with a strapping young Aryan lad in their beds so perhaps you'd like to take your chances?
Crude and a little predictable.
The most effective things so often are.
Sleep on it, Perry.
Hello Auntie May, erm, it's your favourite nephew, Luke.
I'm just calling to let you know I'm settling in OK and I'll be over to see you soon.
OK, bye.
A massive hunt is underway in Hull for Melanie Roberts who disappeared yesterday.
KNOCK AT DOOR
'Her bike was found in nearby woods, the police have expressed concern... '
Get your coat.
What, why?
I want to show you something.
All right.
Where are we going?
You'll see.
Great, the British Way are checking him out.
What am I supposed to be looking for?
A bittern.
It's a type of heron, has an unmistakable booming call.
Bloody rare.
Why did you bring me up here?
Wanted you to feel welcome.
This is excellent.
We've put some additional letters from Auntie May of 63, Frensham Road in there.
She still sends him five pounds and a Kit-Kat for his birthday.
Elderly relatives always have a problem with inflation.
Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to come up here and play.
That was a time when people never used to worry about paedophiles.
One of these days we should find ourselves a nonce and let him loose up here and hunt him down with guns.
I prefer a crossbow myself.
What type of bird's that?
Oh, it's a woodlark, "Lullula arborea".
That's his Latin name.
Bit like a skylark with a shorter tail.
Immigrants.
What?
Well, they come over here from abroad, don't they?
Yeah, well they find their own food and don't try and groom my daughter.
Good point.
How did you get into bird watching?
Dad used to bring me.
What does he do, your old man?
Asbestosis got him.
Used to come up here till, you know, near the end, though.
Said it used to help him forget about everything.
It's peaceful.
Yeah, yeah.
You still got doubts about the party?
I felt the power that night when we were in charge of those estates.
Mmm.
We sent the immigrants and the asylum seekers packing.
When you could see the faces of the police, you knew they were scared of us.
Imagine what it will be like when we're really running things.
Not with Sampson.
He's just another politician who'll betray us.
He keeps you well out of sight.
Who are you to question us, eh?
I mean what are you trying to do?
You want some award for undercover journalism?
Me on tape saying I throw pig's heads into mosques?
That's a pretty serious accusation.
Think you can back it up?
You know, while we're here, my men are in your flat.
What have you got to hide?
Guess you'll have to wait for them to tell you that.
You know the last infiltrator we uncovered, he hasn't been seen in a while.
No, I don't think you're a journalist.
Oh, yeah, why's that?
I can smell fear.
BOOMING
Hear that?
That booming noise.
Think it was a bittern.
MOBILE RINGS
Must be your boys reporting back.
Smell my fear now?
Reconsidered, Perry?
Harry!
Our party's in real trouble.
Last by-election we were in fourth place.
Fourth!
We used to lead this nation.
Then stay and rescue the party.
The mood in the country is changing and we must follow that mood.
Burning houses?
Refugees in schools?
That was a mob.
The British Way and the mob are like Siamese twins.
Look, I have grown attached to a stable two-party...
Three.
What?
We're including the little Scottish chap?
Three-party system.
Let's not throw away something that's served us so well.
What do you want me to do?
You'll be joining Sampson.
But I thought...
Ah, there's always a twist.
We've been hearing stories from Guildford, for example, that Albanian asylum seekers are trying to set up prostitution rings in the town.
They can threaten me with as many court appearances as they like,
I won't be intimidated.
It is a national disgrace and something should be done about it.
Sampson's mentioned this Guildford thing a few times now.
Of course.
One asylum seeker asks a white girl the time, you got a mob burning down a hostel.
Better warn Chief Constables about provocations.
Forgive me, Harry, but Sampson's riding very high.
Then the fall will be even more painful.
It had better be.
If Sampson wins this election he won't be the last British Way MP.
What have you got for me?
A British Way leaflet we've produced which makes derogatory comments about another candidate's disabled child.
Should lose them some sympathy.
That's the idea.
Have you got that list of speaking venues?
I'll make sure they're double-booked for Gambler's Anonymous meetings.
What's that?
Data from the highly respectable polling company, Blake Research.
We got them to poll on all the issues that people want Sampson to talk about and then we fiddled with the findings.
Good.
Let's keep him off-message.
Erm, any news from Adam?
Just awaiting his status report.
Oh, I thought it would've come in by now.
Do you want me to tell you when it comes in?
Yeah, sure, if I'm around.
Fiona?
He'll be all right.
Luke!
I think they trust me now but they might still be keeping an eye on me.
Didn't see anybody watching you.
What if the tulips die?
Shhhh.
They're plastic!
I need some help from base.
Here's my report for when the postman comes.
He's nice, your postman.
Careful with that boy, he's trouble.
Morning.
Morning.
Who's that?
A real relative.
Your sister?
Flatterer.
News from Adam?
It's done.
We need another push on Moran.
He trusts Adam but he's remaining stubbornly loyal to Sampson.
Prepared to swallow his injured feelings cos he thinks he might become second in command.
Then we must make him realise he will never be second in command.
Time for stage two?
Ruth, you need to start preparing.
What for?
I'm sending you back to GCHQ, temporarily.
We need somebody on this op who has experience of GCHQ culture.
I use the word loosely.
I need somebody I can really trust on this, Ruth.
Right.
This should put him in a bad mood at the campaign trial.
Almost done with the makeover.
How we doing with the internet shopping order?
Oh, Christ.
Are you the owner of this property, sir?
Yes.
I'm from the Council Planning Department.
You cannot just repaint your door in a conservation area.
I didn't.
You can see the colour of all the other doors.
If everybody was to do it, it'd be aesthetic anarchy.
And who are you?
The Indian Civil Service?
No, I'm from the Planning Department as I think I mentioned.
Here's your Contravention Notice with details of the fine.
You've got 48 hours to pay, otherwise it doubles.
Good day.
Every single item.
Not one thing my PA actually ordered.
All the refrigerated goods were off and lobster sent as a replacement for washing powder.
What?
Dirty tricks.
Interfering with my internet shopping.
Right after some chippy little Asian tried to fine me for changing my door colour.
Oh, you can't do that in a conservation area, Bill.
Not without permission.
I didn't!
Oh, never mind.
Well, this might cheer you up.
A client who might make a substantial donation to the party.
And I've spoken to Fitz and to Peter.
Tomlinson?
But he could bring Roger and Neil with him.
Tide's turning our way.
Especially after the Guildford problem.
Give me lobster over washing powder any day.
Well, I might just do that one evening.
Well, you can take your Fatfighters and you can shove it up your fat arse!
MAN CHUCKLES
TV: 'Screw you!
'
I know somebody.
Somebody?
Somebody who works for the Government.
And?
My cousin.
Not exactly one of us but she was up for promotion and guess who they gave the job to.
One of our little ethnic friends who was much less qualified.
What do you mean, works for the Government?
Can't really say.
She used to give us information about commies to stick on the website.
Told me a thing or two about Sampson.
What sort of thing?
Purge is coming.
Sampson's been talking about it with other members of the Executive Committee.
Lesley's an admin officer for a department that listens in to everything.
I'm on the Executive Committee.
I've heard nothing about any purge.
Yeah, I wonder why.
Introduce me to your cousin, then.
You're joking, aren't you?
She'd run a mile from somebody like you.
Another sleepless night for Herr Sampson.
The neighbours won't be best pleased either.
Collateral damage.
Tributes have been pouring in for murdered schoolgirl, Melanie Roberts.
Her head teacher described her as a popular child...
He cut her throat?
This will cause chaos.
Melanie's body was discovered today in a disused garage.
Police are refusing to comment on reports circulating about the cause of her death but they have confirmed that a 37-year-old man of Afghan origin has been charged with her murder.
Appears to have been an asylum seeker who was tortured in his home country.
Was being treated for psychological illness, liked extremist websites.
Sampson's gone up to Hull to take flowers to the spot where the body was found.
Oh, that's beautiful(!
)
First they provoke the conditions that cause the tragedy, then shed crocodile tears over it.
We hear a lot of talk these days about rights.
Particularly the rights of asylum seekers and terrorists.
But didn't Melanie Roberts have rights?
Didn't Melanie Roberts have the right to play outside her own home without having her throat cut?
Now to the sneering elites, people round here are white trash, inbreds, rednecks.
Only good for creating the wealth of the country and sending their sons to fight in foreign wars.
They love asylum seekers in Islington because they make good cleaning ladies and they don't have to live next to them.
You all know that I have resigned my seat in parliament to fight again for the British Way.
And when we win, it won't be a victory for me, but for all the decent folk who mourn here today and for the memory of Melanie Roberts, murdered by a man who had no business being here in the first place.
JOURNALISTS SHOUT QUESTIONS
Absolutely bloody lamentable, Harry.
It just complicates things a little.
I'm not sure you can keep control of this tiger that you're currently riding.
You never used to lose your nerve so easily.
The British Way haven't got anybody else with Sampson's charisma.
It would be very unfortunate if anything happened to him.
No.
We could make it a white, left-wing extremist.
Things are bad enough right now.
It would be like throwing petrol on the flames.
Short-term chaos for long-term stability?
Let me deal with this my way.
If Sampson wins his seat it'll change everything.
They have to be seen to destroy themselves.
Everything else is going to plan.
Where's the fall?
Dealing with Sampson in the way you suggest is not an option.
I'm sorry?
If I float an idea, by definition it IS an option.
You're just telling me you think it's a bad one.
I'm telling you it's not the best one.
OK.
But mess this up and you're on your own.
Could I have that in writing?
There have been further violent clashes in response to the death of Melanie Roberts.
News is coming in from Cardiff of an Iraqi man who has been beaten to death by a furious crowd.
The victim, who'd been tortured in the jails of Saddam Hussein, was married with children...
Tell that to the family of Melanie Roberts.
The police expressed concern at the cycle of revenge attacks and are asking for calm.
You're watching Sky News...
Let's go.
Where to?
Come on.
We're not missing out on this.
We're going hunting.
Thought we were avoiding violence during the election.
We got a surprise pass for the weekend.
What you doing?
What?
Boss, he's trying to use his mobile.
So?
Thought you might like a photo for a souvenir.
Shut up, Brian.
Let me do it.
What?
Let me.
No, another time.
Come on, for all those years I spent inside.
No.
Wait!
They killed one of our kids.
Let's do one of theirs.
What, you haven't got the bottle?
Have you?
Come on, hurry up, we're exposed here.
Shit!
What did you do that for?
What?
You moved.
No, I never.
Give me another bolt!
Never mind.
You winged the guy.
Forget the kid, let's move it.
And you introduce me to that cousin of yours, or so help me I'll go and find her myself.
I think, given the choice, most people would prefer a crossbow bolt in the leg to their head.
But couldn't you...
Missedthem altogether?
I saved his life.
If my cover gets blown now we lose this op and people will die.
OK, what do you want me to do?
It's time for the cousin.
She can be so outraged by the death of the child that she's decided to come forward.
Fiona must bait the trap now.
Their donation's secure. £500, 000.
Excellent.
There is a condition.
Which is?
Several of us want Moran and his men out of the party.
Too many negative associations.
Yes, but Moran is part of the old guard, he commands huge support.
Very difficult to remove.
Some MPs are still undecided.
Make Perry your number two.
Well...
give me time.
Might be better to do it after the election.
We can't alienate the rank and file when there's canvassing to be done.
Well, he has a point.
Moran's men may be a bunch of inbreds but somebody has to slog around those god-awful council estates.
But you can give me your word that after the by-election you'll expel Moran and his supporters and make Perry your deputy?
It's a done deal.
We have to admit that it is impeccable timing.
What is?
Well, asylum seeker murders photogenic little white girl...
Come on, don't tell me you didn't raise a small cheer inside.
Let's take a look at the latest polls, shall we?
Nice here.
Well, nowhere's safe.
Just look at that poor little girl.
But Cheltenham's not like London.
Don't get your handbag stolen by drug addicts.
You mean niggers.
I don't like that kind of language.
If you're going to talk like that I'm not speaking to you any more.
Lesley...
No,Luke,
I've said this to you before.
Not all coloured people are bad.
Then what are you doing here?
I thought you agreed with us.
I support the British Way because we're only a little island and we can't take any more immigrants.
I'm not a racialist though and I, I don't like bad language.
Oh, Les, we've come all this way.
Your mum was really pleased.
And look, I got some photos of when we done a barbecue.
Look.
Henry and Gavin arguing over the barbeque as usual!
Luke says that you work for the Government?
That they passed you over for promotion in favour of a...
I just want what's fair, that's all.
That Asian girl had only worked there a few months.
I've been there 15 years, not a day off sick.
Well, once, when I'd got back from Minorca and I'd eaten a big paella the night before getting on the plane.
Sick!
I should have had the bloody omelette.
My husband John had the omelette and he was fine.
Tell him what you've been working on, Les.
OK, well...
my section has been tasked...
That's what we call it in my line of work... tomonitor certain organisations.
The British Way is one of them.
Now we listen to traffic, speaking all technical again!
Erm, not like cars and stuff but, erm, exchanges of information between people.
Phone calls, e-mails...
They've been listening to Sampson.
So?
These...
Erm, these, these are transcripts of his conversations with an MP called Peregrine Howell-Davis and some lobbyist.
Transcripts?
And I have a tape.
I don't know, Luke.
I...
This could get me the sack.
You can trust Keith.
You have to get rid of it afterwards.
It's fine, I'll look after it.
Come on, let's get going.
I don't want to get her into trouble.
Don't forget your photos.
TAPE:
Their donation's secure, £500, 000.
Excellent.
There is a condition.
Which is?
Several of us want Moran and his men out of the party.
Too many negative associations.
Moran is part of the old guard and commands huge support, very difficult to remove.
Some MPs are still undecided.
Make Perry your number two.
Well, give me time.
It would be better to do it after the election.
We can't alienate the rank and file when there's canvassing to do.
Well, he has a point.
Moran's men may be a bunch of inbreds but somebody has to slog around those god-awful council estates.
But you can give me your word that after the by-election you will expel Moran and his supporters and make Perry your deputy?
It's a done deal.
It's always the same, isn't it?
What is?
My granddad was injured at the Battle of Ypres.
Dad died of asbestosis.
We're just nothing really, are we?
White trash, bunch of inbreds for everybody to laugh at.
We can take the party back from him.
You'll be our leader.
We don't need some MP taking cheques from big businesses to sell us out.
Let's see how Sampson copes without a shower on his big day.
Harry.
Sampson's holding a press conference today and if what I'm hearing is correct, you'd better be right on top of your game or there'll be consequences.
Fiona, we ready?
The tanks are rolling.
Did you have a shower this morning?
No bloody water in my house.
That car alarm again, if I find the owner...
Where'sPerry?
He'll be along shortly with the rest.
You nervous?
Nervous!
No, no, no.
I'll tell you what is amazing.
When people write the history books, this day will go down as a turning point in British politics and we were here, you and I.
Excited.
Good.
Use the adrenaline.
Oh, yeah.
MOBILE RINGS
Oh...
Perry.
Great.
OK, thanks.
Yeah, so what's, what's going on?
Perry's assembling the MPs.
They'll file in one by one for maximum effect.
OK.
Neil's wearing an astonishing tie, apparently.
Well, that's Neil for you.
He'd make a very good spokesperson.
Camera-friendly.
We'll see.
You have been fantastic.
Hear that?
What?
Tiny tremors.
The political landscape is shifting.
Let's go.
Good morning!
Morning.
Good morning.
Now, we are, at present, at the beginning of a new era.
And I'd like to dedicate this moment to the memory of Melanie Roberts.
And so, joining me on stage is Peregrine Howell-Davis, my campaign manager.
Bringing with him ten new British Way MPs.
Mr Sampson, where are your fellow MPs?
Are they not prepared to support burning people out of their houses?
REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS
Woah, woah, woah!
No pictures!
Please just wait!
Please, please just wait!
I said no pictures.
Will you stop taking...
No, stop it!
I'm afraid that William Sampson is a delusional and dangerous megalomaniac who exploits violence for his own ends and who has made a number of despicable off-the-record remarks about the poor child murdered in Hull, which do not bear repeating.
There was never any question that either myself or my colleagues would join him.
Frankly, the man is a liar and unfit to hold a seat in parliament.
Stage one's complete.
Well, I, I can't really say any more at this stage until I consult with my colleagues.
I'm not making any comments about the events in Westminster this morning.
My real colleagues are those on the Executive Committee of the party and I look forward to their full support and a victory for common-sense and decency in North Dale Valley.
Is it decent for you to attack disabled children in your election campaign?
I haven't seen the leaflet but those responsible will be disciplined.
We can go on to win this by-election without those cowards and traitors who promised me their support.
But now more than ever, we need...
The only coward and traitor in this room is you.
Expel me?
Expel me?
!
Expel me, you bastard?
I'll break your neck!
You are insane.
We're taking the party back for its members.
I heard what you've been saying about me.
Liar!
You lying bastard!
MOBILE RINGS
HE SIGHS
Yeah?
Mr Sampson, this is the establishment calling.
How do you feel now that we've introduced a little colour to your life?
More problems for William Sampson today, as violence broke out at a British Way meeting.
Police broke up the warring factions as opinion polls showed a dramatic slump in support for the far-right organisation, which has been riven with internal divisions.
A textbook operation.
Squeezed at every level, the party split right down the middle.
Well done.
Polls are showing a drop in support for Sampson.
What's the latest from Adam?
He's helping get the Real British Way started and ensuring it's filled with nutters and informers.
Ruth, I want you to visit Isis again with some more GCHQ files and help him out.
I don't have to see Moran this time?
Probably not, but if necessary I'm sure you could carry it off as well as last time.
What news from Westminster?
Howell-Davis has been promoted to the shadow cabinet.
Nice to see men of principle rewarded( !
)
He's dropping hints about the Honours list.
Not in my lifetime.
You tell him his only honour comes from serving his country.
MOBILE RINGS
What do you want?
We have to talk.
Look I'm coming up so arrange somewhere discreet for us to meet.
Look don't be such a bloody fool, man.
MI5 have been playing us off against each other and we've walked into every trap they've set for us.
You've got balls, I'll give you that.
I could hunt you down, bury you in that copse over there and nobody would be the wiser.
I want to rebuild things.
Rebuild things?
Now, you say that you heard things on tape, that must have been a set-up.
Don't you lie to me!
They said you were racist scum we should get rid of.
Now has anybody appeared suddenly telling you bad things about me?
We should stay together.
Let's put the party back on the road.
Stay together?
With you?
No, what's done is done.
The party will never be safe with men like you.
But if what you're saying is true, somebody's gonna pay.
DOORBELL RINGS
Ah, yes?
We've come on behalf of your nephew, Luke Chivers.
Oh, yes.
Is anything the matter?
Everything's fine.
Can, er, we come in?
Certainly.
What can I do for you young men?
Luke was wondering if he could, er, have a Twix for his next birthday.
Would you like tea?
Umm, three sugars please.
Who's Luke Chivers?
Adam, it's Ruth.
I'm outside the Isis safe house but there's no answer and the door's ajar.
Are there tulips in the window?
Yes.
OK, wait for me, I'll be there in ten minutes.
Why have they let us go?
They haven't let us go.
Then why...
Adam?
Quick, run!
Go on, run, I've got all day and I know this place like the back of my hand.
We're trapped here.
Adam, he's going to kill us.
He wants me more than you, get out.
I can't leave you.
I'll hold him up.
Go!
Go.
You're losing your touch.
You got time to reload?
Bye-bye, traitor.
I can offer you a deal.
I'm not like you, I have beliefs.
I don't do deals.
I've given my life to this party, for my people.
Your people?
Yes, my people.
Every soldier in a foreign graveyard, every worker whose job's been taken by a foreigner, every man or woman who loves the country that shits on them over and over again.
A crossbow bolt would be preferable to a lecture on patriotism from a murderer like you.
Then I am happy to oblige.
Shall I hit him again, Adam?
Only if you want to.
You're front-page news.
Cheer up, that'll definitely have just lost Sampson his deposit.
I've given my life for this movement.
Yes, you have.
But how hard did we have to push to make Sampson offer you up?
Doesn't that make you wonder about the movement?
I'm not like Sampson and I'm not a traitor like you.
No, you're not.
There's always a reckoning, though.
What?
You're like the SS officer who treats his own children with love and then smacks the legs of Jewish kids with the truncheon as he herds them onto cattle trucks.
I look after my own.
I'll tell that to the grandchildren of my colleague that you drowned.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You can't pin that on me.
You'd have to give evidence, reveal that she was a spy.
You're right.
But you did mention the body of an infiltrator.
The police are there now, they'll probably want DNA samples from you when we're finished.
Pretty straightforward murder case, I would have thought.
Under police escort, the first families are beginning to return to the very homes they were driven from earlier this month.
But it might yet take some time for the wounds of that violent evening to heal.
It'll help that the British Way don't have an MP.
There are concerns now about the disillusionment from the electorate towards politicians.
The way this election has been fought has now raised serious questions about the political landscape of contemporary Britain.
Yes, Sampson losing his deposit really was very satisfactory.
Still...
What?
Theturnoutwasvery low and a pantomime horse did better than some of the main candidates.
It doesn't make people fascists to want decent housing for their children.
Ignore their concerns and people like Sampson won't be away for very long.
Glad to have you back.
He'll come.
For what purpose?
To lead a major terrorist attack.
You're thinking of going after Yazdi.
Am I?
Don't.
I don't want any trouble, do you understand?
I can't offer you words of comfort, we both know how dangerous this is.
Get him out of there!
Subtitled by BBC Broadcast.

Hello, Harry.
You're supposed to be in Washington.
I'm back.
I'm in line for the job of national security co-ordinator.
Run, you faint-hearted Liberals.
You tried to blackmail me, Juliet.
You wanted to continue to sabotage our operation.
It's not like you've never used dirty tricks to get where you are.
I was going to talk to Harry about making your stay here more permanent.
I've been shot at, tied up, accused of being a traitor.
Give me a desk next to Ruth and I'll think about it.
What's next for Mad Dog?
I think I'll call Mrs Mad Dog.
We work together usually and I want her back.
Save your anger, save your fear.
Patch the CCTV footage straight through to the grid, get me Tomahawk on a secure line.
Red flash the entire team.
Adam, I want you to get down there as soon as possible.
Save your fear, your disillusion, your anger.
You ready?
Yeah.
I'll take you out and present you.
There's a room put aside after for press interviews.
SHOUTING
SCREAMING
Six councillors in East London have defected to the British Way.
They've got control of the Housing Committee and have a policy of whites first, or "Families United", as they call it.
Illegal, surely.
Local residents aren't waiting for it to go to the High Court.
Plus, the British Way are organizing a rally.
Fiona's gone down to check the mood.
We don't need an MP like Sampson addressing them.
And Adam?
Gone to see if anyone's co-ordinating the housing estate trouble.
APPLAUSE
Now, they didn't want this man to speak to us tonight.
They reckon he was risking his political future because we're a bunch of extremists.
'But we all know that the political future lies with us. '
So, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the MP for North Dale Valley, William Sampson.
Thank you.
Now, today we saw what can happen when you ignore the anger of the British people.
I condemn categorically the violence on the estate but I also condemn the politicians who caused it to happen.
I've been called Islamophobic!
If that means taking action against those with a Koran in one hand and a dirty bomb in the other, then I plead guilty.
Leave her!
It's not worth it, there are CCTV cameras everywhere.
Do the car, do the car.
'Across our nation, I can feel the fear, 'the disillusion and most of all, the anger. '
I hereby give notice that I am leaving the bankrupt party I have served for 20 years.
I'm resigning my seat in parliament...
AUDIENCE MURMURS
.and I will stand as a candidate in the resulting by-election and, with your help, I will win...
..and become the first Member of Parliament elected for the British Way.
Oi!
Come here!
Oi!
Then...
Then, let them dare say that our views are unrepresentative of the British people.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Because tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
I am the voice of every frightened, disillusioned and angry person in Britain.
Politicians of all sides condemned the violence on the estates.
The rioting started after the far right British Way took control of the housing committee.
Over 30 families from ethnic minorities were driven from their homes, and more than 20 people required hospital treatment including five police officers.
The backlash has started already in chatrooms.
It's a mess.
The families are taking refuge in the local schools.
The police have to take them back.
Would you go back?
If not, it'd look like we accept ethnic cleansing.
We can't ask the families to make that point for us.
Were the British Way involved in the riots?
They were around but not joining in.
The mob needed no encouragement.
Well, now the mob has a mouthpiece.
The housewives' favourite.
Sampson was hitting every button in that rally.
He's loathsome.
Yeah, but the bar on loathsome politicians has been lowered considerably of late.
Sampson understands the mood of disillusion.
Fiona's right.
Normally the system's robust enough to see off the mavericks.
Things are different now.
OK, Harry, I'm all ears as to why we discovered Sampson's little plan at exactly the same time as the rest of the British public.
Seems like a significant intelligence failure from where I'm sitting.
Perhaps you should sit down.
If he wins...
Hewon'twin .
If he wins, it'll be a victory for fundamentalists of all types.
We all know what the Islamic extremists will be preaching.
We do intend to stop him winning.
That's fine but they're still dousing the flames on the estates.
A by-election fought on race is the last thing we need at the present time.
Of course.
So, what are you proposing to do?
We'll make the British Way eat itself.
Before we have to build walls to keep communities apart.
But with the opposition in such a mess, several MPs are thinking of following Sampson.
Take a close look at them.
Find us one we can work on.
The British Way are a legal party.
They're using the democratic process in order to destroy it.
So, we destroy the democratic process to save it?
So how does the operation work?
We start an internal war within the British Way just as we used to do with the Irish Republicans.
This picture represents both their greatest strength and the fault line.
Two politicians who, when working well together, are an unstoppable force.
But it's not pretty when they turn against each other.
Exactly.
Fiona will take charge of Sampson I'll look after Moran.
It'll be a two-pronged attack.
What about me?
Use that deviant imagination to head up the dirty tricks team on the election campaign.
Can you handle that?
What do you think?
Good.
We'll get Colin and Malcolm to work on the legends.
So we're going to make you a disillusioned British Way supporter.
Here's your wardrobe.
We've also backstopped your legend.
Here are the letters you got in prison.
These are probation office details, newspaper clippings you kept about the hit and run on an Asian kid and your trial.
Details of a fight in prison with a black inmate, and a letter from the housing department confirming your transfer from Croydon.
We've got an asset called Isis whom you can use to justify your presence.
She's your Auntie May.
Whenever she's in there'll be red tulips in the window.
Where does she live?
63 Frensham Road.
Before that, 17 Highfont Drive.
You've applied to join the party, you asked to speak to Keith Moran.
Here's the letter.
Won't that look odd?
With my CV he'll be curious.
This one has texts, photos and numbers of mates in Croydon.
This one is for status reports.
Every 24 hours.
Not necessary.
I've just read the report of Keith Moran's CO when he was a soldier serving with the Paras.
Warns of serious psychopathic tendencies.
Also, the results of a court martial for the "accidental" discharge of a weapon, which killed a black recruit.
Moran got off.
This one is for status reports, every 24 hours, please.
Does Sampson know about Moran's violent past?
Of course.
As long as it's useful to Sampson, he'll use it.
In an emergency speed-dial on hash three and we'll get back-up to you.
Use Auntie May to send more detailed reports.
Let's hope Sampson's taken in.
Is it not a disgrace that our fire-fighters and nurses cannot live next to their places of work?
Some might say the solution is to build more houses.
Or stop giving the ones we have to asylum seekers and then...
What you up to?
Building my legend for the internet.
Emily Glover went to Roedean School and Christ Church College, Oxford.
Professional background?
Works in advertising.
Advised the government on presenting its case for GM Foods and arms sales to unethical regimes.
Quite the rising star.
Made a director at Portman-Bright last year.
I like Emily.
She's quite the girl about town.
He went to the zoo today.
Keeps going on about seeing a lizard with no feet.
A lizard with no feet?
Isn't that a snake?
Tell you what, if either of us is around at all over the next month, we can ask him.
I got my first meeting with Keith Moran at British Way headquarters.
What kind of a world is he going to know?
Shhh, he's dreaming about lizards with no feet.
Sometimes I think it was stupid or selfish of us, to have a child.
He came from an act of love between us.
It's neither stupid nor selfish.
Mr Sampson?
Emily Glover, Portman-Bright lobbyists.
Public Affairs.
Quick minute of your time?
Yeah, sure.
My company lobbies for several large corporations and some clients are concerned at the way society's coming apart at the seams.
Then they know who they should be supporting.
You're not the only alternative.
We're the only one in touch with how people really feel.
You have a high opinion of yourself.
That's good.
Well, name me any social demographic and I'll tell you their hopes and their fears.
But you know that already or you wouldn't be anywhere near me.
We'll be watching closely, Mr Sampson.
Google Emily Glover for me, would you?
You're a long way from Croydon, Luke Chivers.
I can't live there any more.
I've got an aunt who lives in Luton so I arranged a housing transfer.
Is she a party member, your aunt?
Live and let live.
Well, that's what we believe in these days.
Not what we believed when we were taking back our houses.
He was there.
Wouldn't have missed that one.
We got to focus on the electoral battle now.
I've done five years, for defending my people.
I used to look up to men like you.
Used to?
I just need to know, is there still a place for me here?
Course there is.
Look, we still believe the same stuff?
Look at that.
Who'd have thought that?
Since Sampson's joined us the phones haven't stopped.
Can't process the membership application forms fast enough.
Gonna need bigger premises once he's elected.
I know.
There'll always be a place for those who were with us at the beginning.
The soldiers.
All right.
All right.
Smell a journalist?
I'll look into the address and do a little security check, yeah?
If he's from Torchlight, we'll have to deal with him.
I'll get him out the way, you check his flat.
Harry.
Perry, meet Emily Glover who works for Portman-Bright.
This is Peregrine Howell-Davis.
MI5 employing PR bods are they?
I'm trying to persuade them to have beanbags at Thames House.
Ha!
Jolly good.
I understand you're thinking of joining William Sampson.
That would be a mistake.
Shouldn't you be out chasing Al-Qaeda?
Actually that's exactly what we are doing.
Don't see the link personally.
We need strong leadership.
Like Germany in 1933?
Now you're being ridiculous.
You wouldn't fit in the British Way, Perry.
I agree with their platform almost entirely.
They have changed.
He means YOU wouldn't fit in.
Because?
Because they haven't changed enough to accept homosexuals.
To be fair, neither has Mrs Howell-Davis.
Although they do say half the SA taken out on the Night of the Long Knives were surprised with a strapping young Aryan lad in their beds so perhaps you'd like to take your chances?
Crude and a little predictable.
The most effective things so often are.
Sleep on it, Perry.
Hello Auntie May, erm, it's your favourite nephew, Luke.
I'm just calling to let you know I'm settling in OK and I'll be over to see you soon.
OK, bye.
A massive hunt is underway in Hull for Melanie Roberts who disappeared yesterday.
KNOCK AT DOOR
'Her bike was found in nearby woods, the police have expressed concern... '
Get your coat.
What, why?
I want to show you something.
All right.
Where are we going?
You'll see.
Great, the British Way are checking him out.
What am I supposed to be looking for?
A bittern.
It's a type of heron, has an unmistakable booming call.
Bloody rare.
Why did you bring me up here?
Wanted you to feel welcome.
This is excellent.
We've put some additional letters from Auntie May of 63, Frensham Road in there.
She still sends him five pounds and a Kit-Kat for his birthday.
Elderly relatives always have a problem with inflation.
Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to come up here and play.
That was a time when people never used to worry about paedophiles.
One of these days we should find ourselves a nonce and let him loose up here and hunt him down with guns.
I prefer a crossbow myself.
What type of bird's that?
Oh, it's a woodlark, "Lullula arborea".
That's his Latin name.
Bit like a skylark with a shorter tail.
Immigrants.
What?
Well, they come over here from abroad, don't they?
Yeah, well they find their own food and don't try and groom my daughter.
Good point.
How did you get into bird watching?
Dad used to bring me.
What does he do, your old man?
Asbestosis got him.
Used to come up here till, you know, near the end, though.
Said it used to help him forget about everything.
It's peaceful.
Yeah, yeah.
You still got doubts about the party?
I felt the power that night when we were in charge of those estates.
Mmm.
We sent the immigrants and the asylum seekers packing.
When you could see the faces of the police, you knew they were scared of us.
Imagine what it will be like when we're really running things.
Not with Sampson.
He's just another politician who'll betray us.
He keeps you well out of sight.
Who are you to question us, eh?
I mean what are you trying to do?
You want some award for undercover journalism?
Me on tape saying I throw pig's heads into mosques?
That's a pretty serious accusation.
Think you can back it up?
You know, while we're here, my men are in your flat.
What have you got to hide?
Guess you'll have to wait for them to tell you that.
You know the last infiltrator we uncovered, he hasn't been seen in a while.
No, I don't think you're a journalist.
Oh, yeah, why's that?
I can smell fear.
BOOMING
Hear that?
That booming noise.
Think it was a bittern.
MOBILE RINGS
Must be your boys reporting back.
Smell my fear now?
Reconsidered, Perry?
Harry!
Our party's in real trouble.
Last by-election we were in fourth place.
Fourth!
We used to lead this nation.
Then stay and rescue the party.
The mood in the country is changing and we must follow that mood.
Burning houses?
Refugees in schools?
That was a mob.
The British Way and the mob are like Siamese twins.
Look, I have grown attached to a stable two-party...
Three.
What?
We're including the little Scottish chap?
Three-party system.
Let's not throw away something that's served us so well.
What do you want me to do?
You'll be joining Sampson.
But I thought...
Ah, there's always a twist.
We've been hearing stories from Guildford, for example, that Albanian asylum seekers are trying to set up prostitution rings in the town.
They can threaten me with as many court appearances as they like,
I won't be intimidated.
It is a national disgrace and something should be done about it.
Sampson's mentioned this Guildford thing a few times now.
Of course.
One asylum seeker asks a white girl the time, you got a mob burning down a hostel.
Better warn Chief Constables about provocations.
Forgive me, Harry, but Sampson's riding very high.
Then the fall will be even more painful.
It had better be.
If Sampson wins this election he won't be the last British Way MP.
What have you got for me?
A British Way leaflet we've produced which makes derogatory comments about another candidate's disabled child.
Should lose them some sympathy.
That's the idea.
Have you got that list of speaking venues?
I'll make sure they're double-booked for Gambler's Anonymous meetings.
What's that?
Data from the highly respectable polling company, Blake Research.
We got them to poll on all the issues that people want Sampson to talk about and then we fiddled with the findings.
Good.
Let's keep him off-message.
Erm, any news from Adam?
Just awaiting his status report.
Oh, I thought it would've come in by now.
Do you want me to tell you when it comes in?
Yeah, sure, if I'm around.
Fiona?
He'll be all right.
Luke!
I think they trust me now but they might still be keeping an eye on me.
Didn't see anybody watching you.
What if the tulips die?
Shhhh.
They're plastic!
I need some help from base.
Here's my report for when the postman comes.
He's nice, your postman.
Careful with that boy, he's trouble.
Morning.
Morning.
Who's that?
A real relative.
Your sister?
Flatterer.
News from Adam?
It's done.
We need another push on Moran.
He trusts Adam but he's remaining stubbornly loyal to Sampson.
Prepared to swallow his injured feelings cos he thinks he might become second in command.
Then we must make him realise he will never be second in command.
Time for stage two?
Ruth, you need to start preparing.
What for?
I'm sending you back to GCHQ, temporarily.
We need somebody on this op who has experience of GCHQ culture.
I use the word loosely.
I need somebody I can really trust on this, Ruth.
Right.
This should put him in a bad mood at the campaign trial.
Almost done with the makeover.
How we doing with the internet shopping order?
Oh, Christ.
Are you the owner of this property, sir?
Yes.
I'm from the Council Planning Department.
You cannot just repaint your door in a conservation area.
I didn't.
You can see the colour of all the other doors.
If everybody was to do it, it'd be aesthetic anarchy.
And who are you?
The Indian Civil Service?
No, I'm from the Planning Department as I think I mentioned.
Here's your Contravention Notice with details of the fine.
You've got 48 hours to pay, otherwise it doubles.
Good day.
Every single item.
Not one thing my PA actually ordered.
All the refrigerated goods were off and lobster sent as a replacement for washing powder.
What?
Dirty tricks.
Interfering with my internet shopping.
Right after some chippy little Asian tried to fine me for changing my door colour.
Oh, you can't do that in a conservation area, Bill.
Not without permission.
I didn't!
Oh, never mind.
Well, this might cheer you up.
A client who might make a substantial donation to the party.
And I've spoken to Fitz and to Peter.
Tomlinson?
But he could bring Roger and Neil with him.
Tide's turning our way.
Especially after the Guildford problem.
Give me lobster over washing powder any day.
Well, I might just do that one evening.
Well, you can take your Fatfighters and you can shove it up your fat arse!
MAN CHUCKLES
TV: 'Screw you!
'
I know somebody.
Somebody?
Somebody who works for the Government.
And?
My cousin.
Not exactly one of us but she was up for promotion and guess who they gave the job to.
One of our little ethnic friends who was much less qualified.
What do you mean, works for the Government?
Can't really say.
She used to give us information about commies to stick on the website.
Told me a thing or two about Sampson.
What sort of thing?
Purge is coming.
Sampson's been talking about it with other members of the Executive Committee.
Lesley's an admin officer for a department that listens in to everything.
I'm on the Executive Committee.
I've heard nothing about any purge.
Yeah, I wonder why.
Introduce me to your cousin, then.
You're joking, aren't you?
She'd run a mile from somebody like you.
Another sleepless night for Herr Sampson.
The neighbours won't be best pleased either.
Collateral damage.
Tributes have been pouring in for murdered schoolgirl, Melanie Roberts.
Her head teacher described her as a popular child...
He cut her throat?
This will cause chaos.
Melanie's body was discovered today in a disused garage.
Police are refusing to comment on reports circulating about the cause of her death but they have confirmed that a 37-year-old man of Afghan origin has been charged with her murder.
Appears to have been an asylum seeker who was tortured in his home country.
Was being treated for psychological illness, liked extremist websites.
Sampson's gone up to Hull to take flowers to the spot where the body was found.
Oh, that's beautiful(!
)
First they provoke the conditions that cause the tragedy, then shed crocodile tears over it.
We hear a lot of talk these days about rights.
Particularly the rights of asylum seekers and terrorists.
But didn't Melanie Roberts have rights?
Didn't Melanie Roberts have the right to play outside her own home without having her throat cut?
Now to the sneering elites, people round here are white trash, inbreds, rednecks.
Only good for creating the wealth of the country and sending their sons to fight in foreign wars.
They love asylum seekers in Islington because they make good cleaning ladies and they don't have to live next to them.
You all know that I have resigned my seat in parliament to fight again for the British Way.
And when we win, it won't be a victory for me, but for all the decent folk who mourn here today and for the memory of Melanie Roberts, murdered by a man who had no business being here in the first place.
JOURNALISTS SHOUT QUESTIONS
Absolutely bloody lamentable, Harry.
It just complicates things a little.
I'm not sure you can keep control of this tiger that you're currently riding.
You never used to lose your nerve so easily.
The British Way haven't got anybody else with Sampson's charisma.
It would be very unfortunate if anything happened to him.
No.
We could make it a white, left-wing extremist.
Things are bad enough right now.
It would be like throwing petrol on the flames.
Short-term chaos for long-term stability?
Let me deal with this my way.
If Sampson wins his seat it'll change everything.
They have to be seen to destroy themselves.
Everything else is going to plan.
Where's the fall?
Dealing with Sampson in the way you suggest is not an option.
I'm sorry?
If I float an idea, by definition it IS an option.
You're just telling me you think it's a bad one.
I'm telling you it's not the best one.
OK.
But mess this up and you're on your own.
Could I have that in writing?
There have been further violent clashes in response to the death of Melanie Roberts.
News is coming in from Cardiff of an Iraqi man who has been beaten to death by a furious crowd.
The victim, who'd been tortured in the jails of Saddam Hussein, was married with children...
Tell that to the family of Melanie Roberts.
The police expressed concern at the cycle of revenge attacks and are asking for calm.
You're watching Sky News...
Let's go.
Where to?
Come on.
We're not missing out on this.
We're going hunting.
Thought we were avoiding violence during the election.
We got a surprise pass for the weekend.
What you doing?
What?
Boss, he's trying to use his mobile.
So?
Thought you might like a photo for a souvenir.
Shut up, Brian.
Let me do it.
What?
Let me.
No, another time.
Come on, for all those years I spent inside.
No.
Wait!
They killed one of our kids.
Let's do one of theirs.
What, you haven't got the bottle?
Have you?
Come on, hurry up, we're exposed here.
Shit!
What did you do that for?
What?
You moved.
No, I never.
Give me another bolt!
Never mind.
You winged the guy.
Forget the kid, let's move it.
And you introduce me to that cousin of yours, or so help me I'll go and find her myself.
I think, given the choice, most people would prefer a crossbow bolt in the leg to their head.
But couldn't you...
Missedthem altogether?
I saved his life.
If my cover gets blown now we lose this op and people will die.
OK, what do you want me to do?
It's time for the cousin.
She can be so outraged by the death of the child that she's decided to come forward.
Fiona must bait the trap now.
Their donation's secure. £500, 000.
Excellent.
There is a condition.
Which is?
Several of us want Moran and his men out of the party.
Too many negative associations.
Yes, but Moran is part of the old guard, he commands huge support.
Very difficult to remove.
Some MPs are still undecided.
Make Perry your number two.
Well...
give me time.
Might be better to do it after the election.
We can't alienate the rank and file when there's canvassing to be done.
Well, he has a point.
Moran's men may be a bunch of inbreds but somebody has to slog around those god-awful council estates.
But you can give me your word that after the by-election you'll expel Moran and his supporters and make Perry your deputy?
It's a done deal.
We have to admit that it is impeccable timing.
What is?
Well, asylum seeker murders photogenic little white girl...
Come on, don't tell me you didn't raise a small cheer inside.
Let's take a look at the latest polls, shall we?
Nice here.
Well, nowhere's safe.
Just look at that poor little girl.
But Cheltenham's not like London.
Don't get your handbag stolen by drug addicts.
You mean niggers.
I don't like that kind of language.
If you're going to talk like that I'm not speaking to you any more.
Lesley...
No,Luke,
I've said this to you before.
Not all coloured people are bad.
Then what are you doing here?
I thought you agreed with us.
I support the British Way because we're only a little island and we can't take any more immigrants.
I'm not a racialist though and I, I don't like bad language.
Oh, Les, we've come all this way.
Your mum was really pleased.
And look, I got some photos of when we done a barbecue.
Look.
Henry and Gavin arguing over the barbeque as usual!
Luke says that you work for the Government?
That they passed you over for promotion in favour of a...
I just want what's fair, that's all.
That Asian girl had only worked there a few months.
I've been there 15 years, not a day off sick.
Well, once, when I'd got back from Minorca and I'd eaten a big paella the night before getting on the plane.
Sick!
I should have had the bloody omelette.
My husband John had the omelette and he was fine.
Tell him what you've been working on, Les.
OK, well...
my section has been tasked...
That's what we call it in my line of work... tomonitor certain organisations.
The British Way is one of them.
Now we listen to traffic, speaking all technical again!
Erm, not like cars and stuff but, erm, exchanges of information between people.
Phone calls, e-mails...
They've been listening to Sampson.
So?
These...
Erm, these, these are transcripts of his conversations with an MP called Peregrine Howell-Davis and some lobbyist.
Transcripts?
And I have a tape.
I don't know, Luke.
I...
This could get me the sack.
You can trust Keith.
You have to get rid of it afterwards.
It's fine, I'll look after it.
Come on, let's get going.
I don't want to get her into trouble.
Don't forget your photos.
TAPE:
Their donation's secure, £500, 000.
Excellent.
There is a condition.
Which is?
Several of us want Moran and his men out of the party.
Too many negative associations.
Moran is part of the old guard and commands huge support, very difficult to remove.
Some MPs are still undecided.
Make Perry your number two.
Well, give me time.
It would be better to do it after the election.
We can't alienate the rank and file when there's canvassing to do.
Well, he has a point.
Moran's men may be a bunch of inbreds but somebody has to slog around those god-awful council estates.
But you can give me your word that after the by-election you will expel Moran and his supporters and make Perry your deputy?
It's a done deal.
It's always the same, isn't it?
What is?
My granddad was injured at the Battle of Ypres.
Dad died of asbestosis.
We're just nothing really, are we?
White trash, bunch of inbreds for everybody to laugh at.
We can take the party back from him.
You'll be our leader.
We don't need some MP taking cheques from big businesses to sell us out.
Let's see how Sampson copes without a shower on his big day.
Harry.
Sampson's holding a press conference today and if what I'm hearing is correct, you'd better be right on top of your game or there'll be consequences.
Fiona, we ready?
The tanks are rolling.
Did you have a shower this morning?
No bloody water in my house.
That car alarm again, if I find the owner...
Where'sPerry?
He'll be along shortly with the rest.
You nervous?
Nervous!
No, no, no.
I'll tell you what is amazing.
When people write the history books, this day will go down as a turning point in British politics and we were here, you and I.
Excited.
Good.
Use the adrenaline.
Oh, yeah.
MOBILE RINGS
Oh...
Perry.
Great.
OK, thanks.
Yeah, so what's, what's going on?
Perry's assembling the MPs.
They'll file in one by one for maximum effect.
OK.
Neil's wearing an astonishing tie, apparently.
Well, that's Neil for you.
He'd make a very good spokesperson.
Camera-friendly.
We'll see.
You have been fantastic.
Hear that?
What?
Tiny tremors.
The political landscape is shifting.
Let's go.
Good morning!
Morning.
Good morning.
Now, we are, at present, at the beginning of a new era.
And I'd like to dedicate this moment to the memory of Melanie Roberts.
And so, joining me on stage is Peregrine Howell-Davis, my campaign manager.
Bringing with him ten new British Way MPs.
Mr Sampson, where are your fellow MPs?
Are they not prepared to support burning people out of their houses?
REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS
Woah, woah, woah!
No pictures!
Please just wait!
Please, please just wait!
I said no pictures.
Will you stop taking...
No, stop it!
I'm afraid that William Sampson is a delusional and dangerous megalomaniac who exploits violence for his own ends and who has made a number of despicable off-the-record remarks about the poor child murdered in Hull, which do not bear repeating.
There was never any question that either myself or my colleagues would join him.
Frankly, the man is a liar and unfit to hold a seat in parliament.
Stage one's complete.
Well, I, I can't really say any more at this stage until I consult with my colleagues.
I'm not making any comments about the events in Westminster this morning.
My real colleagues are those on the Executive Committee of the party and I look forward to their full support and a victory for common-sense and decency in North Dale Valley.
Is it decent for you to attack disabled children in your election campaign?
I haven't seen the leaflet but those responsible will be disciplined.
We can go on to win this by-election without those cowards and traitors who promised me their support.
But now more than ever, we need...
The only coward and traitor in this room is you.
Expel me?
Expel me?
!
Expel me, you bastard?
I'll break your neck!
You are insane.
We're taking the party back for its members.
I heard what you've been saying about me.
Liar!
You lying bastard!
MOBILE RINGS
HE SIGHS
Yeah?
Mr Sampson, this is the establishment calling.
How do you feel now that we've introduced a little colour to your life?
More problems for William Sampson today, as violence broke out at a British Way meeting.
Police broke up the warring factions as opinion polls showed a dramatic slump in support for the far-right organisation, which has been riven with internal divisions.
A textbook operation.
Squeezed at every level, the party split right down the middle.
Well done.
Polls are showing a drop in support for Sampson.
What's the latest from Adam?
He's helping get the Real British Way started and ensuring it's filled with nutters and informers.
Ruth, I want you to visit Isis again with some more GCHQ files and help him out.
I don't have to see Moran this time?
Probably not, but if necessary I'm sure you could carry it off as well as last time.
What news from Westminster?
Howell-Davis has been promoted to the shadow cabinet.
Nice to see men of principle rewarded( !
)
He's dropping hints about the Honours list.
Not in my lifetime.
You tell him his only honour comes from serving his country.
MOBILE RINGS
What do you want?
We have to talk.
Look I'm coming up so arrange somewhere discreet for us to meet.
Look don't be such a bloody fool, man.
MI5 have been playing us off against each other and we've walked into every trap they've set for us.
You've got balls, I'll give you that.
I could hunt you down, bury you in that copse over there and nobody would be the wiser.
I want to rebuild things.
Rebuild things?
Now, you say that you heard things on tape, that must have been a set-up.
Don't you lie to me!
They said you were racist scum we should get rid of.
Now has anybody appeared suddenly telling you bad things about me?
We should stay together.
Let's put the party back on the road.
Stay together?
With you?
No, what's done is done.
The party will never be safe with men like you.
But if what you're saying is true, somebody's gonna pay.
DOORBELL RINGS
Ah, yes?
We've come on behalf of your nephew, Luke Chivers.
Oh, yes.
Is anything the matter?
Everything's fine.
Can, er, we come in?
Certainly.
What can I do for you young men?
Luke was wondering if he could, er, have a Twix for his next birthday.
Would you like tea?
Umm, three sugars please.
Who's Luke Chivers?
Adam, it's Ruth.
I'm outside the Isis safe house but there's no answer and the door's ajar.
Are there tulips in the window?
Yes.
OK, wait for me, I'll be there in ten minutes.
Why have they let us go?
They haven't let us go.
Then why...
Adam?
Quick, run!
Go on, run, I've got all day and I know this place like the back of my hand.
We're trapped here.
Adam, he's going to kill us.
He wants me more than you, get out.
I can't leave you.
I'll hold him up.
Go!
Go.
You're losing your touch.
You got time to reload?
Bye-bye, traitor.
I can offer you a deal.
I'm not like you, I have beliefs.
I don't do deals.
I've given my life to this party, for my people.
Your people?
Yes, my people.
Every soldier in a foreign graveyard, every worker whose job's been taken by a foreigner, every man or woman who loves the country that shits on them over and over again.
A crossbow bolt would be preferable to a lecture on patriotism from a murderer like you.
Then I am happy to oblige.
Shall I hit him again, Adam?
Only if you want to.
You're front-page news.
Cheer up, that'll definitely have just lost Sampson his deposit.
I've given my life for this movement.
Yes, you have.
But how hard did we have to push to make Sampson offer you up?
Doesn't that make you wonder about the movement?
I'm not like Sampson and I'm not a traitor like you.
No, you're not.
There's always a reckoning, though.
What?
You're like the SS officer who treats his own children with love and then smacks the legs of Jewish kids with the truncheon as he herds them onto cattle trucks.
I look after my own.
I'll tell that to the grandchildren of my colleague that you drowned.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You can't pin that on me.
You'd have to give evidence, reveal that she was a spy.
You're right.
But you did mention the body of an infiltrator.
The police are there now, they'll probably want DNA samples from you when we're finished.
Pretty straightforward murder case, I would have thought.
Under police escort, the first families are beginning to return to the very homes they were driven from earlier this month.
But it might yet take some time for the wounds of that violent evening to heal.
It'll help that the British Way don't have an MP.
There are concerns now about the disillusionment from the electorate towards politicians.
The way this election has been fought has now raised serious questions about the political landscape of contemporary Britain.
Yes, Sampson losing his deposit really was very satisfactory.
Still...
What?
Theturnoutwasvery low and a pantomime horse did better than some of the main candidates.
It doesn't make people fascists to want decent housing for their children.
Ignore their concerns and people like Sampson won't be away for very long.
Glad to have you back.
He'll come.
For what purpose?
To lead a major terrorist attack.
You're thinking of going after Yazdi.
Am I?
Don't.
I don't want any trouble, do you understand?
I can't offer you words of comfort, we both know how dangerous this is.
Get him out of there!

Hello, Harry.
You're supposed to be in Washington.
I'm back.
I'm in line for the job of national security co-ordinator.
Run, you faint-hearted Liberals.
You tried to blackmail me, Juliet.
You wanted to continue to sabotage our operation.
It's not like you've never used dirty tricks to get where you are.
I was going to talk to Harry about making your stay here more permanent.
I've been shot at, tied up, accused of being a traitor.
Give me a desk next to Ruth and I'll think about it.
What's next for Mad Dog?
I think I'll call Mrs Mad Dog.
We work together usually and I want her back.
Save your anger, save your fear.
Patch the CCTV footage straight through to the grid, get me Tomahawk on a secure line.
Red flash the entire team.
Adam, I want you to get down there as soon as possible.
Save your fear, your disillusion, your anger.
You ready?
Yeah.
I'll take you out and present you.
There's a room put aside after for press interviews.
SHOUTING
SCREAMING
Six councillors in East London have defected to the British Way.
They've got control of the Housing Committee and have a policy of whites first, or "Families United", as they call it.
Illegal, surely.
Local residents aren't waiting for it to go to the High Court.
Plus, the British Way are organizing a rally.
Fiona's gone down to check the mood.
We don't need an MP like Sampson addressing them.
And Adam?
Gone to see if anyone's co-ordinating the housing estate trouble.
APPLAUSE
Now, they didn't want this man to speak to us tonight.
They reckon he was risking his political future because we're a bunch of extremists.
'But we all know that the political future lies with us. '
So, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the MP for North Dale Valley, William Sampson.
Thank you.
Now, today we saw what can happen when you ignore the anger of the British people.
I condemn categorically the violence on the estate but I also condemn the politicians who caused it to happen.
I've been called Islamophobic!
If that means taking action against those with a Koran in one hand and a dirty bomb in the other, then I plead guilty.
Leave her!
It's not worth it, there are CCTV cameras everywhere.
Do the car, do the car.
'Across our nation, I can feel the fear, 'the disillusion and most of all, the anger. '
I hereby give notice that I am leaving the bankrupt party I have served for 20 years.
I'm resigning my seat in parliament...
AUDIENCE MURMURS and I will stand as a candidate in the resulting by-election and, with your help, I will win...
..and become the first Member of Parliament elected for the British Way.
Oi!
Come here!
Oi!
Then...
Then, let them dare say that our views are unrepresentative of the British people.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Because tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
I am the voice of every frightened, disillusioned and angry person in Britain.
Politicians of all sides condemned the violence on the estates.
The rioting started after the far right British Way took control of the housing committee.
Over 30 families from ethnic minorities were driven from their homes, and more than 20 people required hospital treatment including five police officers.
The backlash has started already in chatrooms.
It's a mess.
The families are taking refuge in the local schools.
The police have to take them back.
Would you go back?
If not, it'd look like we accept ethnic cleansing.
We can't ask the families to make that point for us.
Were the British Way involved in the riots?
They were around but not joining in.
The mob needed no encouragement.
Well, now the mob has a mouthpiece.
The housewives' favourite.
Sampson was hitting every button in that rally.
He's loathsome.
Yeah, but the bar on loathsome politicians has been lowered considerably of late.
Sampson understands the mood of disillusion.
Fiona's right.
Normally the system's robust enough to see off the mavericks.
Things are different now.
OK, Harry, I'm all ears as to why we discovered Sampson's little plan at exactly the same time as the rest of the British public.
Seems like a significant intelligence failure from where I'm sitting.
Perhaps you should sit down.
If he wins...
He won't win.
If he wins, it'll be a victory for fundamentalists of all types.
We all know what the Islamic extremists will be preaching.
We do intend to stop him winning.
That's fine but they're still dousing the flames on the estates.
A by-election fought on race is the last thing we need at the present time.
Of course.
So, what are you proposing to do?
We'll make the British Way eat itself.
Before we have to build walls to keep communities apart.
But with the opposition in such a mess, several MPs are thinking of following Sampson.
Take a close look at them.
Find us one we can work on.
The British Way are a legal party.
They're using the democratic process in order to destroy it.
So, we destroy the democratic process to save it?
So how does the operation work?
We start an internal war within the British Way just as we used to do with the Irish Republicans.
This picture represents both their greatest strength and the fault line.
Two politicians who, when working well together, are an unstoppable force.
But it's not pretty when they turn against each other.
Exactly.
Fiona will take charge of Sampson I'll look after Moran.
It'll be a two-pronged attack.
What about me?
Use that deviant imagination to head up the dirty tricks team on the election campaign.
Can you handle that?
What do you think?
Good.
We'll get Colin and Malcolm to work on the legends.
So we're going to make you a disillusioned British Way supporter.
Here's your wardrobe.
We've also backstopped your legend.
Here are the letters you got in prison.
These are probation office details, newspaper clippings you kept about the hit and run on an Asian kid and your trial.
Details of a fight in prison with a black inmate, and a letter from the housing department confirming your transfer from Croydon.
We've got an asset called Isis whom you can use to justify your presence.
She's your Auntie May.
Whenever she's in there'll be red tulips in the window.
Where does she live?
63 Frensham Road.
Before that, 17 Highfont Drive.
You've applied to join the party, you asked to speak to Keith Moran.
Here's the letter.
Won't that look odd?
With my CV he'll be curious.
This one has texts, photos and numbers of mates in Croydon.
This one is for status reports.
Every 24 hours.
Not necessary.
I've just read the report of Keith Moran's CO when he was a soldier serving with the Paras.
Warns of serious psychopathic tendencies.
Also, the results of a court martial for the "accidental" discharge of a weapon, which killed a black recruit.
Moran got off.
This one is for status reports, every 24 hours, please.
Does Sampson know about Moran's violent past?
Of course.
As long as it's useful to Sampson, he'll use it.
In an emergency speed-dial on hash three and we'll get back-up to you.
Use Auntie May to send more detailed reports.
Let's hope Sampson's taken in.
Is it not a disgrace that our fire-fighters and nurses cannot live next to their places of work?
Some might say the solution is to build more houses.
Or stop giving the ones we have to asylum seekers and then...
What you up to?
Building my legend for the internet.
Emily Glover went to Roedean School and Christ Church College, Oxford.
Professional background?
Works in advertising.
Advised the government on presenting its case for GM Foods and arms sales to unethical regimes.
Quite the rising star.
Made a director at Portman-Bright last year.
I like Emily.
She's quite the girl about town.
He went to the zoo today.
Keeps going on about seeing a lizard with no feet.
A lizard with no feet?
Isn't that a snake?
Tell you what, if either of us is around at all over the next month, we can ask him.
I got my first meeting with Keith Moran at British Way headquarters.
What kind of a world is he going to know?
Shhh, he's dreaming about lizards with no feet.
Sometimes I think it was stupid or selfish of us, to have a child.
He came from an act of love between us.
It's neither stupid nor selfish.
Mr Sampson?
Emily Glover, Portman-Bright lobbyists.
Public Affairs.
Quick minute of your time?
Yeah, sure.
My company lobbies for several large corporations and some clients are concerned at the way society's coming apart at the seams.
Then they know who they should be supporting.
You're not the only alternative.
We're the only one in touch with how people really feel.
You have a high opinion of yourself.
That's good.
Well, name me any social demographic and I'll tell you their hopes and their fears.
But you know that already or you wouldn't be anywhere near me.
We'll be watching closely, Mr Sampson.
Google Emily Glover for me, would you?
You're a long way from Croydon, Luke Chivers.
I can't live there any more.
I've got an aunt who lives in Luton so I arranged a housing transfer.
Is she a party member, your aunt?
Live and let live.
Well, that's what we believe in these days.
Not what we believed when we were taking back our houses.
He was there.
Wouldn't have missed that one.
We got to focus on the electoral battle now.
I've done five years, for defending my people.
I used to look up to men like you.
Used to?
I just need to know, is there still a place for me here?
Course there is.
Look, we still believe the same stuff?
Look at that.
Who'd have thought that?
Since Sampson's joined us the phones haven't stopped.
Can't process the membership application forms fast enough.
Gonna need bigger premises once he's elected.
I know.
There'll always be a place for those who were with us at the beginning.
The soldiers.
All right.
All right.
Smell a journalist?
I'll look into the address and do a little security check, yeah?
If he's from Torchlight, we'll have to deal with him.
I'll get him out the way, you check his flat.
Harry.
Perry, meet Emily Glover who works for Portman-Bright.
This is Peregrine Howell-Davis.
MI5 employing PR bods are they?
I'm trying to persuade them to have beanbags at Thames House.
Ha!
Jolly good.
I understand you're thinking of joining William Sampson.
That would be a mistake.
Shouldn't you be out chasing Al-Qaeda?
Actually that's exactly what we are doing.
Don't see the link personally.
We need strong leadership.
Like Germany in 1933?
Now you're being ridiculous.
You wouldn't fit in the British Way, Perry.
I agree with their platform almost entirely.
They have changed.
He means YOU wouldn't fit in.
Because?
Because they haven't changed enough to accept homosexuals.
To be fair, neither has Mrs Howell-Davis.
Although they do say half the SA taken out on the Night of the Long Knives were surprised with a strapping young Aryan lad in their beds so perhaps you'd like to take your chances?
Crude and a little predictable.
The most effective things so often are.
Sleep on it, Perry.
Hello Auntie May, erm, it's your favourite nephew, Luke.
I'm just calling to let you know I'm settling in OK and I'll be over to see you soon.
OK, bye.
A massive hunt is underway in Hull for Melanie Roberts who disappeared yesterday.
KNOCK AT DOOR
'Her bike was found in nearby woods, the police have expressed concern... '
Get your coat.
What, why?
I want to show you something.
All right.
Where are we going?
You'll see.
Great, the British Way are checking him out.
What am I supposed to be looking for?
A bittern.
It's a type of heron, has an unmistakable booming call.
Bloody rare.
Why did you bring me up here?
Wanted you to feel welcome.
This is excellent.
We've put some additional letters from Auntie May of 63, Frensham Road in there.
She still sends him five pounds and a Kit-Kat for his birthday.
Elderly relatives always have a problem with inflation.
Yeah, when I was a kid, I used to come up here and play.
That was a time when people never used to worry about paedophiles.
One of these days we should find ourselves a nonce and let him loose up here and hunt him down with guns.
I prefer a crossbow myself.
What type of bird's that?
Oh, it's a woodlark, "Lullula arborea".
That's his Latin name.
Bit like a skylark with a shorter tail.
Immigrants.
What?
Well, they come over here from abroad, don't they?
Yeah, well they find their own food and don't try and groom my daughter.
Good point.
How did you get into bird watching?
Dad used to bring me.
What does he do, your old man?
Asbestosis got him.
Used to come up here till, you know, near the end, though.
Said it used to help him forget about everything.
It's peaceful.
Yeah, yeah.
You still got doubts about the party?
I felt the power that night when we were in charge of those estates.
Mmm.
We sent the immigrants and the asylum seekers packing.
When you could see the faces of the police, you knew they were scared of us.
Imagine what it will be like when we're really running things.
Not with Sampson.
He's just another politician who'll betray us.
He keeps you well out of sight.
Who are you to question us, eh?
I mean what are you trying to do?
You want some award for undercover journalism?
Me on tape saying I throw pig's heads into mosques?
That's a pretty serious accusation.
Think you can back it up?
You know, while we're here, my men are in your flat.
What have you got to hide?
Guess you'll have to wait for them to tell you that.
You know the last infiltrator we uncovered, he hasn't been seen in a while.
No, I don't think you're a journalist.
Oh, yeah, why's that?
I can smell fear.
BOOMING
Hear that?
That booming noise.
Think it was a bittern.
MOBILE RINGS
Must be your boys reporting back.
Smell my fear now?
Reconsidered, Perry?
Harry!
Our party's in real trouble.
Last by-election we were in fourth place.
Fourth!
We used to lead this nation.
Then stay and rescue the party.
The mood in the country is changing and we must follow that mood.
Burning houses?
Refugees in schools?
That was a mob.
The British Way and the mob are like Siamese twins.
Look, I have grown attached to a stable two-party...
Three.
What?
We're including the little Scottish chap?
Three-party system.
Let's not throw away something that's served us so well.
What do you want me to do?
You'll be joining Sampson.
But I thought...
Ah, there's always a twist.
We've been hearing stories from Guildford, for example, that Albanian asylum seekers are trying to set up prostitution rings in the town.
They can threaten me with as many court appearances as they like,
I won't be intimidated.
It is a national disgrace and something should be done about it.
Sampson's mentioned this Guildford thing a few times now.
Of course.
One asylum seeker asks a white girl the time, you got a mob burning down a hostel.
Better warn Chief Constables about provocations.
Forgive me, Harry, but Sampson's riding very high.
Then the fall will be even more painful.
It had better be.
If Sampson wins this election he won't be the last British Way MP.
What have you got for me?
A British Way leaflet we've produced which makes derogatory comments about another candidate's disabled child.
Should lose them some sympathy.
That's the idea.
Have you got that list of speaking venues?
I'll make sure they're double-booked for Gambler's Anonymous meetings.
What's that?
Data from the highly respectable polling company, Blake Research.
We got them to poll on all the issues that people want Sampson to talk about and then we fiddled with the findings.
Good.
Let's keep him off-message.
Erm, any news from Adam?
Just awaiting his status report.
Oh, I thought it would've come in by now.
Do you want me to tell you when it comes in?
Yeah, sure, if I'm around.
Fiona?
He'll be all right.
Luke!
I think they trust me now but they might still be keeping an eye on me.
Didn't see anybody watching you.
What if the tulips die?
Shhhh.
They're plastic!
I need some help from base.
Here's my report for when the postman comes.
He's nice, your postman.
Careful with that boy, he's trouble.
Morning.
Morning.
Who's that?
A real relative.
Your sister?
Flatterer.
News from Adam?
It's done.
We need another push on Moran.
He trusts Adam but he's remaining stubbornly loyal to Sampson.
Prepared to swallow his injured feelings cos he thinks he might become second in command.
Then we must make him realise he will never be second in command.
Time for stage two?
Ruth, you need to start preparing.
What for?
I'm sending you back to GCHQ, temporarily.
We need somebody on this op who has experience of GCHQ culture.
I use the word loosely.
I need somebody I can really trust on this, Ruth.
Right.
This should put him in a bad mood at the campaign trial.
Almost done with the makeover.
How we doing with the internet shopping order?
Oh, Christ.
Are you the owner of this property, sir?
Yes.
I'm from the Council Planning Department.
You cannot just repaint your door in a conservation area.
I didn't.
You can see the colour of all the other doors.
If everybody was to do it, it'd be aesthetic anarchy.
And who are you?
The Indian Civil Service?
No, I'm from the Planning Department as I think I mentioned.
Here's your Contravention Notice with details of the fine.
You've got 48 hours to pay, otherwise it doubles.
Good day.
Every single item.
Not one thing my PA actually ordered.
All the refrigerated goods were off and lobster sent as a replacement for washing powder.
What?
Dirty tricks.
Interfering with my internet shopping.
Right after some chippy little Asian tried to fine me for changing my door colour.
Oh, you can't do that in a conservation area, Bill.
Not without permission.
I didn't!
Oh, never mind.
Well, this might cheer you up.
A client who might make a substantial donation to the party.
And I've spoken to Fitz and to Peter.
Tomlinson?
But he could bring Roger and Neil with him.
Tide's turning our way.
Especially after the Guildford problem.
Give me lobster over washing powder any day.
Well, I might just do that one evening.
Well, you can take your Fatfighters and you can shove it up your fat arse!
MAN CHUCKLES
TV: 'Screw you!
'
I know somebody.
Somebody?
Somebody who works for the Government.
And?
My cousin.
Not exactly one of us but she was up for promotion and guess who they gave the job to.
One of our little ethnic friends who was much less qualified.
What do you mean, works for the Government?
Can't really say.
She used to give us information about commies to stick on the website.
Told me a thing or two about Sampson.
What sort of thing?
Purge is coming.
Sampson's been talking about it with other members of the Executive Committee.
Lesley's an admin officer for a department that listens in to everything.
I'm on the Executive Committee.
I've heard nothing about any purge.
Yeah, I wonder why.
Introduce me to your cousin, then.
You're joking, aren't you?
She'd run a mile from somebody like you.
Another sleepless night for Herr Sampson.
The neighbours won't be best pleased either.
Collateral damage.
Tributes have been pouring in for murdered schoolgirl, Melanie Roberts.
Her head teacher described her as a popular child...
He cut her throat?
This will cause chaos.
Melanie's body was discovered today in a disused garage.
Police are refusing to comment on reports circulating about the cause of her death but they have confirmed that a 37-year-old man of Afghan origin has been charged with her murder.
Appears to have been an asylum seeker who was tortured in his home country.
Was being treated for psychological illness, liked extremist websites.
Sampson's gone up to Hull to take flowers to the spot where the body was found.
Oh, that's beautiful(!
)
First they provoke the conditions that cause the tragedy, then shed crocodile tears over it.
We hear a lot of talk these days about rights.
Particularly the rights of asylum seekers and terrorists.
But didn't Melanie Roberts have rights?
Didn't Melanie Roberts have the right to play outside her own home without having her throat cut?
Now to the sneering elites, people round here are white trash, inbreds, rednecks.
Only good for creating the wealth of the country and sending their sons to fight in foreign wars.
They love asylum seekers in Islington because they make good cleaning ladies and they don't have to live next to them.
You all know that I have resigned my seat in parliament to fight again for the British Way.
And when we win, it won't be a victory for me, but for all the decent folk who mourn here today and for the memory of Melanie Roberts, murdered by a man who had no business being here in the first place.
JOURNALISTS SHOUT QUESTIONS
Absolutely bloody lamentable, Harry.
It just complicates things a little.
I'm not sure you can keep control of this tiger that you're currently riding.
You never used to lose your nerve so easily.
The British Way haven't got anybody else with Sampson's charisma.
It would be very unfortunate if anything happened to him.
No.
We could make it a white, left-wing extremist.
Things are bad enough right now.
It would be like throwing petrol on the flames.
Short-term chaos for long-term stability?
Let me deal with this my way.
If Sampson wins his seat it'll change everything.
They have to be seen to destroy themselves.
Everything else is going to plan.
Where's the fall?
Dealing with Sampson in the way you suggest is not an option.
I'm sorry?
If I float an idea, by definition it IS an option.
You're just telling me you think it's a bad one.
I'm telling you it's not the best one.
OK.
But mess this up and you're on your own.
Could I have that in writing?
There have been further violent clashes in response to the death of Melanie Roberts.
News is coming in from Cardiff of an Iraqi man who has been beaten to death by a furious crowd.
The victim, who'd been tortured in the jails of Saddam Hussein, was married with children...
Tell that to the family of Melanie Roberts.
The police expressed concern at the cycle of revenge attacks and are asking for calm.
You're watching Sky News...
Let's go.
Where to?
Come on.
We're not missing out on this.
We're going hunting.
Thought we were avoiding violence during the election.
We got a surprise pass for the weekend.
What you doing?
What?
Boss, he's trying to use his mobile.
So?
Thought you might like a photo for a souvenir.
Shut up, Brian.
Let me do it.
What?
Let me.
No, another time.
Come on, for all those years I spent inside.
No.
Wait!
They killed one of our kids.
Let's do one of theirs.
What, you haven't got the bottle?
Have you?
Come on, hurry up, we're exposed here.
Shit!
What did you do that for?
What?
You moved.
No, I never.
Give me another bolt!
Never mind.
You winged the guy.
Forget the kid, let's move it.
And you introduce me to that cousin of yours, or so help me I'll go and find her myself.
I think, given the choice, most people would prefer a crossbow bolt in the leg to their head.
But couldn't you...
Missed them altogether?
I saved his life.
If my cover gets blown now we lose this op and people will die.
OK, what do you want me to do?
It's time for the cousin.
She can be so outraged by the death of the child that she's decided to come forward.
Fiona must bait the trap now.
Their donation's secure. £500, 000.
Excellent.
There is a condition.
Which is?
Several of us want Moran and his men out of the party.
Too many negative associations.
Yes, but Moran is part of the old guard, he commands huge support.
Very difficult to remove.
Some MPs are still undecided.
Make Perry your number two.
Well... give me time.
Might be better to do it after the election.
We can't alienate the rank and file when there's canvassing to be done.
Well, he has a point.
Moran's men may be a bunch of inbreds but somebody has to slog around those god-awful council estates.
But you can give me your word that after the by-election you'll expel Moran and his supporters and make Perry your deputy?
It's a done deal.
We have to admit that it is impeccable timing.
What is?
Well, asylum seeker murders photogenic little white girl...
Come on, don't tell me you didn't raise a small cheer inside.
Let's take a look at the latest polls, shall we?
Nice here.
Well, nowhere's safe.
Just look at that poor little girl.
But Cheltenham's not like London.
Don't get your handbag stolen by drug addicts.
You mean niggers.
I don't like that kind of language.
If you're going to talk like that I'm not speaking to you any more.
Lesley...
No, Luke,
I've said this to you before.
Not all coloured people are bad.
Then what are you doing here?
I thought you agreed with us.
I support the British Way because we're only a little island and we can't take any more immigrants.
I'm not a racialist though and I, I don't like bad language.
Oh, Les, we've come all this way.
Your mum was really pleased.
And look, I got some photos of when we done a barbecue.
Look.
Henry and Gavin arguing over the barbeque as usual!
Luke says that you work for the Government?
That they passed you over for promotion in favour of a...
I just want what's fair, that's all.
That Asian girl had only worked there a few months.
I've been there 15 years, not a day off sick.
Well, once, when I'd got back from Minorca and I'd eaten a big paella the night before getting on the plane.
Sick!
I should have had the bloody omelette.
My husband John had the omelette and he was fine.
Tell him what you've been working on, Les.
OK, well... my section has been tasked...
That's what we call it in my line of work...to monitor certain organisations.
The British Way is one of them.
Now we listen to traffic, speaking all technical again!
Erm, not like cars and stuff but, erm, exchanges of information between people.
Phone calls, e-mails...
They've been listening to Sampson.
So?
These...
Erm, these, these are transcripts of his conversations with an MP called Peregrine Howell-Davis and some lobbyist.
Transcripts?
And I have a tape.
I don't know, Luke.
I...
This could get me the sack.
You can trust Keith.
You have to get rid of it afterwards.
It's fine, I'll look after it.
Come on, let's get going.
I don't want to get her into trouble.
Don't forget your photos.
TAPE:
Their donation's secure, £500, 000.
Excellent.
There is a condition.
Which is?
Several of us want Moran and his men out of the party.
Too many negative associations.
Moran is part of the old guard and commands huge support, very difficult to remove.
Some MPs are still undecided.
Make Perry your number two.
Well, give me time.
It would be better to do it after the election.
We can't alienate the rank and file when there's canvassing to do.
Well, he has a point.
Moran's men may be a bunch of inbreds but somebody has to slog around those god-awful council estates.
But you can give me your word that after the by-election you will expel Moran and his supporters and make Perry your deputy?
It's a done deal.
It's always the same, isn't it?
What is?
My granddad was injured at the Battle of Ypres.
Dad died of asbestosis.
We're just nothing really, are we?
White trash, bunch of inbreds for everybody to laugh at.
We can take the party back from him.
You'll be our leader.
We don't need some MP taking cheques from big businesses to sell us out.
Let's see how Sampson copes without a shower on his big day.
Harry.
Sampson's holding a press conference today and if what I'm hearing is correct, you'd better be right on top of your game or there'll be consequences.
Fiona, we ready?
The tanks are rolling.
Did you have a shower this morning?
No bloody water in my house.
That car alarm again, if I find the owner...
Where's Perry?
He'll be along shortly with the rest.
You nervous?
Nervous!
No, no, no.
I'll tell you what is amazing.
When people write the history books, this day will go down as a turning point in British politics and we were here, you and I.
Excited.
Good.
Use the adrenaline.
Oh, yeah.
MOBILE RINGS
Oh...
Perry.
Great.
OK, thanks.
Yeah, so what's, what's going on?
Perry's assembling the MPs.
They'll file in one by one for maximum effect.
OK.
Neil's wearing an astonishing tie, apparently.
Well, that's Neil for you.
He'd make a very good spokesperson.
Camera-friendly.
We'll see.
You have been fantastic.
Hear that?
What?
Tiny tremors.
The political landscape is shifting.
Let's go.
Good morning!
Morning.
Good morning.
Now, we are, at present, at the beginning of a new era.
And I'd like to dedicate this moment to the memory of Melanie Roberts.
And so, joining me on stage is Peregrine Howell-Davis, my campaign manager.
Bringing with him ten new British Way MPs.
Mr Sampson, where are your fellow MPs?
Are they not prepared to support burning people out of their houses?
REPORTERS SHOUT QUESTIONS
Woah, woah, woah!
No pictures!
Please just wait!
Please, please just wait!
I said no pictures.
Will you stop taking...
No, stop it!
I'm afraid that William Sampson is a delusional and dangerous megalomaniac who exploits violence for his own ends and who has made a number of despicable off-the-record remarks about the poor child murdered in Hull, which do not bear repeating.
There was never any question that either myself or my colleagues would join him.
Frankly, the man is a liar and unfit to hold a seat in parliament.
Stage one's complete.
Well, I, I can't really say any more at this stage until I consult with my colleagues.
I'm not making any comments about the events in Westminster this morning.
My real colleagues are those on the Executive Committee of the party and I look forward to their full support and a victory for common-sense and decency in North Dale Valley.
Is it decent for you to attack disabled children in your election campaign?
I haven't seen the leaflet but those responsible will be disciplined.
We can go on to win this by-election without those cowards and traitors who promised me their support.
But now more than ever, we need...
The only coward and traitor in this room is you.
Expel me?
Expel me?
!
Expel me, you bastard?
I'll break your neck!
You are insane.
We're taking the party back for its members.
I heard what you've been saying about me.
Liar!
You lying bastard!
MOBILE RINGS
HE SIGHS
Yeah?
Mr Sampson, this is the establishment calling.
How do you feel now that we've introduced a little colour to your life?
More problems for William Sampson today, as violence broke out at a British Way meeting.
Police broke up the warring factions as opinion polls showed a dramatic slump in support for the far-right organisation, which has been riven with internal divisions.
A textbook operation.
Squeezed at every level, the party split right down the middle.
Well done.
Polls are showing a drop in support for Sampson.
What's the latest from Adam?
He's helping get the Real British Way started and ensuring it's filled with nutters and informers.
Ruth, I want you to visit Isis again with some more GCHQ files and help him out.
I don't have to see Moran this time?
Probably not, but if necessary I'm sure you could carry it off as well as last time.
What news from Westminster?
Howell-Davis has been promoted to the shadow cabinet.
Nice to see men of principle rewarded( !
)
He's dropping hints about the Honours list.
Not in my lifetime.
You tell him his only honour comes from serving his country.
MOBILE RINGS
What do you want?
We have to talk.
Look I'm coming up so arrange somewhere discreet for us to meet.
Look don't be such a bloody fool, man.
MI5 have been playing us off against each other and we've walked into every trap they've set for us.
You've got balls, I'll give you that.
I could hunt you down, bury you in that copse over there and nobody would be the wiser.
I want to rebuild things.
Rebuild things?
Now, you say that you heard things on tape, that must have been a set-up.
Don't you lie to me!
They said you were racist scum we should get rid of.
Now has anybody appeared suddenly telling you bad things about me?
We should stay together.
Let's put the party back on the road.
Stay together?
With you?
No, what's done is done.
The party will never be safe with men like you.
But if what you're saying is true, somebody's gonna pay.
DOORBELL RINGS
Ah, yes?
We've come on behalf of your nephew, Luke Chivers.
Oh, yes.
Is anything the matter?
Everything's fine.
Can, er, we come in?
Certainly.
What can I do for you young men?
Luke was wondering if he could, er, have a Twix for his next birthday.
Would you like tea?
Umm, three sugars please.
Who's Luke Chivers?
Adam, it's Ruth.
I'm outside the Isis safe house but there's no answer and the door's ajar.
Are there tulips in the window?
Yes.
OK, wait for me, I'll be there in ten minutes.
Why have they let us go?
They haven't let us go.
Then why...
Adam?
Quick, run!
Go on, run, I've got all day and I know this place like the back of my hand.
We're trapped here.
Adam, he's going to kill us.
He wants me more than you, get out.
I can't leave you.
I'll hold him up.
Go!
Go.
You're losing your touch.
You got time to reload?
Bye-bye, traitor.
I can offer you a deal.
I'm not like you, I have beliefs.
I don't do deals.
I've given my life to this party, for my people.
Your people?
Yes, my people.
Every soldier in a foreign graveyard, every worker whose job's been taken by a foreigner, every man or woman who loves the country that shits on them over and over again.
A crossbow bolt would be preferable to a lecture on patriotism from a murderer like you.
Then I am happy to oblige.
Shall I hit him again, Adam?
Only if you want to.
You're front-page news.
Cheer up, that'll definitely have just lost Sampson his deposit.
I've given my life for this movement.
Yes, you have.
But how hard did we have to push to make Sampson offer you up?
Doesn't that make you wonder about the movement?
I'm not like Sampson and I'm not a traitor like you.
No, you're not.
There's always a reckoning, though.
What?
You're like the SS officer who treats his own children with love and then smacks the legs of Jewish kids with the truncheon as he herds them onto cattle trucks.
I look after my own.
I'll tell that to the grandchildren of my colleague that you drowned.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You can't pin that on me.
You'd have to give evidence, reveal that she was a spy.
You're right.
But you did mention the body of an infiltrator.
The police are there now, they'll probably want DNA samples from you when we're finished.
Pretty straightforward murder case, I would have thought.
Under police escort, the first families are beginning to return to the very homes they were driven from earlier this month.
But it might yet take some time for the wounds of that violent evening to heal.
It'll help that the British Way don't have an MP.
There are concerns now about the disillusionment from the electorate towards politicians.
The way this election has been fought has now raised serious questions about the political landscape of contemporary Britain.
Yes, Sampson losing his deposit really was very satisfactory.
Still...
What?
The turnout was very low and a pantomime horse did better than some of the main candidates.
It doesn't make people fascists to want decent housing for their children.
Ignore their concerns and people like Sampson won't be away for very long.
Glad to have you back.
He'll come.
For what purpose?
To lead a major terrorist attack.
You're thinking of going after Yazdi.
Am I?
Don't.
I don't want any trouble, do you understand?
I can't offer you words of comfort, we both know how dangerous this is.
Get him out of there!

When the machines take control, they...
Thank you very much indeed

Miss Ann put me in the corner and told me not to wear this ever again

I'm going to work
Dad told me, come with uncle Sherif coz we're having lunch at work
- That's all he said?
- Yes
- You haven't said a word all the way
- You too
Uncle Sherif, I wanna go back to my homeland
- This is your home too
- No, my home is where I was born
I wanna go to Palestine, my homeland
You were just born there and came here as a small baby
You've only seen your homeland on TV
You can come back when all conflicts are settled
We've had enough with their resolutions
- 242, 538
- There are indeed plenty channels
I've got around 700 channel on the satellite TV
Have you heard the latest statements of Kofi Anan?
Who's Anan?
- You seem from outer space, man
- I don't get involved in politics
Don't mess with my head
Javier Solana said the problem can't be solved
- Who is this?
- Javier Solana
Yeah, he's a football player in Real Madrid team, rigth?
Javier Solana is a Real Madrid football player?
- You're unbelievable, man
- Cut it out.
I've got enough worries already
You're putting me to the test or what?
What the hell do you want from me?
- I wanna take part in the Intifada?
- What are you sayng, lad?
You're leading a great life here with your dad going to the best school in the country and you wanna go back there?
There's nothing useful there
I want you to speak with him, he listens to you
You remind me of your dad when we both were at the architecture faculty in Egypt
We was just like you but then he got caught up with life and earning a living
What about you uncle Sherif?
You've been living out of Egypt for how long?
I don't quite remember around 22 to 25 years
How could you spend all this time far from your homeland?
Listen Iyad, I have no parents no brothers, no sisters no devilish son like you to take care of
- Didn't you have any friends?
- Sure I did when we first arrived here, we stayed in touch, writing to each other
Soon the letters became much lesser until I completely lost contact with them
- What it is?
- You're always unavailable, man
Get in, he's waiting for you
Don't you know what does he want from me?
- Go on in
- God help me
- Good evening boss
- Good evening Sherif, have a seat
- How are you sir?
- I'm fine, thank you
- Sherif
- Yes sir
I appreciate the great effort you're deploying in my country
- My effort?

Thank you sir, thank you
- Let's have some Champaign Sherif
- Champaign yes
Oh champaign
Oh shit
- Easy, easy, easy
- Oh God
Oh God
We must preserve all family links
- I got sacked
- We've found plenty of jobs to do never mind, man
It's not like I raped her it wasn't against her will
That's what she wanted
No, I'm going back to Egypt
I have a flat there that's been unoccupied for 20 years
Yeah, what are you saying?
What?
Fine, say hello to Iyad
- I'm gonna miss that little devil, take care
- Uncle Sherif, uncle Sherif
Holy shit, what brought you'here?
- I came to bid you farewell
- I'm gonna miss you like hell, lad why don't you leave your dad here and come with me?
- You're so lucky?
- Lucky that I got sacked and am going back home to earn a living?
But you're going back to your home country

Yes sir
What would he bring with him if he'd been to France?
You can get you luggage, Mr. Sherif
Here you go sir, here you go here you go, here you go
- Come on in Mr. Sherif
- Take me straight home
- What is it?
- Who knows sir?
Open it
Take care sir
Welcome, welcome Mr. Sherif
We're so glad to see you
- What is it?
Is anything wrong?
- Capitain Tarek El Abbassy
I'm keeping watch over the region here, sir
- What for?
- Well you know there are lots of eminent personalities living here
With all the public uprisings going on...
students, University, demonstrations
We don't want them to cause us any trouble
I'm afraid I didn't get your point
I've got lots of visits from close friends
- I don't want any scandals, you know?
- Of course not sir
We'll take good care of your visitors
I'm having some visitors late at night from Sigapore
- Where from sir?
- Singapore
- A Singaporean friend
- No problem sir
Can you give us her personal data to issue an entry permit for her?
- A permit to enter my house?
- It's just a simple formality sir
Yeah, her name is Oshin she's got some narrow eyes
Oshin, with narrow eyes
- What's her full name sir?
- Oshin Shokuku Oshushu
Oshin Shokuku Oshushu
- What's the aim of her visit?
- Excuse me?
What the aim of her visit?
Strengthening the Egyptian-Singaporean relations
- Her address in Singapore?
- Behind the gas station
You're gonna carry on a similar investigation for each of my visitors?
Excuse us sir it's only to keep us informed, you may go on sir
Why is this building so quiet?
I don't hear any noise
Who are you supposed to protect?
Yeah, that's the reason
- Good morning
- Good morning ambassador
Israeli Embassy
Let him come in
Wait until I find a way out of this deep shit I'm in
It's a complete disater
I came all the way here to get some rest in my flat
Only to find such trouble makers living next door?
I've got enough to worry about
What if somebody tried to get rid of them or something?
And I'm living right next door what would I get from that?
You're with me or what?
- What's wrong with you Mr. Sherif?
- Mr. Sherif?
Everybody knows my name around here?
Calm down Mr. Sherif
I Know it was a big surprise but think straight and keep it cool
What's wrong with that?
They are just your neighbors
What neighbors?
They're Israelis, Israelis
- What the hell are you?
- It's the headquarters of the Israeli embassy
I know, that's why everybody left this building
Everybody left in a haste
- Why are you still living here?
- Where would I go?
- I would never leave
- Listen
Since you're the only resident that didn't flee we can watch each other's back we shall have not even speak with these people nothing but Good mornings no relation whatsoever with the neighbor
Even better if we don't tell them, good mornng
Who do I have the pleasure to speak with?
David Kohin, the Israeli ambasssador
I know it's a surprise Mr. Sherif
But you must know that you're gonna live in total peace here
And in this building, you'll be much safer than any other palce in the country
Mr. Sherif, we'll carry your luggage right away
Excuse us, the guys were havign lunch
Don't bring down my luggage I'll be leaving soon
- Why?
What's wrong Mr. Sherif?
- Do as I'm telling you
Don't even move my luggage
It's very good
I've been working on a drug dealer case give me something to calm my nerves
If you're that competent
You wouldn't have been working on my alimony for 7 years new
My wife stripped me of every penny I had
If we were still married it would have been less costly
Marriage is an unsuccessful social system
It requires a revolution like the July revolution
The main problem consists of the society it's a completely corrupted society
Tell him to can it, Hussein we don't want any other principles tonight
What's wrong?
What are you afraid of?
Who dares to knock on the door of Helmy the lawyer
I'd deal with them whoever they are
Yes?
- Sherif Khayry?
- Hey Darsh, how are you doing Mostafa?
- How are you doing Sherif?
- Hussein
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing pal?
Fine, thank you
- It seems he didn't recognize me
- I'm either high or very much awaken
- Come on in, come on in
- Zakaria
You buggers, when I left you 25 years ago, you were sitting just like now
I came back after all the time to see that nothing actually changed
Give my man Sherif Khayry the best hookah
What a bunch of hookahs!
You're having a hookah uprising, right?
Long time no see, Sherif
Tell us, we were told that you were leading a great life in the Emirates
- What brought you back?
- Val?
- Who's Val?
- The manager's wife
- You got caught with her?
- No, not quite so
He caught something with me that belongs to her
- What about you Hussein?
- Still the same
I'm a veterinary in the Ministry of Agriculture
- I'm divorced and quite penniless
- You deserve it you shouldn't have gotten married, man
- What about you Darsh?
- I'm a journalist in "No Newspaper"
It's a newspaper that finds fault with everything
- What bout you Sherif?
- I found myself in a terrible disaster
- Since I came here
- A terrible disaster?
It seems like a good case to work on, spit it out, spit it out
- An embassy in the building
- What?
An embassy in the building and the ambassador in the elevator
Take it easy on him Mustafa he's already had enough
You think I'm high?
I'm telling you the embassy is in my building, right next door
- What embassy?
- Of Israel
- What?
- Israel
You're living next to the Israeli embassy and you've got the balls to say it?
- How coul you say it?
- The last thing I need now is you, Mustafa
I don't know how to live in this building
On my way in I got thorughly questioned
Where from and where to?
And on my way out I find a special task force
I don't even dare to get into the bathroom lest I should find somebody in there
- What are you gonna do about it, Sherif?
- I'm too scared to sleep in that flat
I don't know what to do why don't you get rid of it, try to sell it
- I would love to, get me a customer
- Piece of cake
There's a broker from Dumyat who's ready to buy any property on the Nile
You'd better give him a cheap price to sell it
- And buy a nice flat next to us
- No problem
Hello
Oshin, how are you?
Where are you calling from?
Which hotel?
Stay right there, I'm coming it'll be a warm night
- You'd sell your friends so cheap?
- No nagging
I'm so sorry sir, you can't get up, it's forbidden
Forbidden?
I have an appointment with her
It's the hotel's regulations
What regulations?
Each hotel will make his own regulations?
- Why are you shouting sir?
- What's the problem?
No problem, hello Oshin
Where to sir?
You gave me your flat address, right?
Why don't we go there?
I have only 3 hours left
That's a good idea, go straight to the zoo
Where did they go?
Nobody here, that's good
- What the hell is going on here?
- A goal for Egypt
- Who's the other team?
- I don't know
Mr. Sherif
- Yes
- It's about Singapore
I'm going home, to my own flat there's no rule whatsoever that forbids me to receive visitors
- It's a question of personal freedom
- I totally agree
- But it's just a matter of procedures
- I already told you she's coming
- That's right sir, her permit is ready
- Good
When you left and told us not to take up the luggage
- We canceled the permit
- What are you talking about?
- We're going up whatever you say
- Listen Mr. Sherif you can take her to the coast road
Eat some corns, lupine and potatoes
Until the permit is ready
What potatoes man?
She's not here to have some potatoes
Her plane leaves in two hours
- We don't have any time to waste
- One second
Yes sir, Mr. Sherif is here with a Singaporean girl
- What's wrong?
- No problem
What's your orders sir?
Roger that sir
Can she leave her passport here?
- Leave your passport here, Oshin
- Okay
Can you send us some underwear and my pajama from my bags?
No, these bags must remain here for safety procedures
I'll send them with the luggage later on
My passport please
Thank you
I'm so tired of working here sir I wanna be transfered to tourist police
No knives, no forks, no spoons where are the cutlery of this house?
- Hello
- Is this the baker El Do'i?
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Sure sir
I would like to have a shrimp and meat pie
- You want 2 pies?
- No, just one pie with both ingredients
- I'd like some roe on it, please
- Right away sir
- What's the address sir?
- 14 A, Demaly street
Yes, the Israeli embassy building
So sorry sir, your order is unavailable right now
- What is it guys?
I'm going out
- It's forbidden
- You can't get out before 5 o'clock
- What do you mean?
I'm a prisoner in my own house?
I'm getting out right now
You can't, there's a meeting in the Embassy, it's a state of emergency
I don't give a shit about the embassy and its meetings
- I'm getting out, you can try to stop me
- Sir, don't make me do it the hard way
You're gonna hit me?
I'm getting gout right now
You can't, our job is to protect you too
I don't need your protection and I'm getting out
What's wrong Mr. Sherif?
I don't know why you're so high-strung?
How could you insult the safety guards?
They're here to protect you it's a normal situation
How can you call this a normal situation, Mr. Rashed?
I can't eat, nor drink nor take a bath, nor even sleep
I'm forbidden to get out and in as I please
I can't live like this
Listen Mr. Sherif, you've barely spent a day in your flat
Eventually you'll get to know them better and vice versa
What do you mean sir?
What you said to the ambassador in the elevator is totally unacceptable
I thought you were much more broad-minded
You were irritated and used some insulting expressions
To hell with them, damn day and something like it
Listen Sherif, we signed a peace treaty with these people
We have some diplomatic relations with them
This is your country's policy
Although some people or most of them think differently
This is the Nation's Supreme Interest
Would you like to go against the Nation's Supreme Interest?
No sir, I'm not against the Nation's Supreme Interest
But you must not act against my own inferior interest
Egypt is our beloved country, Sherif
It's the biggest country in the region
Being big is a huge problem
You have to take all your behaviors into consideration
We were destined to go to war and that's what we did
We liberated Sinai and took back Thebes
And we imposed the peace process
I'm not asking you to give them a warm welcome hug
I received a note saying that you frowned at the Israeli ambassador
Which made him in poor spirits all day long
We don't wanna receive any more complaints
Mind your own business Sherif
Live your life and try to adapt yourself to the current situation
If you need anything, give me a call
Sir, I have lots of friends
And sometimes, they pass by to spend a couple of nights with me
This terrible state I'm in will only make them turn tail
For instance, I have a respected dear friend from Singapore
Oshin
Don't you trouble yourself
You just lead a normal life
Whatever you need, just give me a call and I'll come to you in a flash
How could you remain silent?
Why didn't you say anything man?
What happened to the cause, Sherif?
How could you?
What happened to your principles, to your dignity?
- You tell him, when I gouge your eyes out
- You wanna gouge my eyes out?
Let me continue
When I gouge your eyes out and replace them with two gems would you see?
These things are not negotiable, you tell him that
You want me to tell the officer I'll gouge your eyes out?
You wanna put me in a fix or what?
Just keep silent and let's see how to get rid of this flat
Fine, fine, the guy is on his way here
We made a deal and he's coming with a down payment
- Nice
- What have we done, guys?
Sherif is out but another one is living in his flat
This is totally wrong, man
This must be him
Where to?
You stay here or else you'll screw it all
We don't wanna gouge anybody's eyes out
- Good evening
- Good evening Hajji Sayed, come on in this is Mr. Sherif Khayry my oldest and best friend this is Hajji Sayed El Domyati the most eminent dignitary in Dumyat come on in, you're most welcome brought you to my house coz there's no need to go to the office
- It's just a favor for my closest dear friend
- We're all friends here, Mr. Rateb
- Tell me, how big is this flat?
- It's a 300 meter flat here's is the contract, it's registered too 300 meter all in all with skylights and balconies
I gave you the contract check it out for yourself
- How much do you want for it?
- We already told hajji
We want one and half for it
Mr. Rateb, that's what you said on the phone
I'm gonna pay for it in cash you'd better give me a better price
Well said, hajji
This is the man who's gonna live there and make their lives a living hell
Where's this flat located?
- It's four blocks away
- Four blocks?
I know this place very well
- I bought a shop in there
- The building with the other dwellers
What other dwellers?
- The Embassy, the Embassy
- The Israeli Embassy
- What's wrong, hajji?
- It's not even worth a penny, see you later
Yes Abu Iyad, do me a favor I wanna go back to work
I'll do my best, Sherif
Iyad sends you a kiss
Hello, how are you doing uncle Sherif?
- Hi Iyad, how are you?
- I miss you, I love you very much
I miss you too, you're still thinking about leaving the Emirates?
Don't go anywhere, I'm coming back
See you later
Mr. Sherif
You're all alone today
- You brought nothing with you?
- Something like what?
Something made in Taiwan Thailand or something
Hello, yes Mr. Rashed
This is too much, it's really too much
Fine sir
Thank you very much, see you later
- Hello
- Hello
This is the El Do'i bakery sir
I'm gonna send you a delicious shrimp and lobster pie garnished with pineapple
No, thanks man, I'll call you if I'd like to have anything
A 3 meter table, with plenty dishes of all shapes and colors
Turkeys, shrimps, and pigeons
- Where can we find this table?
In a dream?
- No, in my flat
- Actually, it's my birthday
- No kidding
I hate to celebrate it and blow the candles all alone
- Ain't a pity?
- Stop, I beg you, I'm on the verge of tears
The flat is not far from here
Stop beating around the bush what system do you follow?
Whatever you like
- 500 pounds
- How much?
- 500 pounds
- I left Egypt for too long
Things have gone bonkers in this country
The last time I was here it was only for 5 pounds
Knock it off man just take it or leave it
I don't have Egyptian currency do you take dirhams?
- Fine then, it's 500 dirhams
- That means 1000 pounds
What's the big deal?
It's your birthday, isn't it?
Don't drive such a hard bargain I'm a customer, a consumer
Let me but a season ticket and I'll pay you every 3 months
Let's go baby
Why is this building so tightly secured?
You're a minister or what?
- They proposed to me but I refused
- Much better
Good evening sir
- Good evening Mr. Tarek
- Go on sir
- You don't want her passport
- Of course not
Your visitors are welcome any time
- She's spending the night over?
- Yes
- Singaporean too?
- No, national
I like to encourage the national industry
I wanna be transfered to Vice Squad sir
- A rocket
- You're overreacting
Why?
What is it?
- Who's this?
- What's your status?
The embassy had been bombed with a rocket that mistakenly hit Mr. Sherif's flat, sir
- He's hurt?
- No, he's okay sir
He's very strong with nerves of steel
It made a 1.15 m hole in the wall
- How come?
- No, the rocket, not Mr. Sherif
- Which embassy?
- The Israeli embassy
- You're living next to the Israeli embassy?
- Yes
Yes, yes, and why the hell haven't you told me about that, you filthy traitor?
How could you bring me next to the Israeli embassy, you scumbag
Shame on you
Here you go, here you go you can have your money back
You don't even deserve to be an Egyptian citizen
You're gonna pay for it you traitor
Dear lord, help me
She got so patriotic all of a sudden, started to insult me and threw the money in my face
Look Sherif, although she's a prostitute, she has her own principles
After all, she refused what you agreed to do
Where the hell do you want me to go?
You won't go anywhere Sherif
You'll remain in your flat and I'll throw them out
You wanna throw them out?
I hired him to throw my wife out but she eventually kicked me out
How will you throw them out?
Via the right of common consent with the neighbor
What right?
The right of common consent with the neighbor you're physically and morally damaged from your neighbors
This rocket is a tangible proof
I can file a lawsuit and I'm convinced that I'll win most importantly, we must go shoot your wrecked flat and enclose the photos with the file, okay?
Shoot everything and show what happened these chairs were flying all around the place the tables were all wrecked everything was turned upside down
All glass went shattering everything was wrecked
It was like an 8 Richter earthquake
The rocket made this huge hole here
They broke into my flat while I was in the bedroom with the chick
It was a big hole
- What is it?
Whose flat is this?
- What hole?
Where's the hole?
You're having visions, man?
Where's the rocket you're talking about?
What visions?
This flat was a total wreck
That's okay Sherif, you'd better keep yourself warm at night from now no
What are you talking about, man?
I haven't gone bonkers yet the chick that was with me saw it all
- What are you shooting?
- The rockets
Yes Mr. Rashed?
It's you
When did you have the time to clean up the palce?
Thank you so much sir, see you later
The government cleaned the place up they removed the assault's tracks
Enough with embassies and rockets
- Let's have a drink
- I'm ready
- Let's continue
- Very nice
- I'd like to have some tea, Sherif
- Tea?

We have enough
- Everything's fine, sir?
- What?
- Everything's fine?

Have a nice night
How could you leave such a nice flat on the Nile, Sherif?
You have government officials as your own servants
Can it, man
What?
Who the hell do you think I am, a stupid student?
Just keep your mouth shut, they record everything we say on tapes
I don't fear them
I hate Israel and I'm not scared to say it before the whole world
I'm against the Israeli the Israeli slogans
Enough with your shiny principles, man
Via the law, we'll claim our rights via the law
What law man?
This world knows no laws did this law of yours get me what my divorced wife took from me
I'm not having fun anymore get the hell out of here, get out
Until when we'll keep our voice down, scard to reveal our opinions?
We must wake up, guys
Wake up, we're not getting high to wake up, are we?
You're right, you're absolutely right
I wanna forget it all
It's been 2 years, Sherif
I haven't seen my kids for 2 years
You're gonna see them
Yes sir no, everything's just fine
I have another favor to ask you no, I don't want some Nescafe it's a totally different thing

I don't care if I got killed
I don't care if I got killed
I don't care if I got killed or even got thrown in jail
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against normalization
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against normalization
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against normalization

We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against normalization
We won't give up, not at all
Where the hell are you going, man?
I'm just going home to take a warm bath and freshen up a bit
What are you saying, man?
Put me down, put me down
- Where are you going?
- I wanna go back to the demonstration
It's not like they'll get lost without you, come back here
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against normalization
Have a drink
What has a sweet beautiful girl like you to do with a bunch of street rats?
- Thank you so much
- You're welcome
I still don't know your name
Dhalia Shuhdy from the Left Progressive Movement
- Sherif Khayry from Gizah
- Nice meeting you
What do you do for a living?
I'm a professor in the faculty of political and economical science
I'm a petroleum engineer pleased to meet you
Pleased to meet me?
It's the worst day in the Egyptian history, Mr.
- And you're pleased?
- I'm terribly annoyed this is the worst day of life, having just met you
Come here, where to?
Why is it the worst day in Egyptian history?
- What happened?
- You're asking me?
You don't know what happened?
Will you take it easy and tell me what happened?
- The Israeli ambassador
- David?
What has he done this time?
He and the commercial attaché, signed the commercial convention with us it's a forced normalization
- What's this word you just used?
- Normalization
- What does it mean?
- What is it that you don't understand?
What does the forced normalization mean?
I'm sorry
This normalization is a great thing
I'm so sorry, but the officers were gonna arrest me
- What?
- I thought he's... nothing at all
- When can I see you again?
- Late at night 8 o'clock in front of Group, see you
This is the right thing to do
- Let's go
- Where to?
Let me worry about that
- Leave it all to me
- I'm all yours
- This is an insult for all nations
- What's this?
- Where are we?
- Just come with me
It's not just an insult, it's a disgrace
It's a euphemism to call what's going on in the entire region an insult
Even if we call it a disgrace, we can't fully express what's happened to us
This is called contempt
We won't accept any underestimation of our sufferings
It's a degradation a degradation, a degradation
We won't give up we won't sell our land we're against normalization
We won't give up we won't sell our land we're against normalization
We're gonna stick to our stance whatever happens
We're against this situation
Despite their enticements and their threats
The struggling flame will remain ablaze whthin each one of us
They won't muzzle our mouths
We will keep on saying it overtly
Sign as much conventions as you like
Defile our lands as much as you like
But our heads will always remain high
You can't stain our blood
We...
We must boycott this goods totally and completely
I hate Israel and admits it before the whole world
I don't care if I got killed or even got thrown in jail
- I hate Israel
- And admits it before the whole world
- I don't care if I got killed
- Or even got thrown in jail

- It doesn't matter
You fix a price and we'll pay it

- How big is it?
- It's a 300 meter flat
- All in all with skylights and balconies?
You know Hajji Sayed?
- Anyway?
It won't be a problem?
- Sure it will
This flat used to be my parents'
To you, its value is measured in meters
To me, it's measured in past memories if I sold, it'll be a disgrace, a shame it'll be a degradation and contempt
Welcome Mr. Sherif
It's the wrong beginning spare me the formalities
- I could change my mind and leave
- Come on in, Sherif
Everybody, this is Sherif Khayry

Why don't you sit here?
It's much more comfortable
- Have a seat
- Have a seat
Wow, you've get endless rows of books here
I see books everywhere it's nice to be well-educated
- What book are you reading?
- Love in Cholera times
- In cholera times
- By Gabriel Garcia Marquis
I read lots of books dealing with energy and geology back in the nick
It was an opportunity to get acquainted with this world
- You were int the nick?
- I spent half my life in the nick
It was an opportunity to get acquainted with this world
- You were in the nick?
- I spent half my life in the nick
Surely you wife took on the responsibility when you were in the nick
- I was in jail too
- This whole family has done time
You were in jail too or were you raised in an orphanange?
I raised my kids to act upon their own beliefs
We were born to object quoting from Maxim Gorgy
Soda or water
I'm afraid to choose or else you might object
- You're the spitting image of your father?
- My father?
- This is Carl Marx
- Dhalia loves Guevara
And Nader loves Marx
Dhalia loves Guevara and Nader loves Marx
I love the national militant Shaaban Abd Elrehim
You're right Mr. Sherif
We're facing a cultural degradation
Our society is been with an intellectual trance
I can't let you serve it yourself
We're a socialist house we help each other
- You're most welcome
- Thank you sir
I don't think I had the pleasure
This is the comrade nanny Um Attiyat, the maid
The maid?
The comrade nanny Um Attiyat was with me in the nick
For defending the same cause she got out before me and raised my kids
The comrade nanny Um Attiyat is self-educated
She's an expert in Russian literature
A living pattern of the Proletariat
My dad was a worker and my mom was a worker
They both died in the Workers' demonstration
- Organized by the communist party
- Frankly, I take pride in knowing all of you
But I'd like to say something
We went through
After going through the government went down
Thus the people went down too but some weren't affected
Both kinds of people lived in a some kind of frustration
When... will you put your leg away, you're killing me
It stinks man, that's unbearable
Your leg has long been dead I'm sure you can't feel it anymore
I guess I have the right to object on this rotten leg
I've always told him so
You're always been in jail, when did you have the time to tell him?
- Is Dhalia Shuhdy here?
- How can I help you?
- What is it?
- Where is Dhalia Shuhdy?
I'm Dhalia Shuhdy
- We have an arrest warrant against you
- Would you show it to me first?
- What warrant?
She's accused of what?
- None of your business
- I'll pack your bag, Dhalia
- And I'll ask the Party to get you a lawyer
- Come with us
- It's not right to trat her like this
- She's an educated person
- I'm so sorry Sherif
- I wanted to stay with you
- Come with me
Have a seat Mr. Sherif let's go on with the conversation
What were we saying?
Aren't you gonna pack her bag?
There will be investigations as well as the public prosecution first
- Pour me a glass, Shuhdy
- Me too Dr. Shuhdy
Just because you're attracted to a beautiful lady
Doesn't give you the right to take part in demonstrations
And attend meetings and give speeches
What's going on Sherif?
We already met here and came to an agreement, didn't we?
What happened?
Mr. Rashed, I want Dhalia out of the nick
You fell for her so fast?
What has she done to be arrested like this?
Sherif Khayry is showing interest in politics
I'm not involved whatsoever in politics
I did everything you asked and this is my only demand
Fine the Sherif very well, she'll be released
But you'd better tell her to seize her activities completely
You know Sherif?
If only everybody would mind his own business just like you
This country would be just fine
I'll tell her, I'll tell her that Rashid
I didn't wanna bother you, Sherif
But you've arisen my suspicions I'm starting to think you're a cop
I'm no cop, that's for sure
- Can we go some place to talk?
- Of course
I want you to eat to your heart's content
You haven't eaten anything since you got arrested
Dhalia, why don't you seize these political activities of yours?
You're a beautiful girl
You could save yourself all this trouble any guy would die to win your heart
Why don't you get married have a boyfriend?
- Live your life
- This is the life I choose, Sherif
I already had one marriage experience, we have to get a divorce
- Whe did you get divorced?
- Coz he was a cheater
That's typical to all men, they're scumbags, not trustworthy at all
- You caught him with another woman?
- If only
Then you caught him with a man?
If only
- Then how did you know he's a cheater
- He lied to me
- You know who was his aunt's husband?
- Who?
Menahem Begin?
He has a tourism agency
I found out he enterd groups of Israelis in the country
That filthy traitor
But sometimes, due to certain circumstances
We found ourselves forced to accept a situation that we're not satisfied with
What circumstances?
No circumstances would force a man to give away his principles
Yeah but...
Well, in my case for instance I came from the Emirates
And found myself living next door to the Israeli Embassy
- What?
- They moved to live there
- I already had that flat
- You're living next to the embassy?
Right next door?
You see them and they see you
Each and every morning you say hello to each other
So that's it
Now I knew why I got released so quickly
You're a spy and a traitor
- Wait, let me explain
- Let go off my hand
I don't ever wanna see you again
What?
This is not the case of Sherif Khayry
It's the case of the whole nation
Your honor, based on the regulation of mutual consent with the neighbor
Every citizen has the right to live happily in his own house
And Sherif Khayry is a good citizen
He spent his whole life in the Gulf
Working hard, and toiling
Saving each dirham he earns
To come back to his homeland and take some time off
And lead a happy life
Only to find what?
Only to find himself besieged by the Israeli embassy
He can only get out and into his house on specific times
He can't order food, or even take a bath
What a miserable life is my client leading?
Take a look at Sherif Khayry
You can see how affected he seems
His spirits have sunk
Your honor, allow me to express my opinion
I'm the wronged party, I'm the plaintiff
And I'd like to speak for myself
- You may speak
- Your honor, I don't know what to say
But I know you perfectly get my point
My client was sitting all alone at home
Watchig the 7:15 sitcom just like any other Egyptian citizen
All of a sudden, a rocket blew up in his own house
What kind of safety is this your honor?
I strongly urge you to expel the Israeli embassy
From the flat next to my client's
I also urge you to make up for his losses
With an approximate amount of 5 million dollars
Given the material losses that he incurred
Thank you your honor
What the hell is this Rateb?
You're a non-believer
We're gonna win the case, don't worry I managed to build a solid case
Let the defendant's lawyer approach
Holy shit, all of them are the embassy's lawyers
If each of them just coughed up I'll be sentenced to death
The case that's shook the public opinion, is still in the hands of the court
Sherif Khayry who stood against the Israeli embassy in Cairo
Resorted to the court of justice to claim his stolen right
As you can see behind me there are hundreds of people, who gathered in front of the court of justice to receive Sherif Khayry who became a real role model supported by milions of people
You were with Ahmed El Kasem El Munira TV staion, Cairo
Mr. Sherif, were you somehow scared or reluctant before bringing a lawsuit against the Israeli embassy?
I never had a second thought and I would never ever leave my house whatever happens
Did they really offer to buy your flat?
They offered me milions of dollars in return for my flat but I refused
Yes I refused and shall never change my opinion, nor trade my country
Either me or the embassy in that building
Either me or the embassy in that building
Either me or the embassy in that building
Either me or the embassy in that building
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against normalization
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against adjustments
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against adjustments
We won't give up, we won't sell our land we're against adjustments

Sherif Khayry on the front page?
Who's this Sherif Khayry you're making a fuss about?
Sherif Khayry sir, I knew him 30 years ago
He spent his whole life fighting for his country
I suggest we have an exclusive interview with him
It's him, it's him sir
- Hello
- Yeah Mustafa
Where are you?
Why don't you come on over with Hussein?
We fixed the best hookah ever, it's called Sharon
- Come on over
- I'll be there in a flash
He's a fighter, a strong fighter sir
And Israel and this fake peace she's trying to promote is a pack of lies
This man is a great speaker
Nobody's in a state of war against Israel
- We must take notice of that
- This man is a great speaker
Dot your i's and cross your t's before we move to the roofing
- Dot your i's...
- This woman is a great speaker too
Hand it over
Lieutenant
You're most welcome Mr. Rashed but what's this surprise visit?
- I say you on TV yesterday Sherif
- You heard what a nice speech I gave?
Sure thing, I wonder who taught you to speak so?
- What do you mean Mr. Rashed?
- I want you to make up and concentrate
Don't be fooled by the current events
Don't let the people fool you and make you think you're a real hero
Beware Sherif
Beware not to get carried away with this nonsense
You really brought a lawsuit against the embassy
Which is your legal right
But that doesn't change anything with our agreement
Keep your relation with them within the agreed boundaries
Within the allowed frames, Sherif
Sherif, I'm so sorry I questioned your patriotism before
But we're going through some hard times affecting the entire nation but we must stick together
Coz we our destiny is the same and our goal is mutual
Dhalia we're gonna spend our days and nights talking about this?
Since I met you, I long to be with you, just the two of us
To get close and personal
You're trying to give me a hint about something, Sherif?
I'm not dropping hints
There's more to life than politics and demonstrations
It's a beautiful life and we must enjoy it
For instance, I'm a single solitary man and you're a beautiful lady
Yeah
You want me to go home with you Sherif?
No, no, no
Don't start getting ideas
Today is my birthday and I wanted to be a surprise
I'm so sorry Sherif, happy birthday
I've always celebrated my birthday all alone
And I'd love to celebrate it with you today
It'll be my peasure
Hey man
I'm sorry I broke the sign I was a bit distracted
And why not?
You're Egypt's hero you may break whatever you like
God bless Mr. Sherif to bring disgrace on them
Either me or the embassy in that building
Leave the socialism books in sight I want him to see it as soon as he gets in
- I want these books back, do you hear?
- I said I'll bring them back
I'll use them and bring them back
Come with me, come on
- Give me the other one
- Here you go
This one is...
- Who did you say this was?
- Mao
- Who is it?
- Mao Tse-Tong
Founder of the socialism in China
- What about this one?
- It's Lenin
They used to work together, right?
Lenin is the leader of the Bolshevik revolution
Yes of course, give it to me
Go now coz I'm expecting visitors, go on Mustafa

- Come on in, uncle
- Your uncle is here?

They insisted on celebrating your birthday with us
It's an insult it's a great insult for Egypt to search us in our own country as thoroughly as they did it's a setback Mr. Sherif they stripped us of Mao they stripped us of Mao downstairs
Come on in, come on in
- This is rigorous demagogy
- Yeah
What did he just say?
I think he received a strong blow on the head
Come on in, I'll go get changed and will be right out
What does demagogy mean?
- You're most welcome
- Mr. Sherif
- Yes dear
- This is your birthday gift
- What's this?
- The City of Beasts
Thank you, it's so nice of you
- Where is comrade Um Attiyat?

This is Mr. Unintelligible
- Who is it?
- Unintelligible
I'm Shuhdy Sleiman
We know you very well I'm Mr. Sherif's neighbor
You too?
Why don't you work together and bring a lawsuit against them
- To get rid of them once and for all
- Keep it cool Mr. Shuhdy
I can't file a lawsuit, Mr. Shuhdy
- You're scared or what?
- Don't be afraid, we're all by your side
Knock it off uncle Shuhdy
Mr. Shuhdy, I'm David Kohin the Israeli ambassador
- What's this?
- Holy shit
You want me to sit with an imperialist expansionst?
- You settler
- You ravisher
- Guys, we're members of the same family
- That's the last thing we needed
- Let's go Farida
- Let's go Shuhdy
- Come on
- Let's get out
We're leaving Sherif, you're coming with us or you'd rather stay here?
I'm coming with you of course you're leaving or you wanna spend the night here?
The ambassador came to your house
- And brougth you a cake?
- Yes
- He had lit the candles?
- Yes
And sang happy birthday to you in Arabic?
Yeah
The only explanation is that our position is strong and theirs is very weak
You have the strongest lawyer in the Middle East
It's getting clearer guys
I'm gonna quit celebrating my birthdays
I can't take it anymore
I'm leaving
- Where did it go?
- You lost something?
- It was right here, where did it go?
- Where did what go?
- The blue suit that I wore to come here
- You're wearing it
Yeah right
It's a good thing you told me I was leaving without it
- You want me to take you home?
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'd gouge your eyes out and replace them with two stones
But where would I get these stones from?
- Be careful
- I'm okay
Take it up
- Brother Sherif, the government...
- It's a government of non-believers
It's so corrupted
- So you're with us?
- Of course I am
You're ready to do whatever we ask you to?
I lay my life in you hands I'd do whatever you want
Then you're not scared of the government?
I only fear God
You're full of faith
I believe in God, the one and only and I'm His most loyal servant
- Brother Sherif
- Yes
This is what you've been destined for
To give the biggest favor for the whole Islamic Nation
Of course, of course
What are they strapping me with?
It's the explosive's strap
- What strap?
- The explosive's strap
- Explosive like a bomb?
- We know you have a strong faith we're most sure you won't hesitate to sacrifice yourself for the Whole Islamic nation you'll become a martyr and that's the biggest reward you'll ever get according to God's will
- You don't belong to this place
- Where do I belong?
- Your place is up?
- What do you mean by up?
Up with the martyrs
You'll remain down here
- And I'll go up all by myself?
- Yes
Why don't you go up and I'll wait for you down here?
It's your destiny
This strap will blow up in exactly an hour
- And you know where it must blow up
- Where?
In the whole building
Included the embassy of pigs and monkeys
- I'll be in that building too
- Yes but be careful
If you make any attempt of loosening the strap
Will result in your own death
You'll lose your remuneration
Put your trust in the Lord he's your only aid
- And your reward will be great
- And the reward will be great
- What's wrong, man?
- I won
I want this to be done and over with, within 48 hours
I'm wearing an explosive strap
5 seconds before it blew up, they took it off
I don't know why is this happening to me?
What have I done to deserve this?
Well, you did a lot of awful things, man, here you go
Tomorrow you'll be relieved tomorrow they'll pass the final judgment
They're gonna leave the building we're gonna kick them out
- What is it Mr. Tarek?
- I wanted to see you before leaving
- Where are you going?
- I've been transferred to the New Movement
I'll be working in the Anti-riot division
I sure am gonna miss you Mr. Tarek
Allow me to say you're the most courageous man I've ever known
I'd like to hear from you from time to time
God bless you
If we all love this country as much as you do this country would be the greatest place on earth
Mr. Sherif
Mr. Sherif, Mr. Sherif
God help you
Where to miss?
I live in this building
I've never had the peasure to see such a beauty
- It was locked up
- Why?
Why don't you open it?
- You're Sherif Khayry?
- Yeah, that's me
You turned the whole country upside down
Don't you worry the power has gone off
- Does it go off very often here?
- No
But being the luckiest man on earth, it went off today
The power comes back on in the most unsuitable moment
Why don't we go to my place?
I'll fix a drink to regain your wits
But you must promise me to act like a gentleman
I'll treat you like no man has ever treated a lady before
I'll be a gentleman all night long
What do you think about this gentleman?
So great, right?
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
- This is her husband
- Her husband?
You're most welcome
Don't you point the finger of suspicion at me, or even start getting ideas you have a wonderful wife she jsut had cerain problems I was helping her to solve them get up and leave with your husband, go ahead
why did you make her sad?
she got upset and ended up in bed with another man but I took great care of her she's perfectly amazing
- Yes
- Look Mr. Sherif
- Tell me
- We have everything you did tonight on tape we can reveal it, if you like it this is called adultery you can get 3 year sentence or maybe her husband might lose his mind and kill you right away
What you're saying is very logical
You're a bunch of respectable people but why don't we just keep it to ourselves
I'd do whatever you want
Sometimes, we commit some hideous deeds we're ashamed of
First thing in the morning I want you you to go to the court and drop the case of expelling the embassy from the building
Better remain good friends, right?
There is my client
As you can see, his eyes are red, his clothes are ragged, so tired, with his untidy hair
Is this the same Sherif Khayry who arrived from abroad few weeks ago with rounded cheeks full of hope and joy?
Look at his face
Is this the same Sherif Khayry?
He can't speak your honor, he's speechless
He's a wreck, he's the remnant of a human being
Your honor, I would like to speak
Sherif Khayry the symbol of resistance
Sherif Khayry the symbol of resistance
Either me or the embassy within that building
Either me or the embassy within that building
Your honor, I'm here to drop the case against the embassy
Sherif Khayry is a filthy traitor
Sherif Khayry is a filthy traitor
Sherif Khayry is a filthy traitor
Sherif Khayry is a filthy traitor
The case is closed and the session is adjourned
You sold our case Sherif
You sold it you piece of shit
How much did you take?
Shame on you

Yes, Abu Iyad
Look Abu Iyad
I have nothing left in this country
I'm confined to the house I can't get down on the street
If only I hadn't come here
I'm a stranger in my own country
I wanna go back
Even if I don't get my job back, I wanna go back
Fine Abu Iyad
Yeah?
Who is it?
Wala' Ghanem, how are you doing Wala'?
Where did you get my number?
It must be the guys
Yeah, why I've never seen you with them?
Fine, I'll drop by you tomorrow we'll have lunch together no I'm not busy
Fine Wala'
What are you writing?
You're giving me a parking ticket?
I haven't done anything illegal
Yes I'm giving you a parking ticket
There's an old ticket too is there anything else?
- Sheri
- Wala'
How are you?
You're leading a great life, man
You used to be a poor fellow you're a drug dealer now or what?
You've always been a funny man, Sherif
You've turned this country upside down man you're front page news, man come with me, come over here
What's going on with you?
Since I came from the Emirates I don't get what's happening once I'm a national hero another time I'm a traitor
The same people who held my pictures up high are trampling on me
I'm neither a hero nor a traitor
I'm just Sherif Khayry you know me very well
Yes man, the university's Casanova
Nor this, women don't want me either
- What's all this wealth?
- I worked as a businessman just like you
I worked hard without letting myself be influenced by all the useless monsense
- What are you gonna do?
- I'd like to go back to the Emirates
I'm having a hard time here
Look, you saved some money, right?
Why don't you remain here and we can do business together?
- What kind of business
- That's exactly what I wanna talk about
Come over here, we can have lunch and discuss business issues at the same time
Ambassador I suppose you met Mr. Sherif
We've already met, Wala'
Mr. Sherif is our dearest neighbor
Please have a seat both of you
- You're working with them, Wala'
- Sherif, let's be practical
Until when we'll remain sworn enemies?
Just tell me, what's the use of all these popular slogans?
We won't be fighting them anymore
Better work and build this country
By the way, their agricultural experiment was carrid out successfully
Your experts have done a breakthrough, ambassador
Our fruits do not grow on specific seasons anymore
We can eat water melon in winter and orange in summer
Their experts?
You brought Israeli experts to grow our land?
I wondered why the fruits became so tasteless and odorless
We've been growing our land for 7000 years
And now you brought them to cultivate our own lands?
Mr. Sherif?
We haven't seen you at the reception, I sent you an invitation
- I hate receptions
- I just wanted to ask you a favor, Mr. Sherif
- What favor?
- Frankly, I'm terribly ashamed of myself
The number of guests is much more than I expected
I'm terribly ashamed
- What can I do for you?
- If you don't mind
Can you open your flat's door to receive my guests in your reception room?
Just for an hour
- My guests have no place to sit
- You want them to sit in my flat?
A neighbor in need is a neighbor indeed, right?
I'm sorry, I can't
How can you trun me down?
It's the first time I ask you a favor
I received an interesting video tape but didn't show it to anyone
That's of course because I hold you in high esteem
I see
- You're so lucky?
- Lucky that I got sacked and am going back home to earn a living?
But you're going back to your home country

Here are all the access codes to CTU and Division.
- Thanks.
- I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
Sir, Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.
Tony, thank you for filling in.
And I'd like you to stick around and assist Ms Dessler.
- Who?
- Michelle Dessler.
Do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?
Turns out the man we're looking for works there.
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.
OK.
I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employees, Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, a terrorist responsible for today's attack and theft of the override.
We need you to take your IT systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it.
Print it out, now.
Now!
He's gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb.
We have to use it now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that's electrical gets fried.
I'm gonna try and stop it.
If I don't, take the hard copy, meet me in front of the building.
CTU agent's heading down near you.
Don't let him near it.
Oh, my God.
Are any electronic devices working?
Onlythebasicbattery-powereddevices.
- How many square miles are affected?
- 80, including southeast downtown.
OK.
Hold your position until the readings stabilise.
- Any word from Jack or Paul?
- No.
Once the bomb went off we lost communication.
- What was the last we heard from them?
- Jack and Paul found something.
It must be incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So they set off the EMP to destroy the evidence.
That's my guess.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking action is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis.
- Could Jack or Paul have been injured?
- No.
An EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
- Call me when he talks.
- Yes, sir.
No!
Drop your gun or I'll kill him.
I said drop it!
Paul, where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's in here.
Take a seat.
- Where is it?
- Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
- I couldn't have held out much longer.
- You did great.
Let's go.
For those who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU effective immediately.
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until she got here.
Why don't you bring everyone up to speed?
Yes, sir.
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks,
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster, the third-largest defence contractor in the country.
We know that Marwan's been using the alias "Harris Barnes".
What we don't know is how he evaded their security checks.
He knows we're after him so he's probably gone dark.
His association with McLennan-Forster is our main focus.
Jack and Paul Raines went to inspect his computer files, but as they were doing so, an EMP bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's database.
It fried every electrical device in an eight-mile radius - streetlights, computers, cars, cellphones, everything.
Did they find anything before detonation?
Yeah, but we haven't been able to contact them.
But we have to assume whoever detonated the EMP wants Jack and Paul eliminated.
- Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
- Not yet.
Once the effects subside we'll send two teams in with functioning electronics.
The problem is until we find Jack and Paul, they won't be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines, but the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony.
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.
- Thank you.
- What do you want me to do?
Division's sending over a supplemental list of terrorists who've had contact with Marwan.
Check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done and I'd like you to do it.
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle!
When I last saw you, you couldn't stay sober to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
Level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now, all you need is three.
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
I know your history, I know you were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
- But if this is gonna be a problem, I...
- His being here will not affect my work.
Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving reports from LAPD indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked-out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire and stores ransacked.
Witnesses report shots were heard.
There may be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
That could be the same people that were after Jack.
I don't get it.
What could be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something implicating McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if they helped Marwan today.
- This is Anderson.
- It's time for you to go.
Marwan, your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, of course.
- How long will it take you to get there?
- Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
It's heading to McLennan-Forster.
It's not responding to any of our ID requests.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
Excuse me.
There's a chopper in the dead zone, not one of ours.
- Police?
- Not one of theirs either.
I checked.
We picked it up by its electronic signature.
- Where's it going?
- Straight to McLennan-Forster.
Could it be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
- They'd give the police a call sign.
- It's a search-and-destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men, fully armed.
- Who would have sent it?
- Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
I'll be right back.
- Jack, I can't do this.
- You don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the men we're looking for.
They have an encoded computer print-out.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware, one of them is a CTU field agent.
- You want us to kill a federal agent?
- I'll take care of him.
He went bad, helped the terrorists, dragged the company into it.
LAPD is responding to this area.
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to stay off their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
We spotted two men headed east on Addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position a mile down the road and then move in.
- We'll fan out and come in from behind.
- You got it.
Get me that chopper back in the northwest corner.
Let's move.
Come on.
Come on, this way.
This way.
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.
Get away from here!
- Paul, get down!
Get out of here!
The next one won't miss!
- I'm a federal agent.
Sure you are.
Get away from here.
Look, we need your help.
Go!
Now!
Hey, just relax.
I'm leaving.
OK?
I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon!
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
- Paul!
- Yeah?
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
You should have helped stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or did they get them too?
- Behind the counter, yeah.
- Show me.
Look, we're the first to be hit because we're Arabs.
- We had nothing to do with what happened...
- Quiet.
He doesn't care.
Take what you need, but leave two guns.
We chased the looters once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
- We needed to take cover.
- What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men chasing us caused this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys electrical activity within eight miles.
So everything that's happened, the looting, the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
- Commandos?
- He's right.
You need to leave this store.
Right now we're their target.
You're not safe here.
- Why don't you leave?
It's our store.
- If I had a choice, I would, but you have weapons and shelter.
Right now there's no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows that we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large-enough firefight, we can force their commandos to communicate their positions.
- And CTU will pick up the signal?
- Yes.
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage.
And we only have to hold down till CTU gets here.
...nothing, all right?
- All right.
My brother and I talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property, but this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighbourhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.
I have an update from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.
It's not as bad as we had feared.
How you doing?
Sit down.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple hours ago, when we thought that Paul was involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know.
I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
I just...
But you're not sure you feel the same way as before, is that it?
Something like that.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
OK.
I don't have much time.
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information.
- Yes, I saw the report.
- Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Her daughter died.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand, but there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
She promised that it would be expunged from my record, and I'd be bumped up two pay grades, so I want to make sure that will still happen.
I'll look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.
I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
- I need security to station one.
- Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn't.
So you're firing me?
You can't.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
- Back entrance locked?
- Yeah.
Put these in each window.
Have ammunition ready.
And I want you to get two hunting vests.
Fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
I'll need you two to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin.
Everyone is up to their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.
- You may want to reconsider.
- No.
I don't trust her.
Then what about Agent Almeida?
Michelle, we could use the help, and he's already proved himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
Work with Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
- I'll advise internal stations of the change.
Give me an update.
It's quiet except for emergency-vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU teams are ready.
All we can do is spread them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams, meet strength with strength.
- Where would you place them?
- At McLennan-Forster.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
I know the way he thinks.
The hostiles will break radio silence when they attack.
We can follow the signal.
He's gonna engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.
But if we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
Castle, go ahead as planned.
Be ready to move.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
- OK.
- All right.
Team leader, this is Spectre.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer, between Flower and Third.
Copythat.
- He's not returning fire.
- Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
- And what do we do?
- Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
- Audrey.
- Yes?
Let DOD know we're using law-enforcement channels in the blackout zone.
- I told them we might need their feeds.
- You don't need them?
- No.
- All right, no problem.
I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just, when you walk into a hailstorm you have to be decisive.
I understand, and I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but...
But what?
I think that you should re-evaluate your opinion of Tony.
- Why is that?
- This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
He went to the one person he knew would come through for him
- Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
- I didn't know.
- We had to spend a couple hours with him.
It's true, Tony has a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does.
And I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside, he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronise me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say I will consider seriously.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
You scared?
- You sure you both want to do this?
- Yeah.
My brother and I are more angry about these attacks than you are.
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna try to be part of the solution.
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
- Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
And he worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy, but if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you, just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle said that you were doing a search on ties to Marwan.
May I help?
- Do you have a sign-on for the SYKY server?
- In Washington?
- Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
- Yeah.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Anything else?
- It should kick off a few names.
You can help me write them down once it's done searching.
So... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
- I said that Jack called you.
- Anything else?
I didn't say that you were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that, and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
- A lot different than Washington.
- Yeah.
It is different.
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Jack had taken a desk job in DC.
He said he was happier this way.
Uh-huh.
Well, you've gotten a chance to see him in both worlds today.
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through today, you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them.
Each signal is a radio, all using the same frequency.
They're planning an attack.
They're at Flower and Third, a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right.
He's actually drawing them in.
Go, go!
A sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo One, move in.
The spread's picking up automatic-weapon fire.
- When will our teams get there?
- The ground teams will arrive first.
- When?
- At least five or six minutes.
- Who's helping them?
- I don't know.
They gotta be civilians.
We need to end this and get that document.
Understood?
- Yeah, I understand.
- Let's go.
Hey, Naji!
Hey!
Hey, are you hit?
Hey?
You OK?
Naji!
It hit the clip.
Naji.
Fall back!
All right!
Now!
Now!
Move forward!
Hurry!
Take my shotgun.
Because of their night goggles, if they get within ten feet, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
Jack?
The gunfire's stopped.
- Are the teams on site?
- Not yet.
The commandos could have taken over the location.
They might have taken the information back.
Try to get in touch with our teams.
I'll update Division.
If McLennan-Forster won the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
- CTU personnel are approaching the location.
- It's Castle.
We're about to engage.
- How many hostiles?
- Six down outside.
Unknown inside.
- Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul alive?
- Unknown at this point.
The hostiles cannot leave with the information from McLennan-Forster.
- You understand?
- We'll do our best.
No.
Listen.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing's about.
Roger that.
Jack!
- Yeah?
I'm here.
- You safe?
- Yeah.
- All hostiles are down.
We're clear.
- OK.
Go ahead.
This way.
- This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
- Stand by.
- Curtis.
- It's Castle.
- Lee, what's your status?
- Location secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
- What about their information?
- Unknown at this point.
Keep this line open.
Jack's OK.
The team secured the store.
- What about Paul?
- He's with him.
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?
- We don't know yet.
Stay in touch.
Whatever they get, be ready to work up.
You got it.
Yeah?
- You want us to help process?
- No.
We'll do it when we sift the data.
- Sure that's not a problem?
- Yeah.
- All right.
We'll wait for your confirmation.
- Yeah.
OK.
- Jack and Paul are OK.
- What about the information?
We don't know.
Even if Jack has it, we don't know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.
McLennan-Forster's involvement should yield some leads.
That will have to be worked up here.
Their computers were knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No.
You know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now...
Let's just say that I've been better.
Quite frankly, seeing you here today has only made things worse.
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'll make sure you get help putting the store together.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
Set up a detail, five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store.
Understand?
Jack, look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul!
Medic!
Come on.
Just stay with me.
Come on, Paul, stay with me.
No, no.
Paul!
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me.
Jack, it's OK.
The medic's here.
Jack, let the medics do their work.
- Any problems?
- No, I'm here.
- Are we on schedule?
- Yes.
- What about you?
- I'm leaving now.
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.

ENGLISH SDH
Here are all the access codes to CTU and Division.
- Thanks.
- I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
Sir, Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.
Tony, thank you for filling in.
And I'd like you to stick around and assist Ms Dessler.
- Who?
- Michelle Dessler.
Do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?
Turns out the man we're looking for works there.
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.
OK.
I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employees, Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, a terrorist responsible for today's attack and theft of the override.
We need you to take your IT systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it.
Print it out, now.
Now!
He's gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb.
We have to use it now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that's electrical gets fried.
I'm gonna try and stop it.
If I don't, take the hard copy, meet me in front of the building.
CTU agent's heading down near you.
Don't let him near it.
Oh, my God.
Are any electronic devices working?
Only the basic battery-powered devices.
- How many square miles are affected?
- 80, including southeast downtown.
OK.
Hold your position until the readings stabilize.
- Any word from Jack or Paul?
- No.
Once the bomb went off we lost communication.
- What was the last we heard from them?
- Jack and Paul found something.
It must be incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So they set off the EMP to destroy the evidence.
That's my guess.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking action is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis.
- Could Jack or Paul have been injured?
- No.
An EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
- Call me when he talks.
- Yes, sir.
No!
Drop your gun or I'll kill him.
I said drop it!
Paul, where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's in here.
Take a seat.
- Where is it?
- Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
- I couldn't have held out much longer.
- You did great.
Let's go.
For those who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU effective immediately.
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until she got here.
Why don't you bring everyone up to speed?
Yes, sir.
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks,
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster, the third-largest defense contractor in the country.
We know that Marwan's been using the alias "Harris Barnes".
What we don't know is how he evaded their security checks.
He knows we're after him so he's probably gone dark.
His association with McLennan-Forster is our main focus.
Jack and Paul Raines went to inspect his computer files, but as they were doing so, an EMP bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's database.
It fried every electrical device in an eight-mile radius - streetlights, computers, cars, cell phones, everything.
Did they find anything before detonation?
Yeah, but we haven't been able to contact them.
But we have to assume whoever detonated the EMP wants Jack and Paul eliminated.
- Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
- Not yet.
Once the effects subside we'll send two teams in with functioning electronics.
The problem is until we find Jack and Paul, they won't be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines, but the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony.
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.
- Thank you.
- What do you want me to do?
Division's sending over a supplemental list of terrorists who've had contact with Marwan.
Check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done and I'd like you to do it.
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle!
When I last saw you, you couldn't stay sober to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
Level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now, all you need is three.
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
I know your history, I know you were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
- But if this is gonna be a problem, I...
- His being here will not affect my work.
Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving reports from LAPD indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked-out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire and stores ransacked.
Witnesses report shots were heard.
There may be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
That could be the same people that were after Jack.
I don't get it.
What could be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something implicating McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if they helped Marwan today.
- This is Anderson.
- It's time for you to go.
Marwan, your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, of course.
- How long will it take you to get there?
- Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
It's heading to McLennan-Forster.
It's not responding to any of our ID requests.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
Excuse me.
There's a chopper in the dead zone, not one of ours.
- Police?
- Not one of theirs either.
I checked.
We picked it up by its electronic signature.
- Where's it going?
- Straight to McLennan-Forster.
Could it be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
- They'd give the police a call sign.
- It's a search-and-destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men, fully armed.
- Who would have sent it?
- Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
I'll be right back.
- Jack, I can't do this.
- You don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the men we're looking for.
They have an encoded computer print-out.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware, one of them is a CTU field agent.
- You want us to kill a federal agent?
- I'll take care of him.
He went bad, helped the terrorists, dragged the company into it.
LAPD is responding to this area.
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to stay off their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
We spotted two men headed east on Addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position a mile down the road and then move in.
- We'll fan out and come in from behind.
- You got it.
Get me that chopper back in the northwest corner.
Let's move.
Come on.
Come on, this way.
This way.
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.
- Get away from here!
- Paul, get down!
Get out of here!
The next one won't miss!
- I'm a federal agent.
- Sure you are.
Get away from here.
Look, we need your help.
Go!
Now!
Hey, just relax.
I'm leaving.
OK?
I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon!
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
- Paul!
- Yeah?
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
You should have helped stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or did they get them too?
- Behind the counter, yeah.
- Show me.
Look, we're the first to be hit because we're Arabs.
- We had nothing to do with what happened...
- Quiet.
He doesn't care.
Take what you need, but leave two guns.
We chased the looters once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
- We needed to take cover.
- What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men chasing us caused this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys electrical activity within eight miles.
So everything that's happened, the looting, the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
- Commandos?
- He's right.
You need to leave this store.
Right now we're their target.
You're not safe here.
- Why don't you leave?
It's our store.
- If I had a choice, I would, but you have weapons and shelter.
Right now there's no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows that we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large-enough firefight, we can force their commandos to communicate their positions.
- And CTU will pick up the signal?
- Yes.
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage.
And we only have to hold down till CTU gets here.
- .. nothing, all right?
- All right.
My brother and I talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property, but this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighborhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.
I have an update from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.
It's not as bad as we had feared.
How you doing?
Sit down.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple hours ago, when we thought that Paul was involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know.
I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
I just...
But you're not sure you feel the same way as before, is that it?
Something like that.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
OK.
I don't have much time.
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information.
- Yes, I saw the report.
- Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Her daughter died.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand, but there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
She promised that it would be expunged from my record, and I'd be bumped up two pay grades, so I want to make sure that will still happen.
I'II look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.
I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
- I need security to station one.
- Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn't.
So you're firing me?
You can't.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
- Back entrance locked?
- Yeah.
Put these in each window.
Have ammunition ready.
And I want you to get two hunting vests.
Fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
I'll need you two to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin.
Everyone is up to their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.
- You may want to reconsider.
- No.
I don't trust her.
Then what about Agent Almeida?
Michelle, we could use the help, and he's already proved himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
Work with Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
- I'll advise internal stations of the change.
- Give me an update.
It's quiet except for emergency-vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU teams are ready.
All we can do is spread them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams, meet strength with strength.
- Where would you place them?
- At McLennan-Forster.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
I know the way he thinks.
The hostiles will break radio silence when they attack.
We can follow the signal.
He's gonna engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.
But if we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
Castle, go ahead as planned.
Be ready to move.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
- OK.
- All right.
Team leader, this is Spectre.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer, between Flower and Third.
Copy that.
- He's not returning fire.
- Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
- And what do we do?
- Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
- Audrey.
- Yes?
Let DOD know we're using law-enforcement channels in the blackout zone.
- I told them we might need their feeds.
- You don't need them?
- No.
- All right, no problem.
I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just, when you walk into a hailstorm you have to be decisive.
I understand, and I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but...
But what?
I think that you should re-evaluate your opinion of Tony.
- Why is that?
- This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
He went to the one person he knew would come through for him
- Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
- I didn't know.
- We had to spend a couple hours with him.
It's true, Tony has a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does.
And I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside, he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronize me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say I will consider seriously.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
You scared?
- You sure you both want to do this?
- Yeah.
My brother and I are more angry about these attacks than you are.
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna try to be part of the solution.
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
- Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
And he worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy, but if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you, just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle said that you were doing a search on ties to Marwan.
May I help?
- Do you have a sign-on for the SYKY server?
- In Washington?
- Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
- Yeah.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Anything else?
- It should kick off a few names.
You can help me write them down once it's done searching.
So... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
- I said that Jack called you.
- Anything else?
I didn't say that you were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that, and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
- A lot different than Washington.
- Yeah.
It is different.
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Jack had taken a deskjob in DC.
He said he was happier this way.
Uh-huh.
Well, you've gotten a chance to see him in both worlds today.
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through today, you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them.
Each signal is a radio, all using the same frequency.
They're planning an attack.
They're at Flower and Third, a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right.
He's actually drawing them in.
Go, go!
A sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo One, move in.
The spread's picking up automatic-weapon fire.
- When will our teams get there?
- The ground teams will arrive first.
- When?
- At least five or six minutes.
- Who's helping them?
- I don't know.
They gotta be civilians.
We need to end this and get that document.
Understood?
- Yeah, I understand.
- Let's go.
Hey, Naji!
Hey!
Hey, are you hit?
Hey?
You OK?
Naji!
It hit the clip.
Naji.
Fall back!
All right!
Now!
Now!
Move forward!
Hurry!
Take my shotgun.
Because of their night goggles, if they get within ten feet, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
Jack?
Jack?
The gunfire's stopped.
- Are the teams on site?
- Not yet.
The commandos could have taken over the location.
They might have taken the information back.
Try to get in touch with our teams.
I'll update Division.
If McLennan-Forster won the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
- CTU personnel are approaching the location.
- It's Castle.
We're about to engage.
- How many hostiles?
- Six down outside.
Unknown inside.
- Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul alive?
- Unknown at this point.
The hostiles cannot leave with the information from McLennan-Forster.
- You understand?
- We'll do our best.
No.
Listen.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing's about.
Roger that.
- Jack!
- Yeah?
I'm here.
- You safe?
- Yeah.
- All hostiles are down.
We're clear.
- OK.
Go ahead.
This way.
- This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
- Stand by.
- Curtis.
- It's Castle.
- Lee, what's your status?
- Location secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
- What about their information?
- Unknown at this point.
Keep this line open.
Jack's OK.
The team secured the store.
- What about Paul?
- He's with him.
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?
- We don't know yet.
Stay in touch.
Whatever they get, be ready to work up.
You got it.
Yeah?
- You want us to help process?
- No.
We'll do it when we sift the data.
- Sure that's not a problem?
- Yeah.
- All right.
We'll wait for your confirmation.
- Yeah.
OK.
- Jack and Paul are OK.
- What about the information?
We don't know.
Even if Jack has it, we don't know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.
McLennan-Forster's involvement should yield some leads.
That will have to be worked up here.
Their computers were knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No.
You know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now...
Let's just say that I've been better.
Quite frankly, seeing you here today has only made things worse.
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'll make sure you get help putting the store together.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
Set up a detail, five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store.
Understand?
Jack, look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul!
Medic!
Come on.
Just stay with me.
Come on, Paul, stay with me.
No, no.
Paul!
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me.
Jack, it's OK.
The medic's here.
Jack, let the medics do their work.
- Any problems?
- No, I'm here.
- Are we on schedule?
- Yes.
- What about you?
- I'm leaving now.
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.

ENGLISH SDH
Here are all the access codes for CTU and Division.
Thanks.
I'm probably gonna be gone a while.
If you need anything,you can always call me at home.
Excuse me,sir.
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.
Tony,I want to thank you for filling in.
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.
Who?
Michelle Dessler, do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
Why there?
It turns out the man we're looking for works there.
Need to get into their computer system?
Yeah.
Okay,I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employees,a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack and the theft of the override device.
We need you to take your I.T. systems off-line so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
Damn it.
what you doing
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
,... that's it..
Print it out,now!
Now!
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb, we have to use it,now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off,everything within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried.
I'm going to try and stop it.
If I don't,
I want you to take the hard copy and try to meet me in the front of the building.
A CTU agent is heading down near you.
Don't let him anywhere near it!
Oh,my God.
the following takes place... are any elect only the...
How many square miles were affected by the blackout?
Approximately,eight.
The southeast quadrant of downtown.
Okay,hold your position until the readings stabilize.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
Once the pulse bomb went off, we lost all communication with them.
What was the last word we heard from them?
Well,Jack and Paul found something.
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So that's why they set off the EMP,to destroy the evidence.
That'd be my guess.
That'd be my guess.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking aggressive action, is evidence against them.
Yeah,but it's not proof.
Curtis,could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation?
No,an EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
Call me when he talks.
no
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!
I said drop it!
Paul?
Where's the data printout?
I hid it... in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've got to get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
It's here.
Take a seat.
Where is it?
Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
Is this it?
Yeah,it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
I don't think I could have held out much longer.
You did great.
Let's go.
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU, effective immediately.
Tony,I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here.
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed?
Yes,sir.
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks,Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster, the third largest defense contractor in the country.
Now we know that Marwan's been using the alias Harris Barnes.
What we don't know yet, is how he managed to evade their security checks.
Marwan knows we're looking for him,so he's probably gone dark.
But his association with McLennan-Forster has become our primary focus.
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the company to inspect his computer files.
But as they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's entire database.
It also fried every electrical device within an eight-mile radius.
Streetlights,computers,cars, cell phones,everything.
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation?
Yes,but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast.
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.
Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
Not yet.
Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided, we'll send two teams in with fully-functional electronics.
The only problem is,until we find Jack and Paul, they're not going to be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines.
But the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony?
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.
Thank you.
Division is sending over a supplemental list of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan.
I want you to check any names that have been flagged by other agencies,including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, it doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done.
And I'd like youto do it.
Michelle,Jack and Paul have information that could be vital in helping us end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle...
The last time I saw you, you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
A level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now,all you need is three.
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflictson the job.
I know your history.
I know that you guys were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
But if this is going to be a problem...
His being here will not affect my work.
I won't let it.
Now,if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it,
I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD, indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire, stores have been ransacked, shots were heard.
There may even be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
Shots were heard?
That could be the same people that are after Jack.
I don't get it.
What information could Jack have found that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something that implicates McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if there's proof that they helped Marwanwith today's attacks.
This is Anderson.
It is time for you to go.
Marwan,your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
Are you ready?
Yes,of course.
How long will it take you to get there?
Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
The helicopter's heading to McLennan-Forster, and it's not responding to any of our ID requests.
You sure?
Yeah,I'm positive.
Michelle.
exuse me
There's a chopper flying through the dead zone, not one of ours.
Police?
No.
Not one of theirs either,I checked.
A chopper that size carries 20 menfully armed.
Who would have sent it?
Whoever set off the EMP.
They're going in after Jack and Paul.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
Jack,I can't do this.
Don't have a choice.
Come on.
You got it.
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner.
Let's move!
Come on,this way.
This way.
Where do we go now?
Weapons and ammunition.
Get away from me!
Get down!
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss!
I'm a federal agent.
Yeah,sure you are!
Get away from here!
Look,we need your help!
go!
now!
Okay,just relax.
I'm leaving!
Okay,I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon.
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
Paul!
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
Well,you should have been here to help us to stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or they get them,too?
Behind the counter
Show me.
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're Arab Americans.
And we're good citizens.
We had nothing to do with what happened today!
Be quiet,Safah.
He doesn't care.
take what you need, but leave us two guns.
We've chased the looters off once,but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
We needed to take cover.
What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys all electrical activity within an eight-mile radius.
So everything that's happened to us tonight- the looting, the blackout- it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes,and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks from happening.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
Commandos?
He's right.
You both need to leave this store.
Right now,we're their target.
You're not safe here with us.
Why don't you leave?
This is our store.
If I had a choice,I would!
You have weapons and shelter.
Right now,there is no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows we're in trouble.
They also know we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight, we can force their commandos to use radio frequency to communicate their positions.
And CTU will pick up the signal?
yes
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage, and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here.
My brother and I talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property.
But this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
You don't understand.
For years,we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighborhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
I agree.
The President should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
Keep me informed.
I have an update on the damage from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.
It's not quite as bad as we had feared.
How are you doing?
sit down
Any word from Jack or Paul?
no
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple of hours ago, when we thought that Paulwas somehow involved with the attacks,
Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted,but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know,I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
Just...
But you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before,is that it?
Something like that.
Could I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
Okay.
Um...
I don't have much time.
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information earlier today.
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn't.
Is the back entrance locked?
Yeah.
Okay.
Put one of these in each window.
Have extra ammunition standing by.
Then I want you to get two hunting vests, fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms. Gavin won't be workingwith us anymore.
...her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin as it is.
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already or not qualified to replace her.
You may want to reconsider.
No,I don't trust her.
yeah
You'll be working with Agent Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar,I need you to call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
okay
I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes.
Give me an update first.
The zone is still pretty quiet,except for emergency vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU's tact teams are standing by.
But the best we can do is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack.
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is.
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong,
Jack and Paul won't survive an attack.
If we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
ok
Team leader,this is Specter.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer,between Flower and Third.
Audrey?
yes?
Could you let DOD know that we've piggybacked onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone?
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds.
So you don't need them any more?
-No.
All right,no problem.
Um,look,I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm, you have to be decisive.
I think that you should re-evaluate your professional opinion of Tony.
Why's that?
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
And he went to the one person that he knew would come through for him and that was Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
I didn't know that.
After that,we just spent a couple hours with him.
It's true,Tony does have a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does, and I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Thanks.
Tony,look,I just want you to know that... just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously.
Good.
guys
You sure you both want to do this?
Yeah.
My brother and I, we're more angry about these attacks today than you are.
But if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
yeah
They're here.
Tony,Michelle just said that you were doing a search on possible ties to Marwan.
May I help?
Do you have a sign-on for the Zeitgeist server?
In Washington?
Yeah,it would save me time if I could use it on this search.
Yeah.
There you go.
Thanks.
Anything else?
It should kick off a few names.
You can help me run them down once it's done searching.
Okay,great.
So,um... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
I said that Jack called you.
Anything else?
Well,I didn't say you that were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that
A lot different than Washington.
Yeah,it is different.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them!
See those signals underground?
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency.
That's because they're planning an attack.
They converged on a location on Flower and Third, about a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right, he's actually drawing them in.
Sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo One,move in.
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire at the site of the radio transmission.
How much longer before our teams get there?
The ground teams are closest.
They'll get there first.
When?
At least five or six minutes.
Who's helping him?
I don't know.
They've got to be civilians.
We need to end this quickly and get that document.
Is that understood?
Yeah.
I understand.
Let's go.
Raji!
Hey,Raji!
You okay?
Raji?
Fall back!
Okay,because of the night vision goggles, if they get within ten feet of you, shine your flashlight in their eyes,it'll blind them.
ok
Jack!
Jack!
The gunfire stopped.
The teams on site?
Not yet.
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location.
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul.
Get in touch with the teams.
I'll update Division.
If McLennan-Forster win the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
there is no way to tell
CTU personnel are approaching the location.
CTU,this is Castle, we're about to engage.
How many hostiles have been sighted?
Six down outside,unknown number inside.
Lee,it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul still alive?
Unknown at this point.
All right,look,the hostiles cannot be allowed to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennan-Forster.
Do you understand?
We'll do the best we can.
No,Lee,listen to me.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing is about.
Roger that.
Jack!
Yeah?
I'm here!
You and Raines safe?
-Yeah.
All hostiles are down.
We're clear.
Copy.
Yeah,Dan.
No,no,my people will take care of that when we sift through the data.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jack and Paul are okay.
What about the information?
We don't know if Jack has it yet.
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going to bring us any closer to finding Marwan.
Well,we know that McLennan-Forster is involved.
That should yield some leads.
Well,it's going to have to be worked up here, because McLennan-Forster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
all right
I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together.
I need you to get this to CTU.
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me?
Jack!
Look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
Medic!
Come on,stay with me.
Come on,Paul.
Stay with me.
No,no,Paul.
Paul,stay with me.
Come on,look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me,okay
Jack,let the medic do the work.
Any problems?
What about you?
I'm leaving now.
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.
Ê± ¼ä£ºf1_ralf
Here are all the access codes to CTU and Division.
- Thanks.
- I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
Sir, Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.
Tony, thank you for filling in.
And I'd like you to stick around and assist Ms Dessler.
- Who?
- Michelle Dessler.
Do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?
Turns out the man we're looking for works there.
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.
OK.
I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employees, Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, a terrorist responsible for today's attack and theft of the override.
We need you to take your IT systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it.
Print it out, now.
Now!
He's gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb.
We have to use it now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that's electrical gets fried.
I'm gonna try and stop it.
If I don't, take the hard copy, meet me in front of the building.
CTU agent's heading down near you.
Don't let him near it.
Oh, my God.
Are any electronic devices working?
Only the basic battery-powered devices.
- How many square miles are affected?
- 80, including southeast downtown.
OK.
Hold your position until the readings stabilize.
- Any word from Jack or Paul?
- No.
Once the bomb went off we lost communication.
- What was the last we heard from them?
- Jack and Paul found something.
It must be incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So they set off the EMP to destroy the evidence.
That's my guess.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking action is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis.
- Could Jack or Paul have been injured?
- No.
An EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
- Call me when he talks.
- Yes, sir.
No!
Drop your gun or I'll kill him.
I said drop it!
Paul, where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's in here.
Take a seat.
- Where is it?
- Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.

I need the access codes for CTU and Division.

- Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
Excuse me.
There's a chopper in the dead zone, not one of ours.
- Police?
- Not one of theirs either.
I checked.
We picked it up by its electronic signature.
- Where's it going?
- Straight to McLennan-Forster.
Could it be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
- They'd give the police a call sign.
- It's a search-and-destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men, fully armed.
- Who would have sent it?
- Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
I'll be right back.
- Jack, I can't do this.
- You don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the men we're looking for.
They have an encoded computer print-out.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware, one of them is a CTU field agent.
- You want us to kill a federal agent?
- I'll take care of him.
He went bad, helped the terrorists, dragged the company into it.
LAPD is responding to this area.
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to stay off their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
We spotted two men headed east on Addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position a mile down the road and then move in.
- We'll fan out and come in from behind.
- You got it.
Get me that chopper back in the northwest corner.
Let's move.
Come on.
Come on, this way.
This way.
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.
- Get away from here!
- Paul, get down!
Get out of here!
The next one won't miss!
- I'm a federal agent.
- Sure you are.
Get away from here.
Look, we need your help.
Go!
Now!
Hey, just relax.
I'm leaving.
OK?
I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon!
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
- Paul!
- Yeah?
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
You should have helped stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or did they get them too?
- Behind the counter, yeah.
- Show me.
Look, we're the first to be hit because we're Arabs.
- We had nothing to do with what happened...
- Quiet.
He doesn't care.
Take what you need, but leave two guns.
We chased the looters once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
- We needed to take cover.
- What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men chasing us caused this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys electrical activity within eight miles.
So everything that's happened, the looting, the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
- Commandos?
- He's right.
You need to leave this store.
Right now we're their target.
You're not safe here.
- Why don't you leave?
It's our store.
- If I had a choice, I would, but you have weapons and shelter.
Right now there's no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?

So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage.
And we only have to hold down till CTU gets here.
- ...nothing, all right?
- All right.
My brother and I talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property, but this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighborhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.
I have an update from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.

It's important.
OK.
I don't have much time.
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information.
- Yes, I saw the report.
- Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Her daughter died.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand, but there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
She promised that it would be expunged from my record, and I'd be bumped up two pay grades, so I want to make sure that will still happen.
I'll look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.
I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
- I need security to station one.
- Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn't.
So you're firing me?
You can't.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
- Back entrance locked?
- Yeah.
Put these in each window.
Have ammunition ready.
And I want you to get two hunting vests.
Fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
I'll need you two to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin.
Everyone is up to their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.
- You may want to reconsider.
- No.
I don't trust her.
Then what about Agent Almeida?
Michelle, we could use the help, and he's already proved himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
Work with Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
- I'll advise internal stations of the change.
- Give me an update.
It's quiet except for emergency-vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU teams are ready.
All we can do is spread them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams, meet strength with strength.
- Where would you place them?
- At McLennan-Forster.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
I know the way he thinks.
The hostiles will break radio silence when they attack.
We can follow the signal.
He's gonna engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.
But if we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
Castle, go ahead as planned.
Be ready to move.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
- OK.
- All right.
Team leader, this is Spectre.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer, between Flower and Third.
Copy that.
- He's not returning fire.
- Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
- And what do we do?
- Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
- Audrey.
- Yes?
Let DOD know we're using law-enforcement channels in the blackout zone.
- I told them we might need their feeds.
- You don't need them?
- No.
- All right, no problem.
I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just, when you walk into a hailstorm you have to be decisive.
I understand, and I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but...
But what?
I think that you should re-evaluate your opinion of Tony.
- Why is that?
- This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
He went to the one person he knew would come through for him
- Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
- I didn't know.
- We had to spend a couple hours with him.
It's true, Tony has a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does.
And I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside, he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronize me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say I will consider seriously.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
You scared?
- You sure you both want to do this?
- Yeah.
My brother and I are more angry about these attacks than you are.
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna try to be part of the solution.
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
- Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
And he worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy, but if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you, just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle said that you were doing a search on ties to Marwan.
May I help?
- Do you have a sign-on for the SYKY server?
- In Washington?
- Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
- Yeah.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Anything else?
- It should kick off a few names.
You can help me write them down once it's done searching.
So... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
- I said that Jack called you.
- Anything else?
I didn't say that you were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that, and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
- A lot different than Washington.
- Yeah.
It is different.
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Jack had taken a deskjob in DC.
He said he was happier this way.
Uh-huh.
Well, you've gotten a chance to see him in both worlds today.
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through today, you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them.
Each signal is a radio, all using the same frequency.
They're planning an attack.
They're at Flower and Third, a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right.
He's actually drawing them in.
Go, go!
A sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo One, move in.
The spread's picking up automatic-weapon fire.
- When will our teams get there?
- The ground teams will arrive first.
- When?
- At least five or six minutes.
- Who's helping them?
- I don't know.
They gotta be civilians.
We need to end this and get that document.
Understood?
- Yeah, I understand.
- Let's go.
Hey, Naji!
Hey!
Hey, are you hit?
Hey?
You OK?
Naji!
It hit the clip.
Naji.
Fall back!
All right!
Now!
Now!
Move forward!
Hurry!
Take my shotgun.
Because of their night goggles, if they get within ten feet, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
Jack?
Jack?
The gunfire's stopped.
- Are the teams on site?
- Not yet.
The commandos could have taken over the location.
They might have taken the information back.
Try to get in touch with our teams.
I'll update Division.
If McLennan-Forster won the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
- CTU personnel are approaching the location.
- It's Castle.
We're about to engage.
- How many hostiles?
- Six down outside.
Unknown inside.
- Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul alive?
- Unknown at this point.
The hostiles cannot leave with the information from McLennan-Forster.
- You understand?
- We'll do our best.
No.
Listen.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing's about.
Roger that.
- Jack!
- Yeah?
I'm here.
- You safe?
- Yeah.
- All hostiles are down.
We're clear.
- OK.
Go ahead.
This way.
- This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
- Stand by.
- Curtis.
- It's Castle.
- Lee, what's your status?
- Location secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
- What about their information?
- Unknown at this point.
Keep this line open.
Jack's OK.
The team secured the store.
- What about Paul?
- He's with him.
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?
- We don't know yet.
Stay in touch.
Whatever they get, be ready to work up.
You got it.
Yeah?
- You want us to help process?
- No.
We'll do it when we sift the data.
- Sure that's not a problem?
- Yeah.
- All right.
We'll wait for your confirmation.
- Yeah.
OK.
- Jack and Paul are OK.
- What about the information?
We don't know.
Even if Jack has it, we don't know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.
McLennan-Forster's involvement should yield some leads.
That will have to be worked up here.
Their computers were knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No.
You know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now...
Let's just say that I've been better.
Quite frankly, seeing you here today has only made things worse.
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'll make sure you get help putting the store together.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
Set up a detail, five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store.
Understand?
Jack, look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul!
Medic!
Come on.
Just stay with me.
Come on, Paul, stay with me.
No, no.
Paul!
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me.
Jack, it's OK.
The medic's here.
Jack, let the medics do their work.
- Any problems?
- No, I'm here.
- Are we on schedule?
- Yes.
- What about you?
- I'm leaving now.
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.
24 S04E13 Previously On 24
Here are all the access codes for CTU and division.
Thanks.
I'm probably gonna be gone a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
Excuse me, sir.
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.
Tony, I want to thank you for filling in.
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.
Who?
Michelle Dessler, do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
Why there?
It turns out the man we're looking for works there.
Need to get into their computer system?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employee, a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack and the theft of the override device.
We need you to take your I.T.Systems off-line so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
Damn it.
What's he doing?
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch,It's encrypted.
That's it.
Print it out, now!
Now!
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb, we have to use it, now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried.
I'm going to try and stop it.
If I don't, I want you to take the hard copy and try to meet me in the front of the building.
A CTU agent is heading down near you.
Don't let him anywhere near it!
Oh, my god.
The following takes place between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.
Our any electronic device is working in that area?
Only the battery power device.
How many square miles were affected by the blackout?
Approximately, eight.
The southeast quadrant of downtown.
Okay, hold your position until the readings stabilize.
Copy that.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
Once the pulse bomb went off, we lost all communication with them.
What was the last word we heard from them?
Well, Jack and Paul found something.
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So that's why they set off the EMP, to destroy the evidence.
That'd be my guess.
This doesn't make sense.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking aggressive action, is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis, could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation?
No, an EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
Call me when he talks.
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!
I said drop it!
Paul?
Where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've got to get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
It's here.
Take a seat.
Where is it?
Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
Is this it?
Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
I don't think I could have held out much longer.
You did great.
Let's go.
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU, effective immediately.
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here.
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed?
Yes, sir.
Less than an hour ago we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term Employee of McLennan-Forster the third largest defense contractor in the country.
Now we know that Marean's been using the alias Harris Barnes.
What we don't know yet, is how he managed to evade their security checks.
Marwan knows we're looking for him, so he's probably gone dark.
But his association with McLennan-Forster has become our primary focus.
Jack Bauer and Paul raines went to the company to inspect his computer files.
But as they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated wiping out the company's entire database.
It also fried every electrical device within an eight-mile radius.
Streetlights, computers, cars, cell phones, everything.
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation?
Yes, but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast.
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks
Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.
Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
Not yet.
Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided, we'll send two teams in with fully-functional electronics.
The only problem is, until we find Jack and
Paul, they're not going to be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul raines.
But the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony?
I need the access codes for CTU and division.
Thank you.
What do you want me to do?
Division is sending over a supplemental list of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan.
I want you to check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, it doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done.
And I'd like you to do it.
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could be vital in helping us end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle... the last time I saw you, you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
A level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now, all you need is three.
Is there a problem with agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
I know your history.
I know that you guys were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
But if this is going to be a problem... his being here will not affect my work.
I won't let it.
Now, if secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD, indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire, stores have been ransacked, shots were heard.
There may even be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
Shots were heard?
That could be the same people that are after Jack.
I don't get it.
What information could Jack have found that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something that implicates McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if there's proof that they helped Marwan with today's attacks.
This is Anderson.
It is time for you to go.
Marean, your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
Are you ready?
Yes, of course.
How long will it take you to get there?
Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
The helicopter's heading to McLennan-Forster, and it's not responding to any of our id requests.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
There's a chopper flying through the dead zone, not one of ours.
Police?
No.
Not one of theirs either, I checked.
We wouldn't have picked it up if it wasn't for its electronic signature.
Where's it going?
Straight for McLennan-Forster.
Now, is it possible that it can be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
They would have given the police a call sign.
No, that's a search and destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men fully armed.
Who would have sent it?
Whoever set off the EMP.
They're going in after Jack and Paul.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
Be right back.
Jack, I can't do this.
Don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the two men we're looking for.
They have a document, a computer printout that's encoded.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware one of them is a CTU field agent.
You want us to kill a federal agent?
I'll take care of him personally.
He went bad.
Started helping the terrorists and dragged the company into it.
LAPD is beginning to respond to this area.
So we're going to have to do this quickly if we want to stay off of their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
Sir, we just spotted two men heading east on addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position about a mile down the road, and then start moving in.
We'll fan out and come in from behind.
You got it.
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner.
Let's move!
Come on, this way.
This way.
Where do we go now?
Weapons and ammunition.
- Get away from me!
- Get down!
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss!
I'm a federal agent.
Yeah, sure you are!
Get away from here!
Look, we need your help!
Go!
Now!
Okay, just relax.
I'm leaving!
Okay, I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon.
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
Paul!
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
Well, you should have been here to help us to stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or they get them, too?
Behind the counter, yeah.
Show me.
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're arab americans.
And we're good citizens.
We had nothing to do with what happened today!
Be quiet, Safah.
He doesn't care.
Look, take what you need, but leave us two guns.
We've chased the looters off once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
We needed to take cover.
What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys all electrical activity within an eight-mile radius.
So everything that's happened to us tonight-- the looting, the blackout-- it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks from happening.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
Commandos?
He's right.
You both need to leave this store.
Right now, we're their target.
You're not safe here with us.
Why don't you leave?
This is our store.
If I had a choice, I would!
You have weapons and shelter.
Right now, there is no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows we're in trouble.
They also know we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight we can force their commandos to use radio frequency to communicate their positions.
And CTU will pick up the signal?
Yes.
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage, and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here.
My brother and i talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property.
But this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years, we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighborhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
I agree.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from air force one.
Keep me informed.
I have an update on the damage from the san gabriel island meltdown.
It's not quite as bad as we had feared.
How are you doing?
Sit down.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple of hours ago when we thought that Paul was somehow involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know, I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
Just... but you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before, is that it?
Something like that.
Could I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
Okay.
Um...
I don't have much time.
You're aware i was falsely accused of leaking information earlier today.
Yes, I saw the report.
Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Or leave a memo?
Her daughter died today.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand.
But there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
Well, she promised the accusation would be expunged from my record and I'd be bumped up two pay grades as compensation, so I just want to make sure that will still happen.
I'll look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU, I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
I need security to station one.
Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn'T.
Oh, so you're firing me?
You can't do that.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Miss Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
- Is the back entrance locked?
- Yeah.
Put one of these in each window.
Have extra ammunition standing by.
Then I want you to get two hunting vests, fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms. Gavin won't be working with us anymore.
I'll need the two of you to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin as it is.
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already or not qualified to replace her.
You may want to reconsider.
No, I don't trust her.
Then what about agent Almeida?
Michelle, we can use the help and he's already proven himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
You'll be working with agent Stiles and manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, I need you to call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
Okay.
I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes.
Give me an update first.
The zone is still pretty quiet, except for emergency vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU's tact teams are standing by.
But the best we can do is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams.
Be ready to meet strength with strength.
And where would you place them?
At the McLennan-Forster building.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's going to help us by starting a fire fight.
I know the way he thinks.
Now the hostiles are going to have to break radio silence when they attack.
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is.
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's going to expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the original plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive an attack.
If we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
Team leader, this is specter.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of stringer, between flower and third.
He's not returning fire.
Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
What do we do?
Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
Audrey?
Yes?
Could you let dod know that we've piggybacked onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone?
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds.
So you don't need them any more?
No.
All right, no problem.
Um, look, I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm, you have to be decisive.
I understand.
And I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but... but what?
I think that you should re-evaluate your professional opinion of Tony.
Why's that?
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
And he went to the one person that he knew would come through for him and that was Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
I didn't know that.
After that, we just spent a couple hours with him.It's true
Tony does have a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does and I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside... he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that... just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronize me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously.
Don't worry
I'm going to tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
These guys are going to be here any minute.
You sure you both want to do this?
Yeah.
My brother and I, we're more angry about these attacks today than you are.
So we're going to stand up.
We're going to try and be part of the solution.
I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
He worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy.
But if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle just said that you were doing a search on possible ties to Marwan.
May I help?
Do you have a sign-on for the Zeitgeist server?
In washington?
Yeah, it would save me time if I could use it on this search.
Yeah.
There you go.
Thanks.
Anything else?
It should kick off a few names.
You can help me run them down once it's done searching.
Okay, great.
So, um... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
I said that Jack called you.
Anything else?
Well, I didn't say you that were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So, uh, how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
A lot different than Washington.
Yeah, it is different.
To tell you the truth, I couldn't believe it when
I heard that Jack had taken a desk job in D.C.
He said he was happier this way.
Well, you've gotten the chance to see him in both worlds today.
You think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through, do you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them!
See those signals underground?
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency.
That's because they're planning an attack.
They converged on a location on flower and third, about a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right, he's actually drawing them in.
Sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo one, move in.
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire at the site of the radio transmission.
How much longer before our teams get there?
The ground teams are closest.
They'll get there first.
When?
At least five or six minutes.
Who's helping him?
I don't know.
They've got to be civilians.
We need to end this quickly and get that document.
Is that understood?
Yeah.
I understand.
Let's go.
Raji!
Hey, raji!
Hey, hey, raji?
You okay?
Raji?
Hey, look it.
Fall back!
Hurry, take my shotgun.
Okay, because of the night vision goggles if they get within ten feet of you, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
Okey.
Jack!
Jack!
The gunfire stopped.
The teams on site?
Not yet.
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location.
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul.
Get in touch with the teams.
I'll update division.
If McLennan-Forster win the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
CTU personnel are approaching the location.
CTU, this is Castle, we're about to engage.
How many hostiles have been sighted?
Six down outside, unknown number inside.
Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul still alive?
Unknown at this point.
All right, look, the hostiles cannot be allowed to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennan-Forster.
Do you understand?
We'll do the best we can.
No, lee, listen to me.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing is about.
Roger that.
Jack!
Yeah?
I'm here!
You and Raines safe?
Yeah.
All hostiles are down.We're clear.
Copy.
This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
Curtis.
Curtis, this is castle.
Yeah, Lee.
What's your status?
The location is secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
What about their information?
Unknown at this point.
All right, keep this line open.
Jack's okay.
The team's secured the store.
What about Paul?
Yeah, he's with them.
Does Jack have anything from McLennan-Forster?
We don't know yet.
They're still cleaning up the area.
All right, stay in touch with the team.
Whatever they get from Jack, be ready to work up.
You got it.
Yeah, Dan.
You want people to help?
No, no, my people will take care of that when we sift through the data.
All right, you sure you don't need it?
Yeah.
All right
Yeah.
Okay.
Jack and Paul are okay.
What about the information?
We don't know if Jack has it yet.
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going to bring us any closer to finding Marwan.
Well, we know that McLennan-Forster is involved.
That should yield some leads.
Well, it's going to have to be worked up here, because
McLennan-Forster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No, you know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier, about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now... let's just say that I've been better, and, um... quite frankly, seeing you here today, um, has only made things worse.
look, I'm going to leave and get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together.
We'd appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
I also want you to set up a detail.
Five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me?
Jack!
Look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
Medic!
Come on, stay with me.
Come on, Paul, Stay with me.
No, no, Paul.
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me, okay?
Jack.
Ok, the medic is here.
Jack, let the medic do the work.
Any problems?
No, I'm here.
Are we on schedule?
Yes.
What about you?
I'm leaving now.
The president of the united states is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.
Previously On 24
Here are all the access codes for CTU and division.
Thanks.
I'm probably gonna be gone a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
Excuse me, sir.
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.
Tony, I want to thank you for filling in.
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.
Who?
Michelle Dessler, do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
Why there?
It turns out the man we're looking for works there.
Need to get into their computer system?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employee, a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack and the theft of the override device.
We need you to take your I.T.Systems off-line so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
Damn it.
What's he doing?
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch,It's encrypted.
That's it.
Print it out, now!
Now!
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb, we have to use it, now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried.
I'm going to try and stop it.
If I don't, I want you to take the hard copy and try to meet me in the front of the building.
A CTU agent is heading down near you.
Don't let him anywhere near it!
Oh, my god.
The following takes place between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.
Our any electronic device is working in that area?
Only the battery power device.
How many square miles were affected by the blackout?
Approximately, eight.
The southeast quadrant of downtown.
Okay, hold your position until the readings stabilize.
Copy that.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
Once the pulse bomb went off, we lost all communication with them.
What was the last word we heard from them?
Well, Jack and Paul found something.
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So that's why they set off the EMP, to destroy the evidence.
That'd be my guess.
This doesn't make sense.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking aggressive action, is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis, could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation?
No, an EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
Call me when he talks.
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!
I said drop it!
Paul?
Where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've got to get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
It's here.
Take a seat.
Where is it?
Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
Is this it?
Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
I don't think I could have held out much longer.
You did great.
Let's go.
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU, effective immediately.
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here.
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed?
Yes, sir.
Less than an hour ago we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term Employee of McLennan-Forster the third largest defense contractor in the country.
Now we know that Marean's been using the alias Harris Barnes.
What we don't know yet, is how he managed to evade their security checks.
Marwan knows we're looking for him, so he's probably gone dark.
But his association with McLennan-Forster has become our primary focus.
Jack Bauer and Paul raines went to the company to inspect his computer files.
But as they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated wiping out the company's entire database.
It also fried every electrical device within an eight-mile radius.
Streetlights, computers, cars, cell phones, everything.
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation?
Yes, but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast.
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks
Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.
Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
Not yet.
Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided, we'll send two teams in with fully-functional electronics.
The only problem is, until we find Jack and
Paul, they're not going to be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul raines.
But the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony?
I need the access codes for CTU and division.
Thank you.
What do you want me to do?
Division is sending over a supplemental list of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan.
I want you to check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, it doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done.
And I'd like you to do it.
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could be vital in helping us end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle... the last time I saw you, you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
A level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now, all you need is three.
Is there a problem with agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
I know your history.
I know that you guys were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
But if this is going to be a problem... his being here will not affect my work.
I won't let it.
Now, if secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD, indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire, stores have been ransacked, shots were heard.
There may even be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
Shots were heard?
That could be the same people that are after Jack.
I don't get it.
What information could Jack have found that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something that implicates McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if there's proof that they helped Marwan with today's attacks.
This is Anderson.
It is time for you to go.
Marean, your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
Are you ready?
Yes, of course.
How long will it take you to get there?
Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
The helicopter's heading to McLennan-Forster, and it's not responding to any of our id requests.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
There's a chopper flying through the dead zone, not one of ours.
Police?
No.
Not one of theirs either, I checked.
We wouldn't have picked it up if it wasn't for its electronic signature.
Where's it going?
Straight for McLennan-Forster.
Now, is it possible that it can be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
They would have given the police a call sign.
No, that's a search and destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men fully armed.
Who would have sent it?
Whoever set off the EMP.
They're going in after Jack and Paul.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
Be right back.
Jack, I can't do this.
Don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the two men we're looking for.
They have a document, a computer printout that's encoded.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware one of them is a CTU field agent.
You want us to kill a federal agent?
I'll take care of him personally.
He went bad.
Started helping the terrorists and dragged the company into it.
LAPD is beginning to respond to this area.
So we're going to have to do this quickly if we want to stay off of their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
Sir, we just spotted two men heading east on addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position about a mile down the road, and then start moving in.
We'll fan out and come in from behind.
You got it.
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner.
Let's move!
Come on, this way.
This way.
Where do we go now?
Weapons and ammunition.
- Get away from me!
- Get down!
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss!
I'm a federal agent.
Yeah, sure you are!
Get away from here!
Look, we need your help!
Go!
Now!
Okay, just relax.
I'm leaving!
Okay, I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon.
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
Paul!
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
Well, you should have been here to help us to stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or they get them, too?
Behind the counter, yeah.
Show me.
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're arab americans.
And we're good citizens.
We had nothing to do with what happened today!
Be quiet, Safah.
He doesn't care.
Look, take what you need, but leave us two guns.
We've chased the looters off once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
We needed to take cover.
What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys all electrical activity within an eight-mile radius.
So everything that's happened to us tonight-- the looting, the blackout-- it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks from happening.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
Commandos?
He's right.
You both need to leave this store.
Right now, we're their target.
You're not safe here with us.
Why don't you leave?
This is our store.
If I had a choice, I would!
You have weapons and shelter.
Right now, there is no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows we're in trouble.
They also know we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight we can force their commandos to use radio frequency to communicate their positions.
And CTU will pick up the signal?
Yes.
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage, and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here.
My brother and i talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property.
But this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years, we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighborhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
I agree.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from air force one.
Keep me informed.
I have an update on the damage from the san gabriel island meltdown.
It's not quite as bad as we had feared.
How are you doing?
Sit down.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple of hours ago when we thought that Paul was somehow involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know, I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
Just... but you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before, is that it?
Something like that.
Could I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
Okay.
Um...
I don't have much time.
You're aware i was falsely accused of leaking information earlier today.
Yes, I saw the report.
Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Or leave a memo?
Her daughter died today.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand.
But there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
Well, she promised the accusation would be expunged from my record and I'd be bumped up two pay grades as compensation, so I just want to make sure that will still happen.
I'll look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU, I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
I need security to station one.
Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn'T.
Oh, so you're firing me?
You can't do that.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Miss Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
- Is the back entrance locked?
- Yeah.
Put one of these in each window.
Have extra ammunition standing by.
Then I want you to get two hunting vests, fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms. Gavin won't be working with us anymore.
I'll need the two of you to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin as it is.
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already or not qualified to replace her.
You may want to reconsider.
No, I don't trust her.
Then what about agent Almeida?
Michelle, we can use the help and he's already proven himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
You'll be working with agent Stiles and manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, I need you to call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
Okay.
I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes.
Give me an update first.
The zone is still pretty quiet, except for emergency vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU's tact teams are standing by.
But the best we can do is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams.
Be ready to meet strength with strength.
And where would you place them?
At the McLennan-Forster building.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's going to help us by starting a fire fight.
I know the way he thinks.
Now the hostiles are going to have to break radio silence when they attack.
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is.
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's going to expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the original plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive an attack.
If we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
Team leader, this is specter.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of stringer, between flower and third.
He's not returning fire.
Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
What do we do?
Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
Audrey?
Yes?
Could you let dod know that we've piggybacked onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone?
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds.
So you don't need them any more?
No.
All right, no problem.
Um, look, I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm, you have to be decisive.
I understand.
And I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but... but what?
I think that you should re-evaluate your professional opinion of Tony.
Why's that?
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
And he went to the one person that he knew would come through for him and that was Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
I didn't know that.
After that, we just spent a couple hours with him.It's true
Tony does have a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does and I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside... he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that... just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronize me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously.
Don't worry
I'm going to tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
These guys are going to be here any minute.
You sure you both want to do this?
Yeah.
My brother and I, we're more angry about these attacks today than you are.
So we're going to stand up.
We're going to try and be part of the solution.
I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
He worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy.
But if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle just said that you were doing a search on possible ties to Marwan.
May I help?
Do you have a sign-on for the Zeitgeist server?
In washington?
Yeah, it would save me time if I could use it on this search.
Yeah.
There you go.
Thanks.
Anything else?
It should kick off a few names.
You can help me run them down once it's done searching.
Okay, great.
So, um... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
I said that Jack called you.
Anything else?
Well, I didn't say you that were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So, uh, how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
A lot different than Washington.
Yeah, it is different.
To tell you the truth, I couldn't believe it when
I heard that Jack had taken a desk job in D.C.
He said he was happier this way.
Well, you've gotten the chance to see him in both worlds today.
You think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through, do you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them!
See those signals underground?
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency.
That's because they're planning an attack.
They converged on a location on flower and third, about a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right, he's actually drawing them in.
Sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo one, move in.
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire at the site of the radio transmission.
How much longer before our teams get there?
The ground teams are closest.
They'll get there first.
When?
At least five or six minutes.
Who's helping him?
I don't know.
They've got to be civilians.
We need to end this quickly and get that document.
Is that understood?
Yeah.
I understand.
Let's go.
Raji!
Hey, raji!
Hey, hey, raji?
You okay?
Raji?
Hey, look it.
Fall back!
Hurry, take my shotgun.
Okay, because of the night vision goggles if they get within ten feet of you, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
Okey.
Jack!
Jack!
The gunfire stopped.
The teams on site?
Not yet.
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location.
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul.
Get in touch with the teams.
I'll update division.
If McLennan-Forster win the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
CTU personnel are approaching the location.
CTU, this is Castle, we're about to engage.
How many hostiles have been sighted?
Six down outside, unknown number inside.
Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul still alive?
Unknown at this point.
All right, look, the hostiles cannot be allowed to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennan-Forster.
Do you understand?
We'll do the best we can.
No, lee, listen to me.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing is about.
Roger that.
Jack!
Yeah?
I'm here!
You and Raines safe?
Yeah.
All hostiles are down.We're clear.
Copy.
This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
Curtis.
Curtis, this is castle.
Yeah, Lee.
What's your status?
The location is secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
What about their information?
Unknown at this point.
All right, keep this line open.
Jack's okay.
The team's secured the store.
What about Paul?
Yeah, he's with them.
Does Jack have anything from McLennan-Forster?
We don't know yet.
They're still cleaning up the area.
All right, stay in touch with the team.
Whatever they get from Jack, be ready to work up.
You got it.
Yeah, Dan.
You want people to help?
No, no, my people will take care of that when we sift through the data.
All right, you sure you don't need it?
Yeah.
All right
Yeah.
Okay.
Jack and Paul are okay.
What about the information?
We don't know if Jack has it yet.
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going to bring us any closer to finding Marwan.
Well, we know that McLennan-Forster is involved.
That should yield some leads.
Well, it's going to have to be worked up here, because
McLennan-Forster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No, you know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier, about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now... let's just say that I've been better, and, um... quite frankly, seeing you here today, um, has only made things worse.
look, I'm going to leave and get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together.
We'd appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
I also want you to set up a detail.
Five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me?
Jack!
Look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
Medic!
Come on, stay with me.
Come on, Paul, Stay with me.
No, no, Paul.
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me, okay?
Jack.
Ok, the medic is here.
Jack, let the medic do the work.
Any problems?
No, I'm here.
Are we on schedule?
Yes.
What about you?
I'm leaving now.
The president of the united states is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.
Here are all the access codes to CTU and Division.
- Thanks.
- I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
Sir, Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.
Tony, thank you for filling in.
And I'd like you to stick around and assist Ms Dessler.
- Who?
- Michelle Dessler.
Do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?
Turns out the man we're looking for works there.
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.
OK.
I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employees, Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, a terrorist responsible for today's attack and theft of the override.
We need you to take your IT systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
- Dammit!
- What's he doing?
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch, it's encrypted.
That's it.
Print it out, now.
Now!
He's gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb.
We have to use it now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that's electrical gets fried.
I'm gonna try and stop it.
If I don't, take the hard copy, meet me in front of the building.
CTU agent's heading down near you.
Don't let him near it.
Oh, my God.
" Are any electronic devices working?
Only the basic battery-powered devices.
- How many square miles are affected?
- "80, including southeast downtown."
OK.
Hold your position until the readings stabilise.
- Any word from Jack or Paul?
- No.
Once the bomb went off we lost communication.
- What was the last we heard from them?
- Jack and Paul found something.
It must be incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So they set off the EMP to destroy the evidence.
That's my guess.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking action is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis.
- Could Jack or Paul have been injured?
- No.
An EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
- Call me when he talks.
- Yes, sir.
" No!
" Drop your gun or I'll kill him.
I said drop it!
Paul, where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's in here.
Take a seat.
- Where is it?
- Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
- I couldn't have held out much longer.
- You did great.
Let's go.
For those who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU effective immediately.
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until she got here.
Why don't you bring everyone up to speed?
Yes, sir.
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks,
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster, the third-largest defence contractor in the country.
We know that Marwan's been using the alias "Harris Barnes".
What we don't know is how he evaded their security checks.
He knows we're after him so he's probably gone dark.
His association with McLennan-Forster is our main focus.
Jack and Paul Raines went to inspect his computer files, but as they were doing so, an EMP bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's database.
It fried every electrical device in an eight-mile radius - streetlights, computers, cars, cellphones, everything.
Did they find anything before detonation?
Yeah, but we haven't been able to contact them.
But we have to assume whoever detonated the EMP wants Jack and Paul eliminated.
- Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
- Not yet.
Once the effects subside we'll send two teams in with functioning electronics.
The problem is until we find Jack and Paul, they won't be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines, but the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony.
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.
- Thank you.
- What do you want me to do?
Division's sending over a supplemental list of terrorists who've had contact with Marwan.
Check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done and I'd like you to do it.
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle!
When I last saw you, you couldn't stay sober to keep ajob.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
Level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now, all you need is three.
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
I know your history, I know you were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
- But if this is gonna be a problem, I...
- His being here will not affect my work.
Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving reports from LAPD indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked-out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire and stores ransacked.
Witnesses report shots were heard.
There may be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
That could be the same people that were after Jack.
I don't get it.
What could be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something implicating McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if they helped Marwan today.
- This is Anderson.
- " It's time for you to go."
Marwan, your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, of course.
- "How long will it take you to get there?"
- Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
" It's heading to McLennan-Forster.
It's not responding to any of our ID requests.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
Excuse me.
There's a chopper in the dead zone, not one of ours.
- Police?
- Not one of theirs either.
I checked.
We picked it up by its electronic signature.
- Where's it going?
- Straight to McLennan-Forster.
Could it be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
- They'd give the police a call sign.
- It's a search-and-destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men, fully armed.
- Who would have sent it?
- Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
I'll be right back.
- Jack, I can't do this.
- You don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the men we're looking for.
They have an encoded computer print-out.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware, one of them is a CTU field agent.
- You want us to kill a federal agent?
- I'll take care of him.
He went bad, helped the terrorists, dragged the company into it.
LAPD is responding to this area.
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to stay off their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
" We spotted two men headed east on Addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position a mile down the road and then move in.
- We'll fan out and come in from behind.
- You got it.
Get me that chopper back in the northwest corner.
Let's move.
Come on.
" Come on, this way.
This way.
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.
- " Get away from here!
- Paul, get down!
" Get out of here!
The next one won't miss!
- I'm a federal agent.
- " Sure you are.
Get away from here.
Look, we need your help.
Go!
Now!
Hey, just relax.
I'm leaving.
OK?
I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon!
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
- Paul!
- Yeah?
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
You should have helped stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or did they get them too?
- Behind the counter, yeah.
- Show me.
Look, we're the first to be hit because we're Arabs.
- We had nothing to do with what happened...
- Quiet.
He doesn't care.
Take what you need, but leave two guns.
We chased the looters once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
- We needed to take cover.
- What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men chasing us caused this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys electrical activity within eight miles.
So everything that's happened, the looting, the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
- Commandos?
- He's right.
You need to leave this store.
Right now we're their target.
You're not safe here.
- Why don't you leave?
It's our store.
- If I had a choice, I would, but you have weapons and shelter.
Right now there's no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows that we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large-enough firefight, we can force their commandos to communicate their positions.
- And CTU will pick up the signal?
- Yes.
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage.
And we only have to hold down till CTU gets here.
...nothing, all right?
- All right.
My brother and I talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property, but this is notjust a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighbourhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
- Keep me informed.
- " Yes, sir."
I have an update from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.
It's not as bad as we had feared.
How you doing?
Sit down.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple hours ago, when we thought that Paul was involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know.
I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
I just...
But you're not sure you feel the same way as before, is that it?
Something like that.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
OK.
I don't have much time.
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information.
- Yes, I saw the report.
- Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Her daughter died.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand, but there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
She promised that it would be expunged from my record, and I'd be bumped up two pay grades, so I want to make sure that will still happen.
I'll look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.
I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
- I need security to station one.
- Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on theirjobs.
Yours isn't.
So you're firing me?
You can't.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
- Back entrance locked?
- Yeah.
Put these in each window.
Have ammunition ready.
And I want you to get two hunting vests.
Fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
I'll need you two to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin.
Everyone is up to their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.
- You may want to reconsider.
- No.
I don't trust her.
Then what about Agent Almeida?
Michelle, we could use the help, and he's already proved himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
Work with Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
- I'll advise internal stations of the change.
- " Give me an update.
It's quiet except for emergency-vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU teams are ready.
All we can do is spread them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams, meet strength with strength.
- Where would you place them?
- At McLennan-Forster.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
I know the way he thinks.
The hostiles will break radio silence when they attack.
We can follow the signal.
He's gonna engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.
But if we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
Castle, go ahead as planned.
Be ready to move.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
- OK.
- All right.
Team leader, this is Spectre.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer, between Flower and Third.
Copy that.
- He's not returning fire.
- Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
- And what do we do?
- Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
- Audrey.
- Yes?
Let DOD know we're using law-enforcement channels in the blackout zone.
- I told them we might need their feeds.
- You don't need them?
- No.
- All right, no problem.
I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just, when you walk into a hailstorm you have to be decisive.
I understand, and I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but...
But what?
I think that you should re-evaluate your opinion of Tony.
- Why is that?
- This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
He went to the one person he knew would come through for him
- Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
- I didn't know.
- We had to spend a couple hours with him.
It's true, Tony has a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does.
And I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside, he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronise me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say I will consider seriously.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
You scared?
- You sure you both want to do this?
- Yeah.
My brother and I are more angry about these attacks than you are.
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna try to be part of the solution.
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
- Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
And he worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy, but if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you, just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle said that you were doing a search on ties to Marwan.
May I help?
- Do you have a sign-on for the SYKY server?
- In Washington?
- Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
- Yeah.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Anything else?
- It should kick off a few names.
You can help me write them down once it's done searching.
So... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
- I said that Jack called you.
- Anything else?
I didn't say that you were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that, and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
- A lot different than Washington.
- Yeah.
It is different.
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Jack had taken a deskjob in DC.
He said he was happier this way.
Uh-huh.
Well, you've gotten a chance to see him in both worlds today.
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through today, you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them.
Each signal is a radio, all using the same frequency.
They're planning an attack.
They're at Flower and Third, a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right.
He's actually drawing them in.
" Go, go!
A sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo One, move in.
" The spread's picking up automatic-weapon fire.
- When will our teams get there?
- The ground teams will arrive first.
- When?
- At least five or six minutes.
- Who's helping them?
- I don't know.
They gotta be civilians.
We need to end this and get that document.
Understood?
- Yeah, I understand.
- Let's go.
Hey, Naji!
Hey!
Hey, are you hit?
Hey?
You OK?
Naji!
It hit the clip.
Naji.
" Fall back!
" All right!
Now!
Now!
" Move forward!
Hurry!
Take my shotgun.
Because of their night goggles, if they get within ten feet, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
" Jack?
Jack?
The gunfire's stopped.
- Are the teams on site?
- Not yet.
The commandos could have taken over the location.
They might have taken the information back.
Try to get in touch with our teams.
I'll update Division.
If McLennan-Forster won the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
- CTU personnel are approaching the location.
- "It's Castle.
We're about to engage."
- How many hostiles?
- "Six down outside.
Unknown inside."
- Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul alive?
- "Unknown at this point."
The hostiles cannot leave with the information from McLennan-Forster.
- You understand?
- "We'll do our best."
No.
Listen.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing's about.
Roger that.
- " Jack!
- Yeah?
I'm here.
- You safe?
- Yeah.
- All hostiles are down.
We're clear.
- OK.
" Go ahead.
This way.
- This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
- " Stand by."
- Curtis.
- "It's Castle."
- Lee, what's your status?
- Location secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
- What about their information?
- Unknown at this point.
Keep this line open.
Jack's OK.
The team secured the store.
- What about Paul?
- He's with him.
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?
- We don't know yet.
Stay in touch.
Whatever they get, be ready to work up.
You got it.
" Yeah?
- " You want us to help process?"
- No.
We'll do it when we sift the data.
- " Sure that's not a problem?"
- Yeah.
- "All right.
We'll wait for your confirmation."
- Yeah.
OK.
- Jack and Paul are OK.
- What about the information?
We don't know.
Even if Jack has it, we don't know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.
McLennan-Forster's involvement should yield some leads.
That will have to be worked up here.
Their computers were knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No.
You know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now...
Let's just say that I've been better.
Quite frankly, seeing you here today has only made things worse.
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair and let you do yourjob, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'll make sure you get help putting the store together.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
Set up a detail, five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store.
Understand?
Jack, look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul!
Medic!
Come on.
Just stay with me.
Come on, Paul, stay with me.
No, no.
Paul!
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me.
" Jack, it's OK.
The medic's here.
Jack, let the medics do their work.
- Any problems?
- No, I'm here.
- Are we on schedule?
- Yes.
- What about you?
- I'm leaving now.
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.

Here are all the access codes to CTU and Division.
- Thanks.
- I'm probably gonna be gone for a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
(Sarah) Sir, Ms Driscoll's replacement arrived.
Tony, thank you for filling in.
And I'd like you to stick around and assist Ms Dessler.
- Who?
- Michelle Dessler.
Do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
- I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
- Why there?
Turns out the man we're looking for works there.
- Need to get into their computer system?
- Yeah.
OK.
I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employees, Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, a terrorist responsible for today's attack and theft of the override.
We need you to take your IT systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.

Print it out, now.
Now!
He's gonna find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb.
We have to use it now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that's electrical gets fried.
I'm gonna try and stop it.
If I don't, take the hard copy, meet me in front of the building.
CTU agent's heading down near you.
Don't let him near it.
Oh, my God.
(yells)
(Curtis) Are any electronic devices working?
(man) Only the basic battery-powered devices.
- How many square miles are affected?
- 80, including southeast downtown.
OK.
Hold your position until the readings stabilise.
- Any word from Jack or Paul?
- No.
Once the bomb went off we lost communication.
- What was the last we heard from them?
- Jack and Paul found something.
It must be incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So they set off the EMP to destroy the evidence.
That's my guess.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking action is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis.
- Could Jack or Paul have been injured?
- No.
An EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
- Call me when he talks.
- Yes, sir.
(Paul) No!
(screams)
(screams)
(man) Drop your gun or I'll kill him.
I said drop it!
Paul, where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've gotta get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
Let's go.
It's in here.
Take a seat.
- Where is it?
- Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
- I couldn't have held out much longer.
- You did great.
Let's go.
For those who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU effective immediately.
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until she got here.
Why don't you bring everyone up to speed?
Yes, sir.
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks,
Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster, the third-largest defence contractor in the country.
We know that Marwan's been using the alias "Harris Barnes".
What we don't know is how he evaded their security checks.
He knows we're after him so he's probably gone dark.
His association with McLennan-Forster is our main focus.
Jack and Paul Raines went to inspect his computer files, but as they were doing so, an EMP bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's database.
It fried every electrical device in an eight-mile radius - streetlights, computers, cars, cellphones, everything.
Did they find anything before detonation?
Yeah, but we haven't been able to contact them.
But we have to assume whoever detonated the EMP wants Jack and Paul eliminated.
- Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
- Not yet.
Once the effects subside we'll send two teams in with functioning electronics.
The problem is until we find Jack and Paul, they won't be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines, but the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony.
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.
- Thank you.
- What do you want me to do?
Division's sending over a supplemental list of terrorists who've had contact with Marwan.
Check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done and I'd like you to do it.
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle!
When I last saw you, you couldn't stay sober to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
Level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now, all you need is three.
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
I know your history, I know you were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
- But if this is gonna be a problem, I...
- His being here will not affect my work.
Now, if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving reports from LAPD indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked-out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire and stores ransacked.
Witnesses report shots were heard.
There may be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
That could be the same people that were after Jack.
I don't get it.
What could be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something implicating McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if they helped Marwan today.
(phone rings)
- This is Anderson.
- (Marwan) It's time for you to go.
Marwan, your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, of course.
- How long will it take you to get there?
- Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
- (door opens) - (heavy breathing)
(helicopter overhead)
(Sarah) It's heading to McLennan-Forster.
It's not responding to any of our ID requests.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
Excuse me.
There's a chopper in the dead zone, not one of ours.
- Police?
- Not one of theirs either.
I checked.
We picked it up by its electronic signature.
- Where's it going?
- Straight to McLennan-Forster.
Could it be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
- They'd give the police a call sign.
- It's a search-and-destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men, fully armed.
- Who would have sent it?
- Whoever set off the EMP, they're after Jack.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
I'll be right back.
(helicopter overhead)
- Jack, I can't do this.
- You don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the men we're looking for.
They have an encoded computer print-out.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware, one of them is a CTU field agent.
- You want us to kill a federal agent?
- I'll take care of him.
He went bad, helped the terrorists, dragged the company into it.
LAPD is responding to this area.
We'll have to do this quickly if we want to stay off their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
(man) We spotted two men headed east on Addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position a mile down the road and then move in.
- We'll fan out and come in from behind.
- You got it.
Get me that chopper back in the northwest corner.
Let's move.
(shouting in background)
Come on.
(glass shatters)
( Jack) Come on, this way.
This way.
- Why are we going here?
- Weapons and ammunition.
- (man) Get away from here!
- Paul, get down!
(man) Get out of here!
The next one won't miss!
- I'm a federal agent.
- (man) Sure you are.
Get away from here.
Look, we need your help.
Go!
Now!
Hey, just relax.
I'm leaving.
OK?
I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon!
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
- Paul!
- Yeah?
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
You should have helped stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or did they get them too?
- Behind the counter, yeah.
- Show me.
Look, we're the first to be hit because we're Arabs.
- We had nothing to do with what happened...
- Quiet.
He doesn't care.
Take what you need, but leave two guns.
We chased the looters once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
- We needed to take cover.
- What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men chasing us caused this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys electrical activity within eight miles.
So everything that's happened, the looting, the blackout, it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
- Commandos?
- He's right.
You need to leave this store.
Right now we're their target.
You're not safe here.
- Why don't you leave?
It's our store.
- If I had a choice, I would, but you have weapons and shelter.
Right now there's no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
(whispering)
What's the plan?
CTU knows that we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large-enough firefight, we can force their commandos to communicate their positions.
- And CTU will pick up the signal?
- Yes.
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage.
And we only have to hold down till CTU gets here.
...nothing, all right?
- All right.
My brother and I talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property, but this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighbourhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
- Keep me informed.
- (man) Yes, sir.
I have an update from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.
It's not as bad as we had feared.
How you doing?
Sit down.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple hours ago, when we thought that Paul was involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know.
I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
I just...
But you're not sure you feel the same way as before, is that it?
Something like that.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
OK.
I don't have much time.
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information.
- Yes, I saw the report.
- Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Her daughter died.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand, but there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
She promised that it would be expunged from my record, and I'd be bumped up two pay grades, so I want to make sure that will still happen.
I'll look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU.
I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
- I need security to station one.
- Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn't.
So you're firing me?
You can't.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Ms Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
- Back entrance locked?
- Yeah.
Put these in each window.
Have ammunition ready.
And I want you to get two hunting vests.
Fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms Gavin won't be working with us any more.
I'll need you two to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin.
Everyone is up to their necks, or not qualified to replace Sarah.
- You may want to reconsider.
- No.
I don't trust her.
Then what about Agent Almeida?
Michelle, we could use the help, and he's already proved himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
Work with Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
- I'll advise internal stations of the change.
- (Michelle) Give me an update.
It's quiet except for emergency-vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU teams are ready.
All we can do is spread them around the perimeter and wait for Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams, meet strength with strength.
- Where would you place them?
- At McLennan-Forster.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's gonna help us by starting a firefight.
I know the way he thinks.
The hostiles will break radio silence when they attack.
We can follow the signal.
He's gonna engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's gonna expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive.
But if we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
Castle, go ahead as planned.
Be ready to move.
(shouting in background)
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
- OK.
- All right.
Team leader, this is Spectre.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer, between Flower and Third.
(radio) Copy that.
- He's not returning fire.
- Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
- And what do we do?
- Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
- Audrey.
- Yes?
Let DOD know we're using law-enforcement channels in the blackout zone.
- I told them we might need their feeds.
- You don't need them?
- No.
- All right, no problem.
I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just, when you walk into a hailstorm you have to be decisive.
I understand, and I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but...
But what?
I think that you should re-evaluate your opinion of Tony.
- Why is that?
- This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
He went to the one person he knew would come through for him
- Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
- I didn't know.
- We had to spend a couple hours with him.
It's true, Tony has a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does.
And I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside, he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronise me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say I will consider seriously.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
You scared?
- You sure you both want to do this?
- Yeah.
My brother and I are more angry about these attacks than you are.
So we're gonna stand up and we're gonna try to be part of the solution.
- I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
- Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
And he worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy, but if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you, just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle said that you were doing a search on ties to Marwan.
May I help?
- Do you have a sign-on for the SYKY server?
- In Washington?
- Yeah, it would save me time on this search.
- Yeah.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Anything else?
- It should kick off a few names.
You can help me write them down once it's done searching.
So... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
- I said that Jack called you.
- Anything else?
I didn't say that you were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that, and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
- A lot different than Washington.
- Yeah.
It is different.
To tell the truth, I couldn't believe it when I heard that Jack had taken a desk job in DC.
He said he was happier this way.
Uh-huh.
Well, you've gotten a chance to see him in both worlds today.
Think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through today, you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them.
Each signal is a radio, all using the same frequency.
They're planning an attack.
They're at Flower and Third, a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right.
He's actually drawing them in.
(commando) Go, go!
A sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo One, move in.
(Edgar) The spread's picking up automatic-weapon fire.
- When will our teams get there?
- The ground teams will arrive first.
- When?
- At least five or six minutes.
- Who's helping them?
- I don't know.
They gotta be civilians.
We need to end this and get that document.
Understood?
- Yeah, I understand.
- Let's go.
Hey, Naji!
Hey!
Hey, are you hit?
Hey?
You OK?
Naji!
It hit the clip.
Naji.
( Jack) Fall back!
(commando) All right!
Now!
Now!
(commando #2) Move forward!
Hurry!
Take my shotgun.
Because of their night goggles, if they get within ten feet, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
(Paul) Jack?
Jack?
The gunfire's stopped.
- Are the teams on site?
- Not yet.
The commandos could have taken over the location.
They might have taken the information back.
Try to get in touch with our teams.
I'll update Division.
If McLennan-Forster won the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
- CTU personnel are approaching the location.
- It's Castle.
We're about to engage.
- How many hostiles?
- Six down outside.
Unknown inside.
- Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul alive?
- Unknown at this point.
The hostiles cannot leave with the information from McLennan-Forster.
- You understand?
- We'll do our best.
No.
Listen.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing's about.
Roger that.
(helicopter approaches)
- (Castle) Jack!
- Yeah?
I'm here.
- You safe?
- Yeah.
- All hostiles are down.
We're clear.
- OK.
(agent) Go ahead.
This way.
- This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
- (man) Stand by.
(phone rings)
- Curtis.
- It's Castle.
- Lee, what's your status?
- Location secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
- What about their information?
- Unknown at this point.
Keep this line open.
Jack's OK.
The team secured the store.
- What about Paul?
- He's with him.
- Has he anything from McLennan-Forster?
- We don't know yet.
Stay in touch.
Whatever they get, be ready to work up.
You got it.
(Michelle) Yeah?
- (man) You want us to help process?
- No.
We'll do it when we sift the data.
- (man) Sure that's not a problem?
- Yeah.
- All right.
We'll wait for your confirmation.
- Yeah.
OK.
- Jack and Paul are OK.
- What about the information?
We don't know.
Even if Jack has it, we don't know that it'll bring us any closer to Marwan.
McLennan-Forster's involvement should yield some leads.
That will have to be worked up here.
Their computers were knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No.
You know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now...
Let's just say that I've been better.
Quite frankly, seeing you here today has only made things worse.
Look, I'm gonna leave, get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'll make sure you get help putting the store together.
I appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Lee, I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
Set up a detail, five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store.
Understand?
Jack, look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul!
Medic!
Come on.
Just stay with me.
Come on, Paul, stay with me.
No, no.
Paul!
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me.
(Castle) Jack, it's OK.
The medic's here.
Jack, let the medics do their work.
(phone rings)
- Any problems?
- No, I'm here.
- Are we on schedule?
- Yes.
- What about you?
- I'm leaving now.
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.

Here are all the access codes for CTU and division.
Thanks.
I'm probably gonna be gone a while.
If you need anything, you can always call me at home.
Excuse me, sir.
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.
Tony, I want to thank you for filling in.
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.
Who?
Michelle Dessler, do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
I have to go to McLennanForster.
Why there?
It turns out the man we're looking for works there.
Need to get into their computer system?
Yeah.
Okay, I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employee, a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack and the theft of the override device.
We need you to take your I.T.Systems offline so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
Damn it.
What's he doing?
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch,It's encrypted.
That's it.
Print it out, now!
Now!
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb, we have to use it, now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off, everything within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried.
I'm going to try and stop it.
If I don't, I want you to take the hard copy and try to meet me in the front of the building.
A CTU agent is heading down near you.
Don't let him anywhere near it!
Oh, my god.
The following takes place between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.
Our any electronic device is working in that area?
Only the battery power device.
How many square miles were affected by the blackout?
Approximately, eight.
The southeast quadrant of downtown.
Okay, hold your position until the readings stabilize.
Copy that.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
Once the pulse bomb went off, we lost all communication with them.
What was the last word we heard from them?
Well, Jack and Paul found something.
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennanForster.
So that's why they set off the EMP, to destroy the evidence.
That'd be my guess.
This doesn't make sense.
The fact that McLennanForster is taking aggressive action, is evidence against them.
Yeah, but it's not proof.
Curtis, could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation?
No, an EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
Call me when he talks.
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!
I said drop it!
Paul?
Where's the data printout?
I hid it in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've got to get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
It's here.
Take a seat.
Where is it?
Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
Is this it?
Yeah, it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
I don't think I could have held out much longer.
You did great.
Let's go.
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU, effective immediately.
Tony, I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here.
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed?
Yes, sir.
Less than an hour ago we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks
Habib Marwan, has been a longterm Employee of McLennanForster the third largest defense contractor in the country.
Now we know that Marean's been using the alias Harris Barnes.
What we don't know yet, is how he managed to evade their security checks.
Marwan knows we're looking for him, so he's probably gone dark.
But his association with McLennanForster has become our primary focus.
Jack Bauer and Paul raines went to the company to inspect his computer files.
But as they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated wiping out the company's entire database.
It also fried every electrical device within an eightmile radius.
Streetlights, computers, cars, cell phones, everything.
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation?
Yes, but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast.
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks
Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.
Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
Not yet.
Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided, we'll send two teams in with fullyfunctional electronics.
The only problem is, until we find Jack and
Paul, they're not going to be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul raines.
But the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennanForster.
That's all.
Tony?
I need the access codes for CTU and division.
Thank you.
What do you want me to do?
Division is sending over a supplemental list of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan.
I want you to check any names that have been flagged by other agencies, including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, it doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done.
And I'd like you to do it.
Michelle, Jack and Paul have information that could be vital in helping us end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle... the last time I saw you, you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
A level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now, all you need is three.
Is there a problem with agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflicts on the job.
I know your history.
I know that you guys were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
But if this is going to be a problem... his being here will not affect my work.
I won't let it.
Now, if secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it, I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD, indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire, stores have been ransacked, shots were heard.
There may even be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
Shots were heard?
That could be the same people that are after Jack.
I don't get it.
What information could Jack have found that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something that implicates McLennanForster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if there's proof that they helped Marwan with today's attacks.
This is Anderson.
It is time for you to go.
Marean, your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
Are you ready?
Yes, of course.
How long will it take you to get there?
Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
The helicopter's heading to McLennanForster, and it's not responding to any of our id requests.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm positive.
Michelle.
There's a chopper flying through the dead zone, not one of ours.
Police?
No.
Not one of theirs either, I checked.
We wouldn't have picked it up if it wasn't for its electronic signature.
Where's it going?
Straight for McLennanForster.
Now, is it possible that it can be some sort of corporate rescue chopper?
They would have given the police a call sign.
No, that's a search and destroy mission.
A chopper that size carries 20 men fully armed.
Who would have sent it?
Whoever set off the EMP.
They're going in after Jack and Paul.
McLennanForster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
Be right back.
Jack, I can't do this.
Don't have a choice.
Come on.
Get me some gear!
These are the two men we're looking for.
They have a document, a computer printout that's encoded.
We need to erase these two men and recover the document.
Just be aware one of them is a CTU field agent.
You want us to kill a federal agent?
I'll take care of him personally.
He went bad.
Started helping the terrorists and dragged the company into it.
LAPD is beginning to respond to this area.
So we're going to have to do this quickly if we want to stay off of their radar.
Use that to keep in touch.
Sir, we just spotted two men heading east on addison.
Deploy your men in a flanking position about a mile down the road, and then start moving in.
We'll fan out and come in from behind.
You got it.
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner.
Let's move!
Come on, this way.
This way.
Where do we go now?
Weapons and ammunition.
Get away from me!
Get down!
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss!
I'm a federal agent.
Yeah, sure you are!
Get away from here!
Look, we need your help!
Go!
Now!
Okay, just relax.
I'm leaving!
Okay, I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon.
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
Paul!
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
Well, you should have been here to help us to stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or they get them, too?
Behind the counter, yeah.
Show me.
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're arab americans.
And we're good citizens.
We had nothing to do with what happened today!
Be quiet, Safah.
He doesn't care.
Look, take what you need, but leave us two guns.
We've chased the looters off once, but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
We needed to take cover.
What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys all electrical activity within an eightmile radius.
So everything that's happened to us tonightthe looting, the blackoutit's all because of the terrorists?
Yes, and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks from happening.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
Commandos?
He's right.
You both need to leave this store.
Right now, we're their target.
You're not safe here with us.
Why don't you leave?
This is our store.
If I had a choice, I would!
You have weapons and shelter.
Right now, there is no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows we're in trouble.
They also know we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennanForster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight we can force their commandos to use radio frequency to communicate their positions.
And CTU will pick up the signal?
Yes.
So you want to engage the McLennanForster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage, and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here.
My brother and i talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property.
But this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
I cannot guarantee your safety.
You don't understand.
For years, we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighborhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
I agree.
The president should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from air force one.
Keep me informed.
I have an update on the damage from the san gabriel island meltdown.
It's not quite as bad as we had feared.
How are you doing?
Sit down.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple of hours ago when we thought that Paul was somehow involved with the attacks, Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted, but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know, I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
Just... but you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before, is that it?
Something like that.
Could I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
Okay.
Um...
I don't have much time.
You're aware i was falsely accused of leaking information earlier today.
Yes, I saw the report.
Erin Driscoll didn't talk to you about it?
Or leave a memo?
Her daughter died today.
I think she has other things on her mind.
I understand.
But there are some things that still need to be handled.
What things?
Well, she promised the accusation would be expunged from my record and I'd be bumped up two pay grades as compensation, so I just want to make sure that will still happen.
I'll look into it, but not today.
What happened to me was an outrage.
If you don't do something to resolve it right now, I'll go directly to Secretary Heller.
Secretary Heller doesn't run CTU, I do.
And I am ordering you to go back to work.
Not until you assure me the false accusation will be expunged and my pay grade changed.
I need security to station one.
Security?
What for?
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn'T.
Oh, so you're firing me?
You can't do that.
You need me.
I'm juggling active protocols.
We'll manage.
Please escort Miss Gavin out of the building.
Make sure you get her access card.
You'll be sorry for this.
I promise you will.
Is the back entrance locked?
Yeah.
Put one of these in each window.
Have extra ammunition standing by.
Then I want you to get two hunting vests, fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms. Gavin won't be working with us anymore.
I'll need the two of you to divide her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin as it is.
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already or not qualified to replace her.
You may want to reconsider.
No, I don't trust her.
Then what about agent Almeida?
Michelle, we can use the help and he's already proven himself useful today.
Agent Almeida, please come to station six.
Yeah.
You'll be working with agent Stiles and manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar, I need you to call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
Okay.
I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes.
Give me an update first.
The zone is still pretty quiet, except for emergency vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU's tact teams are standing by.
But the best we can do is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack.
I think that's a mistake.
We should consolidate our teams.
Be ready to meet strength with strength.
And where would you place them?
At the McLennanForster building.
Jack won't be far from there.
Look, he knows we won't be able to find him without help.
He's going to help us by starting a fire fight.
I know the way he thinks.
Now the hostiles are going to have to break radio silence when they attack.
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is.
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
And he's going to expect us to be ready for it.
Stick with the original plan.
Cover the perimeter.
Michelle.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong, Jack and Paul won't survive an attack.
If we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
Team leader, this is specter.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of stringer, between flower and third.
He's not returning fire.
Because he's alone.
He's calling for backup now.
What do we do?
Wait for them to come full force.
Just stay ready.
Audrey?
Yes?
Could you let dod know that we've piggybacked onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone?
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds.
So you don't need them any more?
No.
All right, no problem.
Um, look, I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm, you have to be decisive.
I understand.
And I know where you're coming from.
I think that you're making the right decisions, but... but what?
I think that you should reevaluate your professional opinion of Tony.
Why's that?
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
And he went to the one person that he knew would come through for him and that was Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
I didn't know that.
After that, we just spent a couple hours with him.It's true
Tony does have a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does and I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Fair enough.
And business aside... he still cares about you.
I got those perimeter teams you asked for ready to go.
Thanks.
Tony, look, I just want you to know that... just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Don't patronize me, Michelle.
I'm not.
Look, you ran CTU for two years.
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously.
Don't worry
I'm going to tell you what I think whether you want to hear it or not, all right?
Good.
These guys are going to be here any minute.
You sure you both want to do this?
Yeah.
My brother and I, we're more angry about these attacks today than you are.
So we're going to stand up.
We're going to try and be part of the solution.
I'm sorry this had to happen in your store.
Yeah.
Our father left us this business when he died.
He worked his whole life to make a good name for himself in the community.
This store is his legacy.
But if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
Yeah.
They're here.
Tony, Michelle just said that you were doing a search on possible ties to Marwan.
May I help?
Do you have a signon for the Zeitgeist server?
In washington?
Yeah, it would save me time if I could use it on this search.
Yeah.
There you go.
Thanks.
Anything else?
It should kick off a few names.
You can help me run them down once it's done searching.
Okay, great.
So, um... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
I said that Jack called you.
Anything else?
Well, I didn't say you that were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that and I'm sure she couldn't care less.
So, uh, how are you and Jack faring with him out in the field today?
It's different.
A lot different than Washington.
Yeah, it is different.
To tell you the truth, I couldn't believe it when
I heard that Jack had taken a desk job in D.C.
He said he was happier this way.
Well, you've gotten the chance to see him in both worlds today.
You think he'll go back to wearing a suit?
After the hell Jack's been through, do you think he'd want to come back to this?
Some people are more comfortable in hell.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them!
See those signals underground?
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency.
That's because they're planning an attack.
They converged on a location on flower and third, about a quarter mile from McLennanForster.
You were right, he's actually drawing them in.
Sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo one, move in.
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire at the site of the radio transmission.
How much longer before our teams get there?
The ground teams are closest.
They'll get there first.
When?
At least five or six minutes.
Who's helping him?
I don't know.
They've got to be civilians.
We need to end this quickly and get that document.
Is that understood?
Yeah.
I understand.
Let's go.
Raji!
Hey, raji!
Hey, hey, raji?
You okay?
Raji?
Hey, look it.
Fall back!
Hurry, take my shotgun.
Okay, because of the night vision goggles if they get within ten feet of you, shine your flashlight in their eyes, it'll blind them.
Okey.
Jack!
Jack!
The gunfire stopped.
The teams on site?
Not yet.
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location.
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul.
Get in touch with the teams.
I'll update division.
If McLennanForster win the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
There's no way to tell.
CTU personnel are approaching the location.
CTU, this is Castle, we're about to engage.
How many hostiles have been sighted?
Six down outside, unknown number inside.
Lee, it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul still alive?
Unknown at this point.
All right, look, the hostiles cannot be allowed to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennanForster.
Do you understand?
We'll do the best we can.
No, lee, listen to me.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing is about.
Roger that.
Jack!
Yeah?
I'm here!
You and Raines safe?
Yeah.
All hostiles are down.We're clear.
Copy.
This is Castle.
Get me CTU.
Curtis.
Curtis, this is castle.
Yeah, Lee.
What's your status?
The location is secured.
Jack and Raines are safe.
What about their information?
Unknown at this point.
All right, keep this line open.
Jack's okay.
The team's secured the store.
What about Paul?
Yeah, he's with them.
Does Jack have anything from McLennanForster?
We don't know yet.
They're still cleaning up the area.
All right, stay in touch with the team.
Whatever they get from Jack, be ready to work up.
You got it.
Yeah, Dan.
You want people to help?
No, no, my people will take care of that when we sift through the data.
All right, you sure you don't need it?
Yeah.
All right
Yeah.
Okay.
Jack and Paul are okay.
What about the information?
We don't know if Jack has it yet.
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going to bring us any closer to finding Marwan.
Well, we know that McLennanForster is involved.
That should yield some leads.
Well, it's going to have to be worked up here, because
McLennanForster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
No, you know what?
You should probably let Curtis handle that.
All right, I will.
I shouldn't have said that earlier, about your drinking.
I was out of line.
I'm sorry.
You don't owe me an apology.
My life right now... let's just say that I've been better, and, um... quite frankly, seeing you here today, um, has only made things worse.
look, I'm going to leave and get out of your hair and let you do your job, all right?
No.
We can't afford to lose you.
Not today.
You're sure?
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure.
All right.
I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together.
We'd appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I need you to get this to CTU.
It needs to get decoded immediately.
I also want you to set up a detail.
Five of your best men.
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me?
Jack!
Look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
Medic!
Come on, stay with me.
Come on, Paul, Stay with me.
No, no, Paul.
Paul, stay with me.
Come on, look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me, okay?
Jack.
Ok, the medic is here.
Jack, let the medic do the work.
Any problems?
No, I'm here.
Are we on schedule?
Yes.
What about you?
I'm leaving now.
The president of the united states is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.
Here are all the access codes for CTU and Division.
Thanks.
I'm probably gonna be gone a while.
If you need anything,you can always call me at home.
Excuse me,sir.
Driscoll's replacement's arrived.
Tony,I want to thank you for filling in.
I'd like you to stick around and assist Miss Dessler.
Who?
Michelle Dessler, do you know her?
I used to be married to her.
I have to go to McLennan-Forster.
Why there?
It turns out the man we're looking for works there.
Need to get into their computer system?
Yeah.
Okay,I'll go with you.
So how can I help CTU?
One of your employees,a Harris Barnes, is actually Habib Marwan, one of the terrorists responsible for today's attack and the theft of the override device.
We need you to take your I.T. systems off-line so Paul can look into his directory.
CTU will subpoena those files.
They will find out the truth.
Damn it.
what you doing
He's trying to rebuild the files I deleted.
Look at this.
,... that's it..
Print it out,now!
Now!
He's going to find evidence we sold arms to terrorists.
The pulse bomb, we have to use it,now.
We're dealing with an EMP.
Once it goes off,everything within its radius that has an electrical component gets fried.
I'm going to try and stop it.
If I don't,
I want you to take the hard copy and try to meet me in the front of the building.
A CTU agent is heading down near you.
Don't let him anywhere near it!
Oh,my God.
the following takes place... are any elect only the...
How many square miles were affected by the blackout?
Approximately,eight.
The southeast quadrant of downtown.
Okay,hold your position until the readings stabilize.
Any word from Jack or Paul?
No.
Once the pulse bomb went off, we lost all communication with them.
What was the last word we heard from them?
Well,Jack and Paul found something.
It seems it must have been incriminating to McLennan-Forster.
So that's why they set off the EMP,to destroy the evidence.
That'd be my guess.
That'd be my guess.
The fact that McLennan-Forster is taking aggressive action, is evidence against them.
Yeah,but it's not proof.
Curtis,could Jack or Paul been injured from the detonation?
No,an EMP only damages electronics.
But it doesn't mean they're safe.
We know you printed a document before the EMP detonated.
Where is it?
It's up to you.
You decide when the pain stops.
Call me when he talks.
no
Drop the gun or I'll kill him!
I said drop it!
Paul?
Where's the data printout?
I hid it... in an office down the hallway.
I know you're hurt, but we've got to get it and get out of here.
Let's go.
It's here.
Take a seat.
Where is it?
Bottom drawer, under some folders.
I hid it because I thought I might be captured.
Is this it?
Yeah,it's in code.
I couldn't make any sense out of it.
We need to get it back to CTU.
I don't think I could have held out much longer.
You did great.
Let's go.
For those of you who don't know, this is Michelle Dessler.
She'll be taking over as acting director of CTU, effective immediately.
Tony,I appreciate you carrying the ball until Michelle got here.
Why don't you bring her and everyone else up to speed?
Yes,sir.
Less than an hour ago, we discovered that the man responsible for planning today's attacks,Habib Marwan, has been a long-term employee of McLennan-Forster, the third largest defense contractor in the country.
Now we know that Marwan's been using the alias Harris Barnes.
What we don't know yet, is how he managed to evade their security checks.
Marwan knows we're looking for him,so he's probably gone dark.
But his association with McLennan-Forster has become our primary focus.
Jack Bauer and Paul Raines went to the company to inspect his computer files.
But as they were doing so, an electromagnetic pulse bomb was detonated, wiping out the company's entire database.
It also fried every electrical device within an eight-mile radius.
Streetlights,computers,cars, cell phones,everything.
Were Jack and Paul able to find anything before detonation?
Yes,but we haven't been able to contact them since the blast.
We have to assume whoever detonated the EMP thinks Jack and Paul found something and wants them eliminated.
Have rescue teams been sent into the area?
Not yet.
Once we've confirmed that the affects have subsided, we'll send two teams in with fully-functional electronics.
The only problem is,until we find Jack and Paul, they're not going to be able to do much.
We want to do everything we can to find Jack Bauer and Paul Raines.
But the priority is to retrieve any information they found at McLennan-Forster.
That's all.
Tony?
I need the access codes for CTU and Division.
Thank you.
Division is sending over a supplemental list of terrorists that supposedly had contacts with Habib Marwan.
I want you to check any names that have been flagged by other agencies,including overseas.
Given what's happening right now, it doesn't seem like the best use of my time.
It has to be done.
And I'd like youto do it.
Michelle,Jack and Paul have information that could be vital in helping us end this crisis.
I should be helping us find them.
Michelle...
The last time I saw you, you couldn't stay sober long enough to keep a job.
That was six months ago.
This is what I need you to do.
If you don't like it, you can resign.
I'm gonna need a security clearance.
I'll make sure you get a level three.
A level three?
I used to have a six.
Right now,all you need is three.
Is there a problem with Agent Almeida?
Not at all.
It's just that Secretary Heller is very sensitive to personal conflictson the job.
I know your history.
I know that you guys were married and that he sacrificed his career to save your life.
But if this is going to be a problem...
His being here will not affect my work.
I won't let it.
Now,if Secretary Heller wants to speak to me about it,
I'll be more than glad to.
We are receiving preliminary reports from LAPD, indicating that there is widespread looting going on in the blacked out zone.
A number of cars have been set on fire, stores have been ransacked, shots were heard.
There may even be casualties.
We just don't know at this time.
Shots were heard?
That could be the same people that are after Jack.
I don't get it.
What information could Jack have found that would be worth setting off a pulse bomb?
Something that implicates McLennan-Forster.
Anything they're doing now is insignificant if there's proof that they helped Marwanwith today's attacks.
This is Anderson.
It is time for you to go.
Marwan,your face is all over the news.
Don't worry about it.
Things will proceed as planned.
Are you ready?
Yes,of course.
How long will it take you to get there?
Less than 30 minutes.
I'll inform the others.
The helicopter's heading to McLennan-Forster, and it's not responding to any of our ID requests.
You sure?
Yeah,I'm positive.
Michelle.
exuse me
There's a chopper flying through the dead zone, not one of ours.
Police?
No.
Not one of theirs either,I checked.
A chopper that size carries 20 menfully armed.
Who would have sent it?
Whoever set off the EMP.
They're going in after Jack and Paul.
McLennan-Forster's been training mercenaries for years.
Contact our field teams in the air.
Let them know about the intruding chopper.
Jack,I can't do this.
Don't have a choice.
Come on.
You got it.
Give me that chopper back on the northwest corner.
Let's move!
Come on,this way.
This way.
Where do we go now?
Weapons and ammunition.
Get away from me!
Get down!
Get out of here, or the next one won't miss!
I'm a federal agent.
Yeah,sure you are!
Get away from here!
Look,we need your help!
go!
now!
Okay,just relax.
I'm leaving!
Okay,I'm leaving.
Drop the weapon.
Now!
Kick the gun over to me.
Paul!
Get in here.
Pick up that gun.
My name is Jack Bauer.
I am a federal agent.
Well,you should have been here to help us to stop the looting.
You still have any rifles or they get them,too?
Behind the counter
Show me.
We're the first to be hit because everybody knows we're Arab Americans.
And we're good citizens.
We had nothing to do with what happened today!
Be quiet,Safah.
He doesn't care.
take what you need, but leave us two guns.
We've chased the looters off once,but they'll be back.
Just stay there.
Give me the keys.
What are you guys doing here?
We needed to take cover.
What do you mean?
Who's after you?
It has to do with the terrorist attacks.
I have critical evidence that I need to get to the authorities.
The men that are chasing us are responsible for this blackout.
They detonated a device called an electromagnetic pulse bomb.
It destroys all electrical activity within an eight-mile radius.
So everything that's happened to us tonight- the looting, the blackout- it's all because of the terrorists?
Yes,and the evidence that I have can help prevent further attacks from happening.
Jack, the commandos will be here any minute.
Commandos?
He's right.
You both need to leave this store.
Right now,we're their target.
You're not safe here with us.
Why don't you leave?
This is our store.
If I had a choice,I would!
You have weapons and shelter.
Right now,there is no other place for us to be.
Can I talk to my brother for a second?
Stay where I can see you.
What's the plan?
CTU knows we're in trouble.
They also know we can't contact them.
They can view this area with satellite and infrared.
McLennan-Forster's commandos arrived in a military helicopter.
CTU had to see that on satellite.
If we can initiate a large enough fire fight, we can force their commandos to use radio frequency to communicate their positions.
And CTU will pick up the signal?
yes
So you want to engage the McLennan-Forster army, just the two of us?
We have a positional advantage, and we only have to hold out until CTU gets here.
My brother and I talked about this.
We're staying.
I can't force you to leave your own property.
But this is not just a bunch of looters.
This is a very dangerous situation.
You don't understand.
For years,we've been blamed for the attacks by these terrorists.
We grew up in this neighborhood.
This country is our home.
If you're fighting the people who caused today's bloodshed, then we'll help you.
I agree.
The President should stay in the air at least another hour, if not longer.
If he wants to speak to the nation, he should do it from Air Force One.
Keep me informed.
I have an update on the damage from the San Gabriel Island meltdown.
It's not quite as bad as we had feared.
How are you doing?
sit down
Any word from Jack or Paul?
no
I can't imagine how hard this must be for you.
There's something else, isn't there?
A couple of hours ago, when we thought that Paulwas somehow involved with the attacks,
Jack questioned him.
And Paul has his pride, so he resisted,but...
Jack was pretty rough?
Very.
That's his job.
He had to make sure.
You have to believe that Jack had no choice.
I know,I guess it was just a shock to see it.
Somehow he seemed like a different person.
We need people like that, Audrey.
Jack is an incredible man.
Just...
But you're not sure you feel the same way as you did before,is that it?
Something like that.
Could I speak to you for a moment?
It's important.
Okay.
Um...
I don't have much time.
You're aware I was falsely accused of leaking information earlier today.
I need people whose minds are on their jobs.
Yours isn't.
Is the back entrance locked?
Yeah.
Okay.
Put one of these in each window.
Have extra ammunition standing by.
Then I want you to get two hunting vests, fill all the pockets with empty clips.
Go.
Ms. Gavin won't be workingwith us anymore.
...her workload.
We're stretched pretty thin as it is.
Everyone on the floor is up to their necks already or not qualified to replace her.
You may want to reconsider.
No,I don't trust her.
yeah
You'll be working with Agent Stiles and Manning for the rest of the day.
Edgar,I need you to call up Sarah's protocols.
Check the configuration, make sure they're accurate.
okay
I'll advise internal stations of the personnel changes.
Give me an update first.
The zone is still pretty quiet,except for emergency vehicle chatter.
There's no sign of Jack or Paul.
CTU's tact teams are standing by.
But the best we can do is spread them around the perimeter, and wait for some sign of Jack.
When they do, we can follow the signal straight to where he is.
He's going to deliberately engage an entire team of commandos?
It's the most efficient way to be found.
If we send all our teams to one location and you're wrong,
Jack and Paul won't survive an attack.
If we cover the perimeter, we may have a chance to save them.
Do it.
There's one of them.
It's time.
No one fires until I give the order.
ok
Team leader,this is Specter.
I was just shot at.
I'm on the northwest corner of Stringer,between Flower and Third.
Audrey?
yes?
Could you let DOD know that we've piggybacked onto local law enforcement channels in the blackout zone?
I told them earlier we might need to use their feeds.
So you don't need them any more?
-No.
All right,no problem.
Um,look,I didn't mean to be confrontational before.
Just... when you walk into a hailstorm, you have to be decisive.
I think that you should re-evaluate your professional opinion of Tony.
Why's that?
This morning Jack had nowhere to turn.
And he went to the one person that he knew would come through for him and that was Tony.
Tony saved our lives.
I didn't know that.
After that,we just spent a couple hours with him.
It's true,Tony does have a lot of issues, but he is good at what he does, and I think that we could use him on a day like today.
Thanks.
Tony,look,I just want you to know that... just because I overruled you a few minutes ago doesn't mean that I don't value your input.
Anything that you have to say, I will consider seriously.
Good.
guys
You sure you both want to do this?
Yeah.
My brother and I, we're more angry about these attacks today than you are.
But if he were here right now, he'd be standing next to you just as we are.
Just stay low and do what I tell you.
Thank you... for saving my life.
yeah
They're here.
Tony,Michelle just said that you were doing a search on possible ties to Marwan.
May I help?
Do you have a sign-on for the Zeitgeist server?
In Washington?
Yeah,it would save me time if I could use it on this search.
Yeah.
There you go.
Thanks.
Anything else?
It should kick off a few names.
You can help me run them down once it's done searching.
Okay,great.
So,um... did you tell Michelle what happened today?
I said that Jack called you.
Anything else?
Well,I didn't say you that were living with anyone, if that's what you mean.
She probably already knows that
A lot different than Washington.
Yeah,it is different.
Are you talking about Jack... or yourself?
I think we found them!
See those signals underground?
Each one's a radio, all using the same frequency.
That's because they're planning an attack.
They converged on a location on Flower and Third, about a quarter mile from McLennan-Forster.
You were right, he's actually drawing them in.
Sporting goods store, across the street.
Let's move.
Bravo One,move in.
Infrared is picking up automatic weapon fire at the site of the radio transmission.
How much longer before our teams get there?
The ground teams are closest.
They'll get there first.
When?
At least five or six minutes.
Who's helping him?
I don't know.
They've got to be civilians.
We need to end this quickly and get that document.
Is that understood?
Yeah.
I understand.
Let's go.
Raji!
Hey,Raji!
You okay?
Raji?
Fall back!
Okay,because of the night vision goggles, if they get within ten feet of you, shine your flashlight in their eyes,it'll blind them.
ok
Jack!
Jack!
The gunfire stopped.
The teams on site?
Not yet.
Without enforce the commandos could have taken over the location.
Which means they might have taken the information back from Jack and Paul.
Get in touch with the teams.
I'll update Division.
If McLennan-Forster win the firefight, what about Jack and Paul?
there is no way to tell
CTU personnel are approaching the location.
CTU,this is Castle, we're about to engage.
How many hostiles have been sighted?
Six down outside,unknown number inside.
Lee,it's Tony.
Are Jack and Paul still alive?
Unknown at this point.
All right,look,the hostiles cannot be allowed to leave the area with the information Jack took from McLennan-Forster.
Do you understand?
We'll do the best we can.
No,Lee,listen to me.
Failure is not an option.
That information is what this whole thing is about.
Roger that.
Jack!
Yeah?
I'm here!
You and Raines safe?
-Yeah.
All hostiles are down.
We're clear.
Copy.
Yeah,Dan.
No,no,my people will take care of that when we sift through the data.
Yeah.
Okay.
Jack and Paul are okay.
What about the information?
We don't know if Jack has it yet.
But even if he does, we don't know that he's going to bring us any closer to finding Marwan.
Well,we know that McLennan-Forster is involved.
That should yield some leads.
Well,it's going to have to be worked up here, because McLennan-Forster's computers were all knocked out by the EMP.
You want to head that up?
all right
I'm going to make sure you get some help putting the store back together.
I need you to get this to CTU.
Nothing happens to this store, do you understand me?
Jack!
Look out!
Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
Medic!
Come on,stay with me.
Come on,Paul.
Stay with me.
No,no,Paul.
Paul,stay with me.
Come on,look at me.
Look at me.
There you go.
Look at me.
I owed you.
You don't owe me anything.
Just stay with me,okay
Jack,let the medic do the work.
Any problems?
What about you?
I'm leaving now.
The President of the United States is on a tight schedule.
We can't be late.
Ê± ¼ä£ºf1_ralf
Here, my father was king
On the day he died, 17 years ago
I was 23, lonely and afraid
If I'd known then of the nightmare that laid ahead
I think I'd have chosen to die with him
Jason, I've had enough
Wait a minute, come on, you can't stop now.
You're young, fit
Any case, I've paid you in advance till midnight
- You are merciless
- Certainly, right, now let's go again
Now slowly, oops sorry, sorry
Jason, I'm cold, I'm tired and I want to go home
Alright, alright, now just calm down.
This is a perfect spot.
This is classic, right?
We're under a lamp
Now just close your eyes... close your eyes, relax... relax
Now I want you to think, I want you to think you're gonna meet your lover
Come on... that man that really gets your blood boiling
He's really hot, he makes you hot, alright?

Eh, I do believe you're laughing, eh?
That's lovely.
Now is that pressure or embarrassment?
I'm sorry
Ha, ha... got you, ha, ha...
Pfff... just like that, eh?
I'm off the board, and no more income?
I'm not even sure you can do this, you know?
Stephanie did leave very strict instructions
I am still her husband
It was decided in last week's directors meeting.
The vote was unanimous
I assure you, it's all perfectly legal, but get advice by all means
How come I wasn't informed the meeting was on?
You haven't attended one meeting in the last 12 months, Greg
Anyway, your presence there wouldn't have changed things
Damn it, there are bill to be paid
Staff salaries and household expenses will continue to be made by the company
Except of course, your personal expenses
Those from here on end, will be your responsibility
Oh, you can go on living at the house...
for the time being
You never approved of me marrying her, did you?
Well did you, you bastard!
I think this meeting's concluded
Go to hell
I'm not putting up with this anymore
You're drunk... again
Yes, yes I am.
They can blame me.
I'm not your whore, do you hear me?
Greg?
Where are you going?
- Out
- You come back here, Greg
Alright, alright, alright you can have the money, ok?
Anything you want
Please don't leave me alone tonight
Please...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, ok?
Honey I'm sorry
Please will you stay the night with me?
Please!
I'll fix us a drink
Ladies and gentlemen of the press
Hi, mighty new face in the fashion world

Now listen, on behalf of the Local Figures, I'd like to say welcome
Good grief
Wait a minute, Local Figures don't say "good grief"
Oh, really?
- Ah, they just say
- Ah, ah...
Sorry
Do you want this over your head?
No, no, she would you know?
I owe it all to you two.
I had to learn to walk all over again
I knew the day you came into my office, you had a different kind of quality a sort of... mysterious something, whatever.
Bloody original, darling
That's it you know?
The Sphinx... ageless
Its maturity and wisdom contradicted by a youthful facade.
That's a very potent mixture
Look, there's not one man here today, that hasn't been looking at you
Not you, mother
You really are a drewy little senator Do you mind?
Someone is gonna over-hear you one of these days and think I really am your mother
- No... impossible
-Joan, the clients are really getting restless
Oh, I'll be over in a second, I promise
Okay, what's going on?
I read your comments on the TV contract
You know, you really are incredible
I mean you pick up stuff on things that I question
Where on earth did you learn about contracts?
Just gut instinct, ok?
Well, if you ever decide to pack modeling in, there's always a job for you backstage
Can do with a good head around the place
Oh... sorry mother
Why have I put up with you these last three years?
Um... because I'm cute, and you fancy me girls
- Ah, ha!
- That'll be the day
No point trying to discuss anything serious in front of this boy
- Let's talk about it later
- Okay
Behave... and don't touch my champagne
Oh, oh, second, I'll take it with me
Goodnight sweetie
Know what?
I know your face, nearly as well as I know my own
Well I could light you, with a soft light, and diffuse it, and you'd look 21
If I used hard sunlight, you'd be... um... 35?
39?
Eh... these moments... still like the Sphinx isn't it?
internal beauty
Now that old girl, kept her secret for centuries, you know?
Good on her
Jason, you are a romantic and a cavalier
Well, that's my secret
Well, here's to us then, and well kept secrets
Wanna ride on my bike?
I'm going home
Oh hello Maxie, my boy, I know..
what's that?
Oh... gee...
I worked hard today my darling
I worked like a dog, I did
That was a joke Maxie.
You're supposed to laugh
Mmmm, have a nice day?
So, what do you think of your new house?
A bit expensive, but I reckon we've earned it
What do you think, mmm?
You know, we might find you a little lady friend
You'll just run off and leave me though.
I'll get lonely if you go and leave me.
You hungry?
oh, I'm so tired
I'm too old for all this Maxie I think that's my trouble
15 love
Had a good career.
Actually had a lot of promise when he was younger
Something went wrong ...he could drag himself out of bed, if you get my drift
Anyway, he blew it
This is love
Greg's an alley cat with a touch of class.
Then he married Mrs. Moneybag, Stephanie Harper.
You must have read about it
15 all
Will you look at them.
All having their private little fantasies about Greg Marsden
Not you too out
Are we here because of Greg Marsden?
40-30
No of course not, I've never even met him
I love the game, that's all
Ah, that's alright, I should play
We should get Jason to do some shots of you on the tennis court
Eh... not exactly vintage, is it?
He might as well have arrived naked
Yeah, what's your name?
Mr. Marsden has the reputation of being attracted by new faces
Beautiful ones, in the public eye I hear he thrives on challenge
Don't look now...
I can beat you to the honey pot
Hi there I'm Greg Marsden and I don't believe we've met
Morning Joanna.
Good grief!
Exactly what I said when I walked in
Are they for a layout?
They're for you, all of them.
Guess who?
I don't need to
What happened to you two last night?
I saw you leave with him
- He walked me to my car and...
drove home alone
-Car?
- What car
- My car
I bought it yesterday.
Red Beetle convertible.
They're chic.
Quite a bargain too
How terrific!
It's not a problem taking your clothes off, you know, I mean it's not abnormal, everyone here takes their clothes off They do it if I ask them.
It's quite natural
Hey guys, take your clothes off.
See?
Oh god, look we gotta get this shot done somehow
Buzz, light that camera will you please?
Joan you got another call
Oh, no more calls please.
Take messages
It's been chaos on here this morning.
Lines never stopped since I got in.
We were a big hit last night.
I think everyone in town's rang
Congratulations Joan, it's fantastic
Choo, choo... hay fever.
This stuff's gonna have to go.
They can't stay
I'm not in the mood, good morning
- Good morning
- Good morning
You know, if I knew you were interested in tennis, I would have bought a tennis racket
Don't let us stop you
Ah, listen mother... that model that you got me for today, she won't take her clothes off
Well, just ask her nicely
I did ask her nicely
You're just have to ask her nicely again
- He's absolutely mad
- You're not wrong
Oh Joan, that's great
Yes it is, isn't it?
Thought I might include that in the next collection
You're quite a workaholic, aren't you?
What about you and Greg Marsden?
What do you mean?
Oh, do you fancy him?
You must have a sex life!
You do have a sex life, don't you?
I mean all these months, I just presumed
I don't have time.
You know what it's like
You never stop amazing me
Most girls today are dizzy from playing musical beds and my top model has this quite old-fashioned attitude, that is positively middle age
Present company excepted of course!
Hey, that's what you're supposed to do.
Now that's not very difficult.
Is it?
Do you think it's as bad as that?
I'll even lend you my storing*
Hello

Sure

We hardly know one another
I feel I've known you a long time
Well what do you call it, umm... deja vu
Mr. Marsden, your table is ready
Thank you
Is there a boyfriend or husband in the picture?
There was someone once.
Someone I loved very much
A fairy tale prince that I dreamed about ever since I was a little girl
Oh, what happened?
The dream turned into a nightmare...
I woke up.
How about you?
Me?
Oh... no you don't.
It's not fair
Oh, come on.
Of course it's fair.

You remind me physically of Stephanie

You are the swan she always wanted to be

Phillip's away, I get lonely in an empty home
Yes, I know
Still, you do have Greg
Do I?
Yes, yes I do
He needs me
Greg is addictive, like this stuff
He told me a bit about his wife.
I gather you and she were best friends
Hm... since we were kids Our fathers knew one another
They did business
So I suppose it was her death that brought you and Greg together
Yeah, yeah it was
Oh
Thank you
- Cheers
- Cheers
Stephanie was a beer drinker
- So you were saying?
- What?
Oh... yeah, I know... um, I was about to say
Greg never really loved Stephanie
He told me
Though it wasn't like I was doing anything disloyal
When I fell in love with him
It was one of those things
Did Stephanie love Greg?
I suppose so, yeah it's my, what time is it?
Ten after seven
Seven?
Oh god, I've gotta go
Greg's waiting for me at the house
Did you drive here?
No, I took a taxi.
I always seem to be taking taxis these days
Well, I'll drive you home then

I gotta go now, he gets angry if I'm late
- That should be fun, thank you

Pleasure
Maybe I'll see you again.
Ring me.
I'm in the book
Yeah
The best time to catch me is in the mornings

You are getting to be quite famous
I think I must be the only doctor in North Queensland who buys copies of Vogue
You reading Vogue...
that I can't imagine
You know Tara, I've never seen you look lovelier
I warned you, you should have charged me more
No, I didn't just mean it in the physical sense
There's a new kind of ease
You're more confident, and that is not my doing
You had more than a bit to do with it
Are you happy?
Yes, I think so
I don't just mean your success
No, I know
How many men do you have in your life?
None
Well, I though about you... a great deal
Haven't told me what you're doing in Sydney yet
It's... it's just a medical conference but I'm really here to see you
Well, I couldn't just let you disappear
Something happen between us out there, didn't it?
Uhhh, I think they're ready
Where's the bathroom?
Through the bedroom, turn right

Well, you certainly have a great view
Yes, it is great
I've always loved Sydney harbour
Yeah, me too
Do you know, I've never been in Sandio Pass?
Oh, you should try it while you're here Dan
Salmon is during season at the moment
You love your music, don't you?
I think there've been times it actually saved my sanity
This looks terrific
Thank you
Thanks

Bon appetite
Hey!
I think it's time that I went

Jason, you must be ready for a reload
Haven't shot any yet
Give me five minutes
We just got this going
Anyone for tennis?
Hi
Why haven't you been answering my calls?
I've left messages all over town for you
Yes, I know, I'm sorry Greg.
I've been flat out
That's not an excuse
I really haven't had a moment ...of him before we lose the sun behind the clouds, Tara
- Who's he?
- A friend
How close a friend?
Not that close
We have a professional relationship, I also happen to like the man
- Do you want a coffee?
- I haven't got time
How about the weekend?
Haven't planned anything
Can we spend it at the house, with me?

I'm so sorry
It's fine, don't worry about it
Am I too late?
Oh, we can go in at the interval.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink
Oh Dan, I really love this opera, I didn't want to miss the first act
- What do you want to do?
- What do you want to do?
Let's go see it some other time.
Do you mind?
I don't mind what we do so long as I can sit down
Ok
This place always used to be so crowded
- Times change
- Really!
It was the old man's...
Yeah, he'd be here every day after work propping up the bar
Except for Sundays
My mom would come in at six, and she would drag him up to have his dinner
- Hi, I know you
- Hello Dot
Danny Marshall, course it must be 30 years
- Frank Marshall's boy
- Yeah
You wanted to be a doctor
I remember.
You'd always beg Jean...
Yeah, that's right Dot except now that's people
You mean you actually ended up being a real doctor?
- Huh, huh
- Well, fantastic
Dot, this is Tara
- Pleased to meet you
- And you
Danny Marshall, he was this high when I knew him ...he used to steal all the milk money in the street
Until I got caught in the act.
It scared the living daylights out of me
I never done it again
Look doc, I'm dying of thirst
I'll be with you in a minute
Beers are on the house
- Ah thanks
- Thank you
Hate these shoes
- Ah, aren't I just begging for your love?
- Cheers Dot
You know, we used to have a backyard that I could spit across in a strong wind
Every weekend through summer a mob of us kids would get into the harbour we'd dive for the pennies that were chucked in by the tourists
I guess the sharks must have felt sorry for us
Either that, or they weren't hungry
The old man use to brag about me to his mate Stanley
Then he'd say he's the bravest kid in the neighbourhood
Back then they kept them in cigarettes
I wish I had known you then, been able to dive for pennies with you
Still those fond memories
Don't turn the lights on
I can't
It's not the glamour of a successful model that attracts me
It's the warm, intelligent lady I met in Queensland who loves good music,
kids and owls... seashells
and I'll bet when she was little she was the bravest kid in the neighbourhood too
I love you Tara
I have endured these months
I'm sorry Dan
What is it?
Please, trust me
I do trust you
Trust me enough to tell me what's going on
We can't see one another again
I'm sorry.
It was unfair of me
Tara
No Dan.
Forgive me.
Goodbye
Tara
Too slow
It's too slow
Come on, concentrate Well get with it
- I'm sorry
- Yeah, you look sorry
I wonder, would you mind tilting your head back a little bit?
It could manage a little more?
Look, I don't know what is the matter with you today
I don't know where your mind is.
Well it certainly isn't here at work, is it?
I mean you got about as much spontaneity as a two year old corpse
Alright, kill that snow Kill the fucken snow
Ozzie, kill the snow
Ozzie put that bloody thing down
Now, switch it off
Now look, I'm a professional, and this is my profession and I have not got time to waste on amateurs
We all go home.
We're finished.
Go home
Well have a good long weekend, and make sure that you're here early Tuesday morning
I love you
Hello
Hi, sorry to wake you
Jilly
I need a favour
Where are you?
Jeroke Police Station.
Could you pick me up?
Yeah, ok.
I'll be there in... half an hour oh thanks, thanks so much
Alright
Bye
- I couldn't ring home
- It's alright
I'm so grateful to you
Now I left... call anyone when it happened
I used to have a lot of friends
Why didn't you ring Greg?
No, I couldn't
It's not the first time, you see
He gets violent when he's angry
It's been worse lately We haven't made love for weeks
I don't know what to do?
You know I've been, I've been giving him money since Stephanie died past few weeks I had to pay all his bills
You know, he can't treat me like this
I could tell a lot about Mr. Greg Marsden if I wanted
I can ruin him
Here it is.
What do you think?
What I can see, I like
This is my wife's testimonial for being the wrong person after her father died
She...
I think living in the old man's shadow
But I like the house, but I can't wait to get rid of all this stuff inside
I didn't tell you, you'll be meeting Stephanie's children
I arrange with the schools for them to come home for the weekend
I hope you don't mind
I thought it might help will convince you that I'm really a family man at heart
You see Tara...
You're the first woman I brought here since Stephanie died it's a bigger payout if...
If I reckon, by lunchtime you'll have them eating out of your hand
- Matey grab the luggage will you?
- Yes sir ...this is our home
Oh oh, we're being watched!
Matey, this is Miss Welles
- My pleasure Miss
- How do you do?
Hello Cuz
- Hello, you're beautiful - he doesn't really like guests
Well I'm glad he like me.
I've always had a way with animals
Out, you get out.
Cuz out
Come on, I'll show you to your room.
Then I'll disappear while I check on lunch
I've had to let all the staff go, well except Matey, of course and... stumbling around the kitchen
So hard to get good help these days
- Eh?
It's got a great view
- Sure has
That's my room, just there.
Don't hesitate if need anything
- See you downstairs
- Ok
Hey...
I'm really glad you're here
I'm too
Come in
Hi
Hi.
You must be Dennis
I know who you are.
I know everything about you.
You're Tara Welles
That's right
My sister used to cut pictures of you out of magazines
Why did she do that?
She thinks you're really beautiful
I don't know if she still does
Would you like me to show you around?
I'd be delighted
Do you mind my being here?
No, I don't mind but Sas, that's Sarah, my sister well half-sister, she doesn't dig it too much
I gather that you and Sas don't like Greg very much
Not very much.
He's another one of mom's mistakes
Mom liked simple things really.
It's just that she let people push her around make them believe she had to do what they wanted instead of just being herself
Sarah is like old Max.
Sort of stubborn
- Tell me about your father
- He was husband number two
He's a research scientist.
He lives in the States
Do you hear from him?
Sure, he sent us a sympathy card after the accident
- Is that your mother's room?
- How did you know that?
Just something about the way you looked when you pass by people
Better not go in there.
Sas is in there, and she's in a kinda stinky mood
She'll come out when she gets hungry
She spend a lot of time in there though
Would you like to see my room?
I thought you'd never ask
When people are giving the tour, they generally give my room the miss
Because it's such a mess
Heavens, did you build all these yourself?
Yeap.
They come in kits, then you put them together
This one was really difficult
Yes, I can see it.
It must have been
I want to be a test pilot when I finish school
Wouldn't that be a bit dangerous?
Nah, it's ok.
I can handle it
Well, there's plenty of time you have to think about your future, isn't it?
That's what my mother always thought but I'm not gonna waste a single second
That's my mother
Do you miss her?
I don't believe my mother is dead
I know what everyone says, but some day she's gonna walk in here
Some people are in for a real shock
- You like your tucker, do you?
- Yeah, he sure does
Ok, so what do we do after lunch?
It's up to you
Well, I'm open to suggestions
Well, there's swimming, sailing, tennis, fishing
- No, not fishing
- Don't you like fishing?
I don't like to kill things
Man kills to survive Dennis.
It's nature's law
He also kills for other reasons Greg
It's a part of human nature.
It's always been that way
It's not going to change.
And look what you're eating
Do you think that steer died of old age?
Hey, come on.
Let's talk about something happy
Told you she'd come out when she got hungry
Hello
Sarah, this is Miss Welles.
She's a famous model
You've seen her on television commercials
I know, who she is
My brother and I have been borrowed for the weekend to be chaperones
Matey, I think Sarah is ready for her lunch
Yes sir
Thank you
You're very pretty
No I'm not.
I look like my mother
Miss Welles is a guest in this house and you know I don't like talking about your mother
Now if you're gonna go on behaving like a spoiled brat
You can cut out of here
Don't you order me about This isn't your house
She pretends to be tough, but she still cries herself to sleep every night.
I've heard her
We'll take the boat out
- Sorry?
- The boat
We'll take the boat out on the harbour
- Sounds like fun
- Yeah, sure
I thought just the two of us
I thought you're a family man
- More coffee?
- Mmm, thanks
What's on your mind Jilly?
Thought it's pretty rare for us to sit down and eat together these days more is the pity
I sense a hidden purpose
I want a divorce
Fine
What took you so long to get around to it?
go on, I did expect it
You won't fight me?
No darling.
I'm a little tired of it all
I've gone along with the situation until now, hoping you'd wake up to Greg to the sort of person he is
Frankly, I find it frankly immoral to continue to support my wife's lover
I'd be meaning to discuss it with you
And hearing you, why didn't you say something?
You got over the others.
I was hoping you'd get over Greg as well
You've been quietly indulging me all this time, have you?
I suppose I have... in a way
How long have you known?
Oh, I can probably pinpoint the day it started
The day we played tennis at Stephanie's, with the Rutherfords
Just before she and Greg left for Eden
Well, you're wrong
It happened long before
Did Stephanie know?
No, of course not
Jilly, I don't know what happened at Eden, but be careful
I think Marsden is capable of almost anything
I intend to marry Mr. Greg Marsden
Can I steer?
Ah yeah, when we clear the traffic
Tara, why do you like Greg?
I like lots of people.
I like you
If you're waiting for me, don't
- Can you swim?
- Sure
My mother was afraid of the water
Come on Dennis
Come on Dennis, I'll race you
Good for you Dennis, I'm a little bit out of condition
You were at my school, outside the gates, the day I twisted my ankle
- When was that?
- Months ago
Must have been someone else.
I don't even know what school you go to
Hey!
Greg!
Dennis
- You think he cares?
- I care
So what happened with you two?
I don't really know
Yeah, they're moody kids.
It's a mistake having them home for the weekend
No it wasn't.
I was really pleased to have met them
Last year or so, must have been terrible
Ah, they're young.
They'll get over it
I hope so
You really like her, don't you Sas?
You pretend you don't, but you do
I don't know what you mean
Just because she's a friend of his, doesn't mean she's the same as he
- She remind you of anyone?
- No
She's no different from any of his other female hangers on
I've seen the look in her eyes when she's with him
She want him to make love to her
I don't believe that.
You've got sex in your brain cause you're going through puberty
I have not.
Anyways, he has no right bringing her into our house
I hate him... and I hate her
You didn't have to turn it off
It's one of my favourites
- What do you want?
- To see how you are
I'm sorry you didn't come out on the harbour with us
No one should have gone
It was my mother's boat.
Our lawyer says he can't touch anything
I think he was only doing it to please me
Impress you, you mean bringing you here, into my mother's house to make love
Sarah!
He is your lover, isn't he?
No, he's not
I'm sorry
Listen to me
Greg is not my lover and nothing will happen in this house that your mother would not approve of
I promise you
How can someone like you be with Greg Marsden?
Things aren't always what they seem
Oh Sassy, I'd like to be your friend if you let me
You're so beautiful
I wish I was
Hey!
When I was your age
I was scared, very self-conscious, had braces on my teeth
I was plump
I didn't think I was a bit beautiful
and I was sure that no one could really like me unless of course he had an alternate motive
So I pretended I didn't care and accepted their attention for whatever reason it was given
It took me a long time to let to of those fears and insecurities
But you know you're beautiful now
I have my moments
My mother was like that because she wasn't beautiful she thought people only like her because she was Stephanie Harper with her money
But you know sometimes, if you're really lucky someone comes along and shows you that real beauty is something that's in here
It's always been there and all you have to do is just trust it
Doesn't mean you can't make the best of what you've got on the outside
For instance, if you pulled your hair back over your pretty face
It'd make a big difference
Anyway,
Friends?
Maybe
- Hi
- Hi
Grab a sit
- Sure I'm not intruding?
- You're not
That's my mother, when she was younger with grandpa Max
Really?
Matey, hi.
Sorry to barge in unannounced
Mrs. Stewart?
Where is he?
Where's the master of the house?
He didn't mention that you were coming
Matey...
just tell him I'm here.
Ok?
Very well, I'll let him know
Go tell him about the news...
the wonderful news
Hi Jilly
Hi there Jilly.
I thought it was you
Ah, ha, Jilly.
What a pleasant surprise!
Should have called and let us know you were coming
Tara Welles, this is Jilly Stewart an old friend of the family's
Hi
You have to excuse us Tara, but me and Jilly have some very important business we have to discuss
Dennis will look after you, won't you mate?
Sure
Excuse us
That was auntie Jilly...
she drinks
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What am I doing?
You bastard, what is she doing here?
- You're drunk
- Well, what if I am?
You're having an affair with her, aren't you?
- I'm warning you Jilly
- I too
No, I never had the lady.
I've taken her out a couple of times, that's all
Oh, baby
Baby, come here
Come here
I'm working it, so I'm staying out with a few other women
I'm just trying to take the suspicion of this
The way you've been behaving, I had to do something, didn't I?
- Is that the truth?
- Yeap
Do you really think I'd be carrying on with some strange woman under my wife's roof?
with my wife's children here?
And aren't you forgetting something?
You still do have a husband
Oh, ha... that's what I came to tell you
Phillip has agreed to a divorce
Now we can get married
Oh, smile baby
- What's all this?
- I think I'd better go, don't you?
Just don't have to!
If I stayed now, it wouldn't be the same
Well, I'll drive you home
No, it's ok.
Dennis has called me a taxi
- Oh, has he?
- I asked him to
Jilly was a close friend of my wife's
She's also Sarah's godmother
I see
Well!
Well, I'll take that...
Thank you
Bye bye Dennis
Say goodbye to Sassy for me, will you?
Are you sure I can't drive you home?
Tara, I'm really sorry
Don't worry about it
She's been drinking
I worked that out
- I'll call you later
- Fine
- Chromone please
- Right
What's the matter?
Ahhh!
Don't you ever turn up here unannounced, and drunk
Not ever again.
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Oh, come on hit me again, why don't you?
God, Greg!
Hello
Dan
Thought you'd already left?
Well, can't a fellow change his mind?
You've been waiting long?
Yeah, most of the day
Still you're here now.
That's what matters
Although, I was beginning to think you'd gone away for the weekend
Well, would you like to come in for a...
No.
There's something I want to ask you first
All it requires is a simple yes or no answer
Will you marry me?
I can't
Why can't you?
- Oh Dan, please
- It's a reasonable enough question
I love you...
I wanna marry you
I warn you, I'm stubborn
Now I won't give in without a fight
I thought on Orpheus that you and I had reached some understanding
Tara, you haven't told me a thing
Now I know something is wrong.
It worries me
You worry me
It's not your concern.
I'm not your concern
Aren't you?
Dan, you don't know the first thing about me
I know I want to spend the rest of my life with you
Is there someone else?
- In a way
- That's a hell of an answer
It's the only answer I can give you
Are you in love with him?
Dan, will you please just leave me alone, and go back to your island and forget I ever existed
Sure... sure... if you can look me in the eyes and tell me you don't love me
I don't love you
You're lying
Good luck Tara
Oh Dan...
I love you...
God I love you
Hello
What took you so long?
I was just thinking about you
That's nice sorry again about tonight Tara
It really was a farce
Don't worry about it
Can I see you?
Greg, I've been thinking
I want to go somewhere where there no people, no interruptions
I wonder how'd you feel about going up to Eden?
I've heard you talk about it it sounds like a perfect place for two people to get back together
Eden?
I'd rather not
I realize that it must have some unhappy memories for you
It does
Look, why don't we drive up to the mountains for a week
It really would be a lot better
But we're both too well known
Greg, I just want to be alone with you at Eden
Really?
Really
Ok ok, I'll call Katy
Fantastic
So, what's you doing?
I'm in bed with my cat
I'll come over?
No you won't
I can be there in five minutes
Oh, I'm sure you could
I'll call you in the morning?
Ok
Sleep tight
Good night
Hello
Hello, Jilly?
It's Tara
I have to tell you the truth
Heh?
I'm flying out to Eden, with Greg
What?
We're at the airport.
We leave in a few minutes
Eden... what?
I thought you ought to know
I thought you said nothing was going on
I'm sorry Jilly.
Goodbye
Hello?
Tutaj mój ojciec by³ królem
W dniu w którym zmar³, 17 lat temu
Mia³am 23 lata, by³am samotna i ba³am siê
Gdybym wiedzia³a wtedy o koszmarze jaki nadchodzi³
Myœlê ¿e wybra³abym œmieræ z nim
Nadje¿dzaj¹!
Greg, jak siê czujesz bêd¹c poœlubionym z najbogatsz¹ kobiet¹ w Australii?
Fantastycznie
Thought you were never gonna make it Greg
Blame the traffic I'm a biss man here
Fajny samochód, prezent œlubny?
Tak, to prawda
Jak odpowiadasz na krytyke, ¿e poœlubi³eœ Stephanie dla pieniêdzy?
Mog¹ mówiæ co chc¹, to jest to co mówiê
- Greg wiêc zatem...
- To jest prawdziwa mi³oœæ?
Absolutnie
Czy to oznacza koniec Twojej kariery tenisowej Greg?
Nie ma mowy
How about your form Greg, gotta admit it hasn't been up to scratch lately?
Too much of the good life maybe, hey?
You don't believe everything you read in the papers?
You should know that Robert
Hah, hah
Czy to Twoje pierwsze ma³¿eñstwo Greg?
Yeap... and I'll miss it if I hang out here too much longer
- Do zobaczenia pó¿niej
- Do zobaczenia
Powodzenia
Do you remember when we were little girls how we used to dream of marrying a handsome prince when we grew up?
Yeah
Well mine finally turned up
Oh Jilly, I want him more than I wanted anything in my life.
You look very nice
- Honestly?
- Honestly
Here I am, about to follow you down the aisle for the third time, Stephanie Harper and I haven't even met the groom, now where is he?
You'll like him, I know you will
Jilly, what do you think of this?
Ou la la!
Here you go, do that
I've never worn anything like this before
I'd watch out if I were you, Stephanie is trying to tell you something
Talk of the devil, it looks like the groom has finally arrived
That's him?
- How are you Matey *
- Oh, Mr. McMaster!
- Big Day
- Oh, yes
Well we followed all your instructions sir
I think you'll find everything is under control
Ah, as always with you Matey
- Stephanie, you do look lovely
- Thank you
- Welcome home Jilly, how was the trip?
- Oh, fine thanks
Bill did you bring the papers for me to sign?
Yes I did, but I have to tell you the board weren't happy about it
I didn't expect them to be
You can run half the money in the other companies single-handed if you wanted to
You don't need my help
Bill, you know I couldn't have managed all these years without you
But, I do think it would have been wiser though if you'd provided for your husband from your personal funds rather than through the company
I don't intend to make the same mistakes again, Bill
I want my husband to be financially independent from the outside and I don't want it to look like a hand-out
No, there's no problem.
From this moment Greg is on the payroll
Thank you
You happiness is my only concern Steph.
Any help you may need, you're only to ask
I know
Well... good luck
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the presence of God and before this gathering, to join Greg and Stephanie, together in matrimony and to seek on their behalf, God's blessing and His grace
What do you think of your mother's new husband?
I hardly know him.
I've only met him twice before
I think that goes for everyone
Hey, did you and Sassy have any trouble getting the day off from boarding school?
*
It really wasn't a problem auntie Jilly, mother has always send Sas for her weddings*
We get time off for good behaviour
That's just the sort of thing your grandfather would have said
Excuse me
Sas!
Poor kids
Hey... cheer up Sas It's not the end of the world*
The main thing is, mom is happy
Yeah
But why does it have to be him?
Bill!
You well?
Very well.
Stephanie tells me you've decided against honeymooning in Europe
You're gonna fly out to Eden instead
Yes... but not for a month or so
Yes, good.
In that case maybe you can drop by the office sometime before you leave
I can come in on Monday
Alright.
Say 11:30 after we can have some lunch
I'll look forward to that, Bill gives us a chance to get better acquainted
I'll see you on Monday
You're very quiet
It's jetlag
Yeah, it all seem to go off quite well
Let's face it.
Stephanie has had plenty of practice.
Oh!
Do I detect a bitchy note?
Oh, I'm sorry...
I'm just tired
We won't stay long
What do you make of Marsden?
I wouldn't trust him with my loose change
Sas, Champagne?
You're so childish I'll have punch, thank you
Hello!
It's alright, forget it
Seems I'm not very popular with my daughter
She'll get over it
How about you?
I'm fine
Phil, how about some footage of me with my big son?
It's a pleasure
Go ahead now.
Smile for the dickie bird
I love you
Well, say something We'll like a pair of shop window dummies
Good year, isn't it?
You're drinking champagne?
What would your head master say if I send you back snotched?
He doesn't care.
All the kids are lushes
Hey, how's it all going?
Wonderful... just if my two other marriages never happened
He knows you didn't mean it
Darling, you haven't officially met Phillip Stewart
- Phillip?
- Congratulations Greg
Thank you
And this is my darling, Jilly
Hi, congratulations
Thanks
Apart from my children, you are the two people I love most
I want you to be friends
Get together you two.
I want a shot of you.
Thanks Phillip
Have you noticed?
Just stepped off a plane
You look beautiful darling
- I don't feel too hot
- Ah, you look great Jilly
Get closer together
Oh, that's lovely.
Mmm, this is gonna be real academy award stuff
Teeth!
Oh...
Out
Hmm, it has its moments...
good and bad
It's certainly never been dull with Jilly and actually I'm worried about her, her moods fluctuate so much lately
Seems alright to me!
I'm glad she and Greg get on so well,
I must admit I was a bit worried she wouldn't like him
It looks like match point
- Jilly, you were fantastic
- Congratulations
Good to have a match with a pro every now and again
I can see I'm going to have to give you lessons Jilly
Fine.
Are you expensive?
Very... but I'm also very good
- Yeah?
- Yeah
- Hello darling
- Phillip
How long you guys are gonna spend in Eden?
A month, alone in the outback
Oh, Katie will be there, but otherwise it will just be us, the dealers and wide-open space
Oh wow, you are gonna adore Eden
I want her to love it the way I do It's the one place I've always been happy
Darling, I have a great idea
Why don't we get Phillip and Jilly to join us at Eden?
Well, for the last couple of weeks, anyway?
Oh, I don't think Phillip will be here.
He's got to go back to New York
Well, how about just Jilly then?
Oh don't be silly, it's your honeymoon, God!
Our lives together are going to be one long honeymoon
Aren't they darling?
I'll hold you to that
Gosh, Jilly and I haven't been to Eden together for...
Donkeys years
You're right
Well, it's up to Jilly
Well, come on Jilly?
Oh, I don't know, we'll see...
maybe
...It'll be dust in the carburator
I'll have the bloody thing there and cleared, hell
It's vapour lock
- What?
- Vapour lock
What's that thing?
Don't worry, it's the carburator
It's vapour lock.
You've been dodling, that's what's caused it
Katie is awfully good with engines darling
Will you leave it to me?
It's all yours my dear
I was right.
Vapour locked
Might as well take it easy, we gotta wait for it to cool
So when did you happen to open a garage?
Don't you worry, I could have if I wanted
- Come on
- Does she really know what she's doing?
You must always trust Katie darling
Oh, I do, I do
Well, I'm afraid it's the lantern tonight darling
Katie is a truffle indisposed at the moment*
She's the only one that ever understood the generator
I'll bet it's vapour locked
If that generator ran on sherry like she does, we wouldn't be in the dark
Katie doesn't drink much
Not much?
Well, not that much
Oh Greg, she's nearly 70
I won't be long
Hey... come here
Will you ever have assets?
*
Hey, it's ok
No it's not
Relax... and I keep telling you it's gonna be alright
You worry too much
I love you
Oh, here she comes
Thanks Kit
Hello darling
Hello
Oh, so glad to see you It's gonna be wonderful
- Hello Chris
- Hi
- How was your trip?
- Internable*
- Hello Jilly
- Hi Greg
Welcome to Eden
Have you eaten?
Hope you haven't cause Katie has prepared a special lunch
No, no just breakfast at Darwin Airport.
It was gaustely
Oh, you'll never guess what we're doing the day after for tomorrow

He makes life fun
Oh, Jilly...
I love him so much
I must be the luckiest woman in the world
I even agreed to go on his awful crocodile hunt
You know how I feel about killing things
Oh well!
A woman in love will do anything for their man.
Isn't it right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Oh, I couldn't have stood being away for another minute
Oh God, I've missed you
I couldn't bear the though I mean touching her

You can see where he tried to get a bite out of the boat last night
They're huge, aren't they?
You think this is big Wait till you meet Gindy Baroo
He's an old soldie, at 70 years old, 20 foot long
I've been trying to catch him for the last couple of years
He always gives me the slip
Life's put a price on his head Reckon he's killed 4 people already
Joe you're giving me goosebumps
You'll be alright Mrs. Marsden We'll look after you.

You wanna fight me, go ahead

Wasn't it?
Yes
Good girl
It's just you and me

Let's get out of here
I don't have too many visitors here except for native mate who brings me stuff every now and then tea you know *
Pay him gold
He gave me this concoction the aborals make out of flowers and clay
pongs a bit, but it'll stop you from getting infected
I pulled you out of the river *
Bloody miracle
Looks like a smaller croc got a hold of you
If it'd been one of the big buggers, if you can pardon the language, you wouldn't be here to tell the tale
I know it hurts bad, girl
but this is a special brew it'll help the pain don't you worry, old Dave Welles will see you right
Still up girlie?
Take it easy
I don't want to stay in bed all the time
Well, last time I was in town, was 10 years ago and that was to get the teeth fixed got a wife somewhere, I owe 20 years alimony to so I gotta be careful in case they nab me
get you some clothes, help yourself course I'm not gonna kick you out, but well, the sooner you're on your way, the sooner you can contact your friends, your family let them know you're alive
they've been searching for you for over three weeks the town is full of coppers
but no one can ever find this place
It's secret
No one ever comes here, unless I bring them
Oh Dave..
I'm so frightened to leave here
I still can't remember anything
I don't even know my name all I know is... maybe I'm married
Give it time girlie
Give it time
Long time back
I lost my mind, and I got married
I fell in love with a little girl form Mount Aisa
She was a publican's daughter and her name was Tara
You see her mother only saw one movie picture show in her whole life and that was Gone With The Wind
Well, I didn't mind, and it had a ring to it *
Well, we were sweethearts
Till one terrible day, she... she shot through the town and married a butcher
So, if it's alright with you, I'll call you Tara
Going away present
It's a tin of all dreams, I've got no use for anymore opals like that will give you stuff
Look at the colour
Like fire at night
You'll get a good price for these when you take them into town but don't you let them rob you
Well...
I'll see you
If you have a run into my Mrs. don't you let on you know where I am
Thank you
Good bye...
Tara

Yes
It's nice to have a bit of company
Are you ok?
Just feeling a little quiet, eh?
Hey lady, you can't forget your money they're very good stuff you gave me *
There's over three thousand dollars hey, don't lose it, will you?
Are you alright?

Tara Welles
Welles?
Welcome to the Marshall Clinic
Oh, isn't it a great day?

I am Elizabeth Mason, but everybody calls me Lizzie
It's Tara, isn't it?
Yes
Is that all your luggage?
Give it there Lucky
Now, this what I call traveling light
Let's get you out of this sun before you melt.
And you behave yourself.
Go catch some fish or something.
- Good bye
- Ha, ha!
Doc Marshall is in surgery, otherwise he would have met you himself but I'm part of the staff, sort of general dog's body
How did you hear about the clinic?
Magazine article... it said that you specialize in reconstructive surgery
Doc Marshall is one of the best plastic surgeons in the whole country
This one's yours
They're really comfy
Don't you worry love They will leave you smiling *
Well, I'll see you later.
I'll tell Doc Marshall you've arrived
What kind of an accident was it, that caused injuries like these?
I know it hurts to talk Mrs. Welles, but...
I do have to ask some questions
Car collision
How long ago?
Six weeks
Only six weeks?
An old man... a friend, who knew something about aboriginal herbal remedies a paste made from flowers and clay
Yes, we use some of those here
Your jaw has been badly broken, but it seems to have mended again properly
Your friend certainly knew what he was doing
I owe him my life
But your injuries are extensive and severe Mrs. Welles
They require more than just the one operation
They'll be several.
Reconstructive, cosmetic.
There will be pain.
A great deal afterwards, extreme discomfort
I'm not afraid of pain
We couldn't begin to operate until the scar tissue softens, and that could be several weeks
That's alright
Do you have a recent photograph of yourself?
One taken, before the accident?
No I don't.
I'm sorry
Doctor Marshall, I want more than just having these scars covered up
I want to look different
When I leave here, I want to be a completely different person
Hey, can you grab the rope?
Mind tying it around the log for me?
Thanks, that's great
Hey there girl, come here
Well, what do you reckon?
Not bad for a couple of hours of work, eh?
You fish?
No
Here it has its practical purposes, it helps with the food bits
Ah, what do you think of it?
It's nice
It has a... natural healing power Perfect place to practice medicine
Unfortunately it took quite a few years and a lot of headaches to convince the bureaucracy of it
Where were you born?
In the country
Ah, I envy you that!
What about family?
No one
You don't like talking about yourself to much, do you?
Dr. Marshall...
I understood that you guaranty your patients' privacy
Ok, I promise not to ask anymore leading questions, and you're gonna have to stop calling me Dr. Marshall
My name is Dan
Alright
Come on
Ben, you take it slow this time, you little... ha, ha...
That was terrific
Tara, your magazines are here
They came on the morning launch
This dress look at you.
Every time I see you, you're thinner... ha,
We'll knock a few more kilos of you yet, before it's all over
I should talk!
Different for me, I work here
Hm, ha!
Here you go
You sure get through some magazines
It keeps me occupied
Good morning Lizzie
Good day Dan
Hi, good morning, how are you feeling?
Fine
Hello Ben
Hi Dan.
Swam three lengths yesterday
Well, that's great
Like you.
It was a car accident
He was a passenger.
The others were all killed.
They were burned to death.
One of them was his father
Are you alright?
Tara?
Is anything wrong?
The water makes me nervous.
I can't swim
Swimming is gonna be an important part of your rehabilitation
We'll have to do something about that
All the hidden booze when I met him Busted marriage!
In and out of institutions...
he offered me a job
Your Dan Marshall's a good blog
I asked him once why he never go married
He said there's been a couple of special ladies, but he couldn't cut the life he leads
This place looks a bit like a posh resort, but it takes all your time then, the dedicated type
whoever married him would have to be willing to adjust their lives to his
Are you sure I'm not hurting?
No, no it's fine
Hi.
Lizzie said this is where I'd find you
I often come here myself... to sit
A lot of contrast to our side of the island
Tomorrow is the big day
I just wanted to say it one last time
Once we start, there's no turning back
I know
There're no guarantees
It's alright...
I understand
Again
Again
Townsil Police *
Hello.
This is Dr. Marshall here, from the clinic on Ofclear Sound *
Can I speak to sergeant Johnson please?
- Just a moment please
- Thank you
Sergeant Johnson here, how are you?
Yeah, hello Sam...
Dan Marshall
Hey, how are you?
I'm fine, thanks
I was wondering if you could... track down a missing person for me
A friend is it?
Yeah, she's a patient of mine
Suffering a temporary memory loss
Take it easy... it'll be alright everything went very well rest easy
Hey mate?
Tara, came to say good bye
When do you leave?
In a few minutes.
I'd kiss you, but I can't find the space
Anyway, take care of yourself
Good luck Ben
Yeah, you too
- Pier right?
*
- Thank you
Scalpel, frontel *
And again and the scissors
Thank you
So far, so good
How's the pain?
I know, it hurts like hell
I'm ok
We're taking the bandages off tomorrow, Tara
I want you to be prepared for shock
A mean hell of a shock
When you look in the mirror for the first time
They'll be your eyes looking back at you, but from the face of a stranger
Good morning, how did you sleep?
Not very well
Neither did I. Let's not prolong the suspense
You realize there'll be bruising, some puffiness and the stitches will have to remain in for a while
You ready?
Remember, I don't know how you looked before the accident or even how you sounded
How about if you like what you see, you just nod?
Sister Wisner, you're wanted in recovery...
Sister Wisner...
You're doing it!
You're doing it!
So says top... fashion consultant and agency head, Joanna Randall
with a good collection of adaptable accessories you can dress up or down, with little fuss so says top fashion consultant and agency head, Joanna Randall
I can't tell you what a relief that is
Have dinner with me tonight?
I wouldn't miss it for queen *
I really must learn to cook
If you ever need a guinea pig, give me a call
I fancy being around when you serve up your first bacon and eggs
I didn't know 40 year old ladies blushed!
Or is it just the glow from the fire?
Going away present
My seashells will always remind me of Orpheus
You are so beautiful
Well, you should be very proud, you did it
Hey, you're still the same lady I met six months ago.
Don't you ever forget it
I just wish you'd trust me enough, to tell me what it is you're running away from
Dan
At least tell me you have somewhere to stay when you get to the city and enough money
I'll be fine
I'm gonna miss you
You must know by now, I think of you as special
Dan, there's some things I have to do, alone.
I'm sorry but I just can't talk about it.
Now please, please no more questions
Ok... ok
Come on.
Let's eat it before it burns
- Ready to push off Dan
- Thanks Lucky
Scared?
A little
If you ever need anything, just call
I'll be alright
Good luck Tara
Good bye
Yes?
Bill, Greg Marsden is still here.
It's been over half an hour
Alright Margaret, show him in
This is a surprise visit Greg, what can we do for you?
I've tried to get you on the phone all week
Yes I know.
I've been out of the office quite a bit
It's a busy time of the year.
Why don't you sit down?
It's been eight months since Stephanie died, Bill
Press had a field day there for a while.
Would have thought the world was coming to an end
Now it's as if she never even existed
Stephanie Harper hasn't been forgotten
Certainly not by me
I find it hard to believe, that after three separate searches two organized by this company that still a body has not been found
Something, a skeleton
Everything that could be done, has been done
Well, I'm not satisfied
Really?
Do you honestly mean to tell me that this huge organization with all its resources that can manage to find uranium, iron ore, gold, oil can't even find a handful of bloody bones?
You hypocrite your only reason for wanting Stephanie's death legally established is money
Well, I loved Stephanie Harper, she was like a daughter to me and it's a pity you never took the trouble to get to know her before she died
She wasn't perfect, but she was warm and cared about people
Every begging letter that arrived, she'd read, and some she'd cry over and she'd give and give and give and all she ever asked for herself was to be accepted for what she was, rather than who she was
She tried damn hard, and that's ever tough for everyone
Yes, I'd love the chance to give Stephanie a proper funeral but I'm glad they didn't find the body because I want you to sweat out every moment of the next seven years after that time, you're legally entitled to a slice
of one of the biggest fortunes in Australia
But I should point out, that before Stephanie married you
I persuaded her to add a clause to her will
In the event of her pre-deceasing you, and you re-married, you forfeit the lot
Meantime, you can try getting a job
Working for a living might prove a pleasant change
Yes!
- Mr. Dell?
- That's right
I'm the lady who rang about the room
Oh, good
The ad said $50 a week
That's right.
It's payable a month in advance, and there's $100 bond
Oh, you didn't mention anything about a bond, or paying in advance
Well, landlords have to protect themselves you know
I've fasted people in the past and they've done a midnight flee on me
I've arrived in Sydney with $400, and I still got things to buy
I haven't even got a job yet
I'm sorry, I'm wasting your time
No, hold on, alright we'll forget about the bond
Could we make it two weeks in advance?
I don't know what it is about you, but well, somehow I feel safe with you
Alright, two weeks in advance
Thank you
- Could I see the room?
- Oh yes, come in, come in
It's a nice old pub...
quite bit of Aussie history
When would you want to move in?
Right away, if I could
It's ok with me
How old is the hotel?
It was served pub in 1915, there's a lot of photos down in... *
It's got a harbour view...
I'll take it
Fine.
What's your name?
Tara Welles
My god, it's Gone With The Wind, isn't it?
I'm Sandy.
Well anything you need, just give us a yell.
Ok?
Thanks...
Sandy
It's ok
You hungry darling?
You don't say who you belong to either, do you?
Want some dinner?
Come on then...
Maxie.
How do you like that eh?
Maxie.
Good boy Maxie
You're impatient, aren't you?
Here you go.
It wasn't your turn
Ayo?
...
Hello?
Hello
Tara, feel like a night cap?
Hey Dennis, get him
Maxie
They've grown so much
You should've seen my little princess She was so beautiful
She only missed three notes
Oh, excuse me
I'm expecting a taxi.
It hasn't been and gone, has it?
No, I don't think so
Oh.. they did say 20 minutes and, of course I usually get the bus but, I haven't been at all well lately
Ah... here he is
I couldn't give you a lift, could I?
No, thank you
Oh, well, good afternoon
No baby
Thanks, bye bye
I'd like to see Joanna Randall, please
I'm sorry, she's busy at the moment
I think Joanna would like to see you
Thank you
Won't be a tick *
I need an agent
Someone who can get me on the cover of Vogue in six months
He has brought us the most incredible today's special.
A multi-function conduction hoven that will really take care of all...
Just give me the damn phone number.
I'm so excited because we have all these ustensils and appliances.
Will they work together ?
Look at that.
I made a pizza dough in the food process.
Look at the....
I put even strench a bigger paddle.
My furnace not big enough.
Great.
It must be the fire department.
Sarah Banerman ?
Hey.
I was in the area.
What's that smell ?
Ho nothing.
I was just burning lunch.
Oh...
What was it supposed to be?
Grilled cheese.
Well, you got the "griled" part down.
Ever think about getting a housekeeper?
Just every time I get hungry.
Yeah.
So, what's up?
Oh, uh...
JJ mentioned something about you having an old baseball glove that he could use.
You're not have to come over here for that.
I could have dropped it by your house.
Unless, there's something else on your mind?
Tough to fool a psychic.
Yeah...
Yeah, ok, uh...
I've been doing some volunteer counseling down at the woman's outreach center.
They have a program for homeless women.
Sounds great.
It is.
Truth is, I think I probably get more out of it than the women in the program do.
What do you mean?
Well, with Walt working on these late hours and JJ becoming more and more independent...
Just have a lot of free time.
It feels good to give back, you know.
Sounds good.
But there is more, right?
There's this girl, her name is Erica.
I've been helping her through the job training program.
A few days ago she just stopped showing up.
I don't know, I just...
I have this feeling.
Feeling ?
What kind of feeling ?
That she's out there somewhere...
in trouble.
The center operates almost exclusively on private funding.
This is where Erica's work station was.
I don't wanna die.
Please!
Let me out of here!
Don't...
Did you see something?
Yeah.
We've got to talk to Walt.
This picture was taken a few weeks ago at the community center.
That's the girl I saw in my vision.
Do you have any idea where she was being held?
It looked like a little girl's bedroom.
Could be anywhere.
I checked all the emergency call center.
Nobody named Erica Carlson showed up missing.
If that's even her real name.
Why would she lie?
Women who come from abusive relationships.
Sometimes them don't want to be found.
Sarah, do you remember anything that she might have said?
Somebody bothering her.
An ex-boyfriend, something like that.
She didn't really talk about her personal life.
I should have tried to get closer.
I'll take the picture out on the streets, see if we can find anyone recognizes her.
I'll go with you.
We'll do our best to find her okay ?
Don't look at me.
Please I just want to go home.
I won't tell anybody, I promise.
Please, don't.
Please, I just want to go home.
I'll do anything you asked me to.
Just please don't...
Get dressed and fix your face.
Sorry,
Com'on.
Hold on a second!
I want to talk to you.
Sorry, officer, I was just waiting for my mother to pick me up.
Your mother?
For cheerleading practice.
Hey,
I know you!
No, I don't think so.
I never forget a face.
You're that mind-reading guy.
I've seen a picture in the newspaper.
You're way hotter in person.
Thank you.
Hey, y'wanna touch me and guess your future?
Sheriff, you wanna...
Do you recognize this girl?
My God
Do you know her?
I can't remember.
You can't remember.
Normally, it's too cold out here to give you girls a hard time.
But you stand in the way of a criminal investigation, I'll make it my top priority.
Her name is Erica...
Last name?
I don't know.
I swear!
She used to crash at my place when the weather got bad.
She's a colleague of yours?
She's a sweet kid.
End of story.
When was the last time you saw her?
I dunno, maybe a week ago.
She stashed some stuff at my place.
Do you mind if I take a look?
I normally do appointments.
Let me get this straight.
You can predict the winning Lotto numbers, but you don't?
It's kinda complicated.
It's crazy.
What's the point of having super-powers unless there's some cash in it?
Hey, why won't you just let the man do his job.
How long have you lived here Tamie?
Six months.
This place has been a transient motel for the last ten years.
Can you at least tell me if I have a shot at The Sweet Six?
You know what, I'll tell you what.
You ask one more question and I'll predict the next thirty days of your life.
And trust me, it ain't gonna include Ed McMahon walking through that door.
You keep money in this drawer.
I used to leave Erica a few dollars for pizza.
Walt I think we need to get going.
Tamie, thank you for your time.
Tell me one thing, will ya?
Yeah, if I can.
Is Erica ever coming back?
We're working on it.
So we just follow this bus until you see the house from your vision?
Yes, assuming it has any connection to Erica's disappearance.
Listen I just want to say thanks getting involved with this, John.
It means a lot to Sarah.
Cool.
So, how are things at home these days?
Good.
Why?
No, no reason.
Sarah did mention that JJ is growing up.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Nothing.
Just making conversation, that's all.
Well that's weird she would bring up something like that and then just drop it.
It's not like her.
Well, she did say...
Forget it.
It's just...
No, what?
I...
I think she feels neglecte, that's all.
Neglected?
She actually used the word negleted ?
It's only natural at this point in her life.
'Neglected'?
That's a little harsh, don't you John?
Walt, stop.
I know, I've been preoccupied with work.
But it's not like I work in a freakin' car wash.
Walt, stop.
You try listening to everybody's problems all day long.
Sometimes you just want to get on a plane and want go to freakin' Las Vegas, you know ?
- Walt!
Stop the car!
- What ?
What ?
Ho, this is the house from your vision?
That's it.
I'll call it in.
Get an ID on the owner.
Lokk, all that stuff about flyin' to Vegas...
I don't mean nothing by else.
It's alright, I get it.
The owner of the house is a self employed C.P.A. named Richard Finney.
Thirty-three, Caucasian, he's got no priors.
There's something wrong.
I just feel it.
Nobody's comin' and you know it.
You wanna get outta here?
You're gonna have to do it yourself.
Listen, cover the back, right ?
Keep the head up.
I don't know what we're dealing with here.
Yeah I'm on it.
Lookin' for somebody?
#######
Did you hear something?
I'm not sure.
Double pepperoni with extra mushrooms?
Can I help you, officer?
Checked the house top to bottom.
There's nobody here.
Alright, we've got to get out here.
Roscoe get everybody out okay ?
Thank you.
Walt.
You can't just walk away.
There's nobody here, John.
What do you want me to say ?
We're missing something.
Is there anything else we can do?
No.
You've been very cooperative.
Thank you for your help.
We appreciated.
Mr. Smith?
He took you, too.
I beg your pardon?
You were abducted, weren't you?
What are you talking about?
We're looking for a missing girl, possible kidnapping.
I f you have any information...
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not true.
I'm going to ask you to leave now.
Both of you.
Alright.
We're going.
Sorry sir.
I saw her.
I was there, I was in the room and I saw her.
That was strange.
Very.
What do you think it was all about?
I'm not sure.
Case of mistaken identity, I'd imagine.
Right.
That's probably what it was.
You okay?
Don't beat yourself up.
Nobody's right a 100% all the time.
I'm not wrong.
She's lying.
What do you want me to do?
Arrest her for denying a vision.
Roscoe.
I need you to hell over to Harrison Street.
- The Raintree motel?
- Room 16.
Bring the print guys with you.
And listen... anything that room knows, I want on my desk in two hours.
I'm on it.
Don't worry something will turn up right ?
And what if it doesn't Walt?
Walt!
I can help you find her.
He doesn't know what happened, does he?
He's a good man.
Decent.
He won't understand this.
What's this?
Have you been to the Raintree Motel?
I have.
Room 16.
I want you tell us about your abduction.
It was three years ago, December.
It was a cold night.
The kind of cold you feel deep down in your bones.
It was late.
I had worked all night long
I was tired.
I crossed between two buildings when he
when he grabbed me.
Listen Lindsa, it's okay.
You're safe here.
Alright?
He put his hand across my mouth.
I smelled chemicals, then I blacked out.
When I woke up, I was in a strange place...
Did he hurt you?
Not at first.
I was so frightened.
You're doing great.
Just try to relax.
He brought me pretty dresses and expensive make-up.
He had this way about him, gentle, but dangerous.
There were times I felt like I was the only woman left in the world.
He punished me when I made mistakes.
Mistakes?
What kind of mistakes Linda?
"The dress must never be wrinkled.
A neatly pressed dress makes for a clean and presentable woman."
"The makeup should be subtle.
Too much makes a woman look cheap.
Hair should be neatly combed and above the shoulders..."
Please?
!
Give me another chance.
I can be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need.
There was a train whistle.
Right?
In the distance.
I'd nearly forgotten.
There's still run freight trains out of Bangor.
Linda, why hasn't you come to the police?
I was faceless.
Nameless.
Living on the streets.
Who was gonna believe me?
We will appreciate your help.
I just ask something in return.
What's that?
I want to come with you.
I want to be there when you find him.
We just got a hit off the photograph.
A positive ID on the missing girl.
I have to call Sarah, tell her I'll be late for dinner... again.
Excuse me Linda, I'll be right back.
You're okay?
I'm fine.
Hello.
How's my beautiful wife?
Any news about Erica?
Well actually that's why I'm calling.
Bangor P.D. got a positive ID off the photo.
Her real name is Erica Carter.
There's a mother up on Glacier Lake.
But we haven't made contact yet.
Glacier Lake?
That's less than an hour from here.
I should have paid more attention.
Sarah, come on, it's not your fault.
We're so understaffed down at the community center,
I mean the phones don't even work half the time...
It's amazing anyone gets any helped.
Listen, as soon as this is over, you and me are gonna take a little bit of time.
Two summers special.
- I gotta go, alright?
- Ok, I love you.
Yeah, me too.
I'll talk to you on bed.
Bye.
Let's go find this girl, come on.
Was this stuff in the Raintree?
Dusted the room for prints.
Did you get anything interesting?
Not unless you count two members of the Cleaves Mills city council, the Mayor's brother and the town librarian.
Beautiful.
Napkin.
Eat.
What is that?
It's my lipstick.
Why is it so hard for you to understand?
Why can't you see what I'm trying to do?
What is it?
I'll fix it.
Why does it have to be fixed?
!
Why can't you just do it right the first time?
No !
Look at yourself!
Do you think that's pretty?
Do you think that's what I want?
Do you?
!
You're just like the others.
Imperfect.
Flawed.
Disgusting.
Stop your blubbering.
I'm sorry.
I didn't
I show you kindness and this is how you repay me.
I didn't see anything...
I...
I won't say anything to anybody.
I promise..
I believe you.
We can try again.
I'll do better this time.
I promise.
I'm afraid our lessons are over.
What did you got ?
Erica, she tries to escape.
She sees his face and he kills her.
And you have no idea if what you saw is Erica's future or her past?
No, but either way we gotta keep looking right ?
There's nothing about this guy that feels remotely familiar too me.
He takes his victims and then lets them go.
He dresses them up and tears them down.
It's crazy.
Psychotic actually.
And now you tell me he's crossed the line.
He's gonna killed this girl, or did kill this girl, if we don't stop him.
John, I'm even don't know where to begin.
Maybe just begin at the end.
I flagged down a passing truck.
This road continues for another thirty miles along the river.
Linda, listen, we won't get in...
Here!
It was right here!
This is where he let me go.
It was dark and I was just standing there in the days... until the morning.
in a pouring rain.
There were other victims...
Six or seven maybe.
This guy, doesn't just abduct women he collects them.
That was Roscoe.
Two-lane service road intersects a freight line about 80 miles north of here.
Let's go find him.
Come on.
I don't need whatever it is your sellin'.
Mrs. Carter?
That's right.
Who are you?
My name is Sarah Bannerman.
I got your address from the Sheriff's department.
Sheriff?
You haven't been contacted yet?
I've been gone since morning'.
I know what this is.
I...
I told the man my car's been in the shop.
Your car?
No...
It's hard to hunt for a job without one.
I only need another few days to make things right.
I'm sorry, I don't think we are talking about the same thing?
You're here to collect the rent money.
No...
I'm here about Erica.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your daughter is missing.
Mrs Carter, did you hear me ?
I said that your daughter is in trouble.
I got no daughter.
Not for nearly three years.
What's that smell?
Not the blue plate special, I hope.
I'm gonna show the picture around... see if anybody recognizes her.
You're not eating.
I'm not hungry.
Mind if I ask you a personal question?
More personal than you wandering through my memories?
Why did you change your mind and decide to help us?
Do you have any idea what it's like to have your life torn in half?
To measure every second of your existence through the center line of one unimaginable event?
Surprisingly, I do.
Why take yourself back there ?
I want to see the look in his eyes.
The expression on his face when he sees me.
Redemption.
That's just a word.
You go through something and it changes you.
It holds a mirror up against everything that's ever, or ever will happen to you from that point forward.
In some ways you could say that my life began and ended while I was with him.
But you survived.
It's gotta count for someone ?
Life should be about more than survival, shouldn't it?
How 'bout some dessert?
No, thank you.
Just the check.
That smell outside?
- The lye.
- Excuse me?
Lye.
To make the soap.
The factory is 'bout 10 miles up the mountain
It's been closed for nearly three years, but you can still smell the lye when the wind kicks up.
I'm such a klutz.
Do you have a bathroom?
Underneath the big salmon, back in the corner.
I'm very... very sorry.
Don't worry about it, just an accident.
Two steak dinners, rare, with all the trimmings.
Looks like you got company?
Just a friend.
It's tonight.
There won't be lessons anymore.
Linda!
Linda, we gotta go.
Walt!
Did you see her?
Do see who?
Linda.
Did she come by here?
Not that I have known.
Why?
Oh, she took my car!
How the hell did she got my keys?
I'm such a klutz.
I'm very sorry.
Don't worry about it, just an accident.
She must have realized we were close to him.
She remembered something, a touch, a taste, a... smell.
You mentioned a soap factory?
Production plant's there.
But nobody goes up there anymore... except Mister Sudz.
Mister Sudz?
That's what everybody calls him.
I don't even know what his real name is.
He's the caretaker.
Personally, I don't know why anybody would want to live up there cut off from civilization.
was he in here earlier tonight?
Come to remember he was...
He ordered...
Two steak dinners to go.
That's right.
I saw Mister Sudz, Walt.
He was picking up food.
Same food that was on the table when Erica was killed.
We've got to go to that factory, hu ?
It's tough without a car.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
County Sheriff!
Stop your vehicle!
You comin' or what?
!
It seems somebody forgot to leave the lights on.
Not a bad place if your hobby is kidnapping.
Or murder.
At least we know she's here.
And why she took off.
What do you mean?
Shotgun's missing.
Probably came here to kill him.
This is Unit 1, requesting back-up on Rural Route 6, ten miles north of the Linwood Inn.
Over.
Roger, Unit 1.
Back-up units are 10:13 to your location.
Over.
Roger that.
Unit 1 out.
Hey, we can't wait for back-up.
They gonna be here in twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes?
This place is huge.
He could be anywhere.
He's going to kill her,
If Linda doesn't get to him first.
You ever see what a 12-gauge shotgun can do to a human body?
Put this on.
Let's go.
You stay here.
I'm gonna check the other side.
No way.
This girl is here because of me.
I'm not going to stand here
Fine, take this.
I don't do guns.
Besides, I might shoot you by mistake.
How would I explain that to Sarah and JJ?
I don't like the idea of leaving you unarmed.
Walt...
I'm a psychic, remember?
Alright.
I go on right.
I'm a psychic
You're gonna be a dead psychic.
Please!
Give me another chance.
I can be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need...
You showed me exactly where I needed to be.
Help me!
Anybody there?
Linda?
I don't expect you to understand this.
I don't completely understand it myself.
When this is over, I want you to tell them it was you that came after me.
Killing this guy is not going to fill up whatever is missing in your life.
You really can't see it, can you?
I have no intention of killing him.
I never did.
You've come back to be with him.
You opened up the door to feelings I'd forgotten.
Emotions I'd pushed out of my memory.
Linda, listen to me.
What you're going through, right know it's not your fault.
Ok?
It's called Stockholm Syndrome.
You don't understand...
It happens to people who've been kidnapped.
They begin to sympathize with their abductor.
Do you understand ?
That's not how this is...
It happened to Patty Hearst.
It happens to prisoners of war.
I don't want to hear anymore!
He's going to hurt you.
Not if she can be everything.
Not if she can be -- perfect.
Hello!
Is somebody there?
Yes, can you hear me ?
Help me!
Erica, you need to listen to me!
You know my name?
I'm locked down.
I'm in a room!
My name is Walt!
I'm the County Sheriff!
You have to come and get me!
He's gonna be back any second!
Listen, I can't get in this way!
I've got to find another way down!
No!
Don't leave me!
I'll be back!
I promise!
Allright ?
Hello!
Hello!
Don't panic.
Walt's coming.
Don't panic, Walt's coming.
Why did you come here?
For you.
I came for you.
Please.
Just give me another chance.
I'll be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need.
You're full of surprises, aren't you.
This can't be what you want.
You have no idea what she wants.
Is this what Erica wants?
To be killed by some lunatic so afraid that he lives his life hiding behind a plastic mask.
You know nothing.
I know you.
I know your mother was never good enough.
and your father demanded perfection.
That she could never give him.
Neither could his little boy.
How could you know that...
So you just keep searching for perfection, don't you ?
Perfection in faces of these women that you take.
Then you throw them away like garbage.
Get down on your knees.
I'm not going to tell you again!
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
We can just go.
Together.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We've got a Shalf dozen cruisers on the way to the hill right now.
You choose, Sheriff.
You can arrest me, and watch your friend die.
Or you can step aside.
It's your choice.
The tank!
NO!
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
We can just go.
Together.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Walt.
Put the gun !
We've got a Shalf dozen cruisers on the way to the hill right now.
You choose, Sheriff.
You can arrest me and you can watch your friend die.
You can step aside.
It's your choice.
Walt, listen to me.
You need to let this one go.
I've seen it before...
Alright,
Fine.
everybody just relax.
Take it easy.
Is it worth it, Linda?
You don't understand.
The factory is full of chemicals.
We have to find Erica
I spoke to her.
I know where she is, she's underneath this building.
Follow me.
Walt!
Put this on...
- Ok.
- Go, go, go!
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be okay.
I'll be right back, okay?
Is she gonna ok ?
She doesn't want to go to the hospital and she can't go home.
Now, you know what...
We could put that matelass out of the garage.
and put it the spare room.
Ya, We could do that.
I mean, she's gonna need someone to take care of her for awhile.
A little while, yeah?
A week... ten days tops.
I really think she can turn her life around, I do.
How could she miss with someone like you?
Ok...
What about Linda?
And what the hell is this that somebody go back to something like that?
Maybe for her the alternative was worse.
Yeah, maybe.
We all need to feel like we matter.
Even if it's just the pain.
Yeah.
My guys are sifting through the roughs trying to find her
Any chance that somebody survive a blow like that ?
It's very doubtfull.
I had the perfect life, until i was in a coma for six years.
Then I woke up and found my fiancée merried to an other man.
They're raising my son.
Everything has changed including me.
One touch and I can see things...
Things that happened, things that will happen.
You should see what I see...
He has brought us the most incredible today's special.
A multi-function conduction hoven that will really take care of all...
Just give me the damn phone number.
I'm so excited because we have all these ustensils and appliances.
Will they work together ?
Look at that.
I made a pizza dough in the food process.
Look at the....
I put even strench a bigger paddle.
My furnace not big enough.
Great.
It must be the fire department.
Sarah Banerman ?
Hey.
I was in the area.
What's that smell ?
Ho nothing.
I was just burning lunch.
Oh...
What was it supposed to be?
Grilled cheese.
Well, you got the "griled" part down.
Ever think about getting a housekeeper?
Just every time I get hungry.
Yeah.
So, what's up?
Oh, uh...
JJ mentioned something about you having an old baseball glove that he could use.
You're not have to come over here for that.
I could have dropped it by your house.
Unless, there's something else on your mind?
Tough to fool a psychic.
Yeah...
Yeah, ok, uh...
I've been doing some volunteer counseling down at the woman's outreach center.
They have a program for homeless women.
Sounds great.
It is.
Truth is, I think I probably get more out of it than the women in the program do.
What do you mean?
Well, with Walt working on these late hours and JJ becoming more and more independent...
Just have a lot of free time.
It feels good to give back, you know.
Sounds good.
But there is more, right?
There's this girl, her name is Erica.
I've been helping her through the job training program.
A few days ago she just stopped showing up.
I don't know, I just...
I have this feeling.
Feeling ?
What kind of feeling ?
That she's out there somewhere...
in trouble.
The center operates almost exclusively on private funding.
This is where Erica's work station was.
I don't wanna die.
Please!
Let me out of here!
Don't...
Did you see something?
Yeah.
We've got to talk to Walt.
This picture was taken a few weeks ago at the community center.
That's the girl I saw in my vision.
Do you have any idea where she was being held?
It looked like a little girl's bedroom.
Could be anywhere.
I checked all the emergency call center.
Nobody named Erica Carlson showed up missing.
If that's even her real name.
Why would she lie?
Women who come from abusive relationships.
Sometimes them don't want to be found.
Sarah, do you remember anything that she might have said?
Somebody bothering her.
An ex-boyfriend, something like that.
She didn't really talk about her personal life.
I should have tried to get closer.
I'll take the picture out on the streets, see if we can find anyone recognizes her.
I'll go with you.
We'll do our best to find her okay ?
Don't look at me.
Please I just want to go home.
I won't tell anybody, I promise.
Please, don't.
Please, I just want to go home.
I'll do anything you asked me to.
Just please don't...
Get dressed and fix your face.
Sorry,
Com'on.
Hold on a second!
I want to talk to you.
Sorry, officer, I was just waiting for my mother to pick me up.
Your mother?
For cheerleading practice.
Hey,
I know you!
No, I don't think so.
I never forget a face.
You're that mind-reading guy.
I've seen a picture in the newspaper.
You're way hotter in person.
Thank you.
Hey, y'wanna touch me and guess your future?
Sheriff, you wanna...
Do you recognize this girl?
My God
Do you know her?
I can't remember.
You can't remember.
Normally, it's too cold out here to give you girls a hard time.
But you stand in the way of a criminal investigation, I'll make it my top priority.
Her name is Erica...
Last name?
I don't know.
I swear!
She used to crash at my place when the weather got bad.
She's a colleague of yours?
She's a sweet kid.
End of story.
When was the last time you saw her?
I dunno, maybe a week ago.
She stashed some stuff at my place.
Do you mind if I take a look?
I normally do appointments.
Let me get this straight.
You can predict the winning Lotto numbers, but you don't?
It's kinda complicated.
It's crazy.
What's the point of having super-powers unless there's some cash in it?
Hey, why won't you just let the man do his job.
How long have you lived here Tamie?
Six months.
This place has been a transient motel for the last ten years.
Can you at least tell me if I have a shot at The Sweet Six?
You know what, I'll tell you what.
You ask one more question and I'll predict the next thirty days of your life.
And trust me, it ain't gonna include Ed McMahon walking through that door.
You keep money in this drawer.
I used to leave Erica a few dollars for pizza.
Walt I think we need to get going.
Tamie, thank you for your time.
Tell me one thing, will ya?
Yeah, if I can.
Is Erica ever coming back?
We're working on it.
So we just follow this bus until you see the house from your vision?
Yes, assuming it has any connection to Erica's disappearance.
Listen I just want to say thanks getting involved with this, John.
It means a lot to Sarah.
Cool.
So, how are things at home these days?
Good.
Why?
No, no reason.
Sarah did mention that JJ is growing up.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Nothing.
Just making conversation, that's all.
Well that's weird she would bring up something like that and then just drop it.
It's not like her.
Well, she did say...
Forget it.
It's just...
No, what?
I...
I think she feels neglecte, that's all.
Neglected?
She actually used the word negleted ?
It's only natural at this point in her life.
'Neglected'?
That's a little harsh, don't you John?
Walt, stop.
I know, I've been preoccupied with work.
But it's not like I work in a freakin' car wash.
Walt, stop.
You try listening to everybody's problems all day long.
Sometimes you just want to get on a plane and want go to freakin' Las Vegas, you know ?
- Walt!
Stop the car!
- What ?
What ?
Ho, this is the house from your vision?
That's it.
I'll call it in.
Get an ID on the owner.
Lokk, all that stuff about flyin' to Vegas...
I don't mean nothing by else.
It's alright, I get it.
The owner of the house is a self employed C.P.A. named Richard Finney.
Thirty-three, Caucasian, he's got no priors.
There's something wrong.
I just feel it.
Nobody's comin' and you know it.
You wanna get outta here?
You're gonna have to do it yourself.
Listen, cover the back, right ?
Keep the head up.
I don't know what we're dealing with here.
Yeah I'm on it.
Lookin' for somebody?
#######
Did you hear something?
I'm not sure.
Double pepperoni with extra mushrooms?
Can I help you, officer?
Checked the house top to bottom.
There's nobody here.
Alright, we've got to get out here.
Roscoe get everybody out okay ?
Thank you.
Walt.
You can't just walk away.
There's nobody here, John.
What do you want me to say ?
We're missing something.
Is there anything else we can do?
No.
You've been very cooperative.
Thank you for your help.
We appreciated.
Mr. Smith?
He took you, too.
I beg your pardon?
You were abducted, weren't you?
What are you talking about?
We're looking for a missing girl, possible kidnapping.
If you have any information...
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not true.
I'm going to ask you to leave now.
Both of you.
Alright.
We're going.
Sorry sir.
I saw her.
I was there, I was in the room and I saw her.
That was strange.
Very.
What do you think it was all about?
I'm not sure.
Case of mistaken identity, I'd imagine.
Right.
That's probably what it was.
You okay?
Don't beat yourself up.
Nobody's right a 100% all the time.
I'm not wrong.
She's lying.
What do you want me to do?
Arrest her for denying a vision.
Roscoe.
I need you to hell over to Harrison Street.
- The Raintree motel?
- Room 16.
Bring the print guys with you.
And listen... anything that room knows, I want on my desk in two hours.
I'm on it.
Don't worry something will turn up right ?
And what if it doesn't Walt?
Walt!
I can help you find her.
He doesn't know what happened, does he?
He's a good man.
Decent.
He won't understand this.
What's this?
Have you been to the Raintree Motel?
I have.
Room 16.
I want you tell us about your abduction.
It was three years ago, December.
It was a cold night.
The kind of cold you feel deep down in your bones.
It was late.
I had worked all night long
I was tired.
I crossed between two buildings when he
when he grabbed me.
Listen Lindsa, it's okay.
You're safe here.
Alright?
He put his hand across my mouth.
I smelled chemicals, then I blacked out.
When I woke up, I was in a strange place...
Did he hurt you?
Not at first.
I was so frightened.
You're doing great.
Just try to relax.
He brought me pretty dresses and expensive make-up.
He had this way about him, gentle, but dangerous.
There were times I felt like I was the only woman left in the world.
He punished me when I made mistakes.
Mistakes?
What kind of mistakes Linda?
"The dress must never be wrinkled.
A neatly pressed dress makes for a clean and presentable woman."
"The makeup should be subtle.
Too much makes a woman look cheap.
Hair should be neatly combed and above the shoulders..."

Excuse me Linda, I'll be right back.
You're okay?
I'm fine.
Hello.
How's my beautiful wife?
Any news about Erica?
Well actually that's why I'm calling.
Bangor P.D. got a positive ID off the photo.
Her real name is Erica Carter.
There's a mother up on Glacier Lake.
But we haven't made contact yet.
Glacier Lake?
That's less than an hour from here.
I should have paid more attention.
Sarah, come on, it's not your fault.
We're so understaffed down at the community center,
I mean the phones don't even work half the time...

And now you tell me he's crossed the line.
He's gonna killed this girl, or did kill this girl, if we don't stop him.
John, I'm even don't know where to begin.
Maybe just begin at the end.
I flagged down a passing truck.
This road continues for another thirty miles along the river.
Linda, listen, we won't get in...
Here!
It was right here!
This is where he let me go.
It was dark and I was just standing there in the days... until the morning.
in a pouring rain.
There were other victims...
Six or seven maybe.
This guy, doesn't just abduct women he collects them.
That was Roscoe.
Two-lane service road intersects a freight line about 80 miles north of here.
Let's go find him.
Come on.
I don't need whatever it is your sellin'.
Mrs. Carter?
That's right.
Who are you?
My name is Sarah Bannerman.
I got your address from the Sheriff's department.
Sheriff?
You haven't been contacted yet?
I've been gone since morning'.
I know what this is.
I...
I told the man my car's been in the shop.
Your car?
No...
It's hard to hunt for a job without one.
I only need another few days to make things right.
I'm sorry, I don't think we are talking about the same thing?
You're here to collect the rent money.
No...
I'm here about Erica.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your daughter is missing.
Mrs Carter, did you hear me ?
I said that your daughter is in trouble.
I got no daughter.
Not for nearly three years.
What's that smell?
Not the blue plate special, I hope.
I'm gonna show the picture around... see if anybody recognizes her.
You're not eating.
I'm not hungry.
Mind if I ask you a personal question?
More personal than you wandering through my memories?
Why did you change your mind and decide to help us?
Do you have any idea what it's like to have your life torn in half?
To measure every second of your existence through the center line of one unimaginable event?
Surprisingly, I do.
Why take yourself back there ?
I want to see the look in his eyes.
The expression on his face when he sees me.
Redemption.
That's just a word.
You go through something and it changes you.
It holds a mirror up against everything that's ever, or ever will happen to you from that point forward.
In some ways you could say that my life began and ended while I was with him.
But you survived.
It's gotta count for someone ?
Life should be about more than survival, shouldn't it?
How 'bout some dessert?
No, thank you.
Just the check.
That smell outside?
- The lye.
- Excuse me?
Lye.
To make the soap.
The factory is 'bout 10 miles up the mountain
It's been closed for nearly three years, but you can still smell the lye when the wind kicks up.
I'm such a klutz.
Do you have a bathroom?
Underneath the big salmon, back in the corner.
I'm very... very sorry.
Don't worry about it, just an accident.
Two steak dinners, rare, with all the trimmings.
Looks like you got company?
Just a friend.
It's tonight.
There won't be lessons anymore.
Linda!
Linda, we gotta go.
Walt!
Did you see her?
Do see who?
Linda.
Did she come by here?
Not that I have known.
Why?
Oh, she took my car!
How the hell did she got my keys?
I'm such a klutz.
I'm very sorry.
Don't worry about it, just an accident.
She must have realized we were close to him.
She remembered something, a touch, a taste, a... smell.
You mentioned a soap factory?
Production plant's there.
But nobody goes up there anymore... except Mister Sudz.
Mister Sudz?
That's what everybody calls him.
I don't even know what his real name is.
He's the caretaker.
Personally, I don't know why anybody would want to live up there cut off from civilization.
was he in here earlier tonight?
Come to remember he was...
He ordered...
Two steak dinners to go.
That's right.
I saw Mister Sudz, Walt.
He was picking up food.
Same food that was on the table when Erica was killed.
We've got to go to that factory, hu ?
It's tough without a car.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
County Sheriff!
Stop your vehicle!
You comin' or what?
!
It seems somebody forgot to leave the lights on.
Not a bad place if your hobby is kidnapping.
Or murder.
At least we know she's here.
And why she took off.
What do you mean?
Shotgun's missing.
Probably came here to kill him.
This is Unit 1, requesting back-up on Rural Route 6, ten miles north of the Linwood Inn.
Over.
Roger, Unit 1.
Back-up units are 10:13 to your location.
Over.
Roger that.
Unit 1 out.
Hey, we can't wait for back-up.
They gonna be here in twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes?
This place is huge.
He could be anywhere.
He's going to kill her,
If Linda doesn't get to him first.
You ever see what a 12-gauge shotgun can do to a human body?
Put this on.
Let's go.
You stay here.
I'm gonna check the other side.
No way.
This girl is here because of me.
I'm not going to stand here
Fine, take this.
I don't do guns.
Besides, I might shoot you by mistake.
How would I explain that to Sarah and JJ?
I don't like the idea of leaving you unarmed.
Walt...
I'm a psychic, remember?
Alright.
I go on right.
I'm a psychic
You're gonna be a dead psychic.
Please!
Give me another chance.
I can be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need...
You showed me exactly where I needed to be.
Help me!
Anybody there?
Linda?
I don't expect you to understand this.
I don't completely understand it myself.
When this is over, I want you to tell them it was you that came after me.
Killing this guy is not going to fill up whatever is missing in your life.
You really can't see it, can you?
I have no intention of killing him.
I never did.
You've come back to be with him.
You opened up the door to feelings I'd forgotten.
Emotions I'd pushed out of my memory.
Linda, listen to me.
What you're going through, right know it's not your fault.
Ok?
It's called Stockholm Syndrome.
You don't understand...
It happens to people who've been kidnapped.
They begin to sympathize with their abductor.
Do you understand ?
That's not how this is...
It happened to Patty Hearst.
It happens to prisoners of war.
I don't want to hear anymore!
He's going to hurt you.
Not if she can be everything.
Not if she can be -- perfect.
Hello!
Is somebody there?
Yes, can you hear me ?
Help me!
Erica, you need to listen to me!
You know my name?
I'm locked down.
I'm in a room!
My name is Walt!
I'm the County Sheriff!
You have to come and get me!
He's gonna be back any second!
Listen, I can't get in this way!
I've got to find another way down!
No!
Don't leave me!
I'll be back!
I promise!
Allright ?
Hello!
Hello!
Don't panic.
Walt's coming.
Don't panic, Walt's coming.
Why did you come here?
For you.
I came for you.
Please.
Just give me another chance.
I'll be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need.
You're full of surprises, aren't you.
This can't be what you want.
You have no idea what she wants.
Is this what Erica wants?
To be killed by some lunatic so afraid that he lives his life hiding behind a plastic mask.
You know nothing.
I know you.
I know your mother was never good enough.
and your father demanded perfection.
That she could never give him.
Neither could his little boy.
How could you know that...
So you just keep searching for perfection, don't you ?
Perfection in faces of these women that you take.
Then you throw them away like garbage.
Get down on your knees.
I'm not going to tell you again!
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
We can just go.
Together.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We've got a Shalf dozen cruisers on the way to the hill right now.
You choose, Sheriff.
You can arrest me, and watch your friend die.
Or you can step aside.
It's your choice.
The tank!
NO!
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
We can just go.
Together.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Walt.
Put the gun !
We've got a Shalf dozen cruisers on the way to the hill right now.
You choose, Sheriff.
You can arrest me and you can watch your friend die.
You can step aside.
It's your choice.
Walt, listen to me.
You need to let this one go.
I've seen it before...
Alright,
Fine.
everybody just relax.
Take it easy.
Is it worth it, Linda?
You don't understand.
The factory is full of chemicals.
We have to find Erica
I spoke to her.
I know where she is, she's underneath this building.
Follow me.
Walt!
Put this on...
- Ok.
- Go, go, go!
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be okay.
I'll be right back, okay?
Is she gonna ok ?
She doesn't want to go to the hospital and she can't go home.
Now, you know what...
We could put that matelass out of the garage.
and put it the spare room.
Ya, We could do that.
I mean, she's gonna need someone to take care of her for awhile.
A little while, yeah?
A week... ten days tops.
I really think she can turn her life around, I do.
How could she miss with someone like you?
Ok...
What about Linda?
And what the hell is this that somebody go back to something like that?
Maybe for her the alternative was worse.
Yeah, maybe.
We all need to feel like we matter.
Even if it's just the pain.
Yeah.
My guys are sifting through the roughs trying to find her
Any chance that somebody survive a blow like that ?
It's very doubtfull.
He has brought us the most incredible today's special.
A multi-function conduction hoven that will really take care of all...
Just give me the damn phone number.
I'm so excited because we have all these ustensils and appliances.
Will they work together ?
Look at that.
I made a pizza dough in the food process.
Look at the....
I put even strench a bigger paddle.
My furnace not big enough.
Great.
It must be the fire department.
Sarah Banerman ?
Hey.
I was in the area.
What's that smell ?
Ho nothing.
I was just burning lunch.
Oh...
What was it supposed to be?
Grilled cheese.
Well, you got the "griled" part down.
Ever think about getting a housekeeper?
Just every time I get hungry.
Yeah.
So, what's up?
Oh, uh...
JJ mentioned something about you having an old baseball glove that he could use.
You're not have to come over here for that.
I could have dropped it by your house.
Unless, there's something else on your mind?
Tough to fool a psychic.
Yeah...
Yeah, ok, uh...
I've been doing some volunteer counseling down at the woman's outreach center.
They have a program for homeless women.
Sounds great.
It is.
Truth is, I think I probably get more out of it than the women in the program do.
What do you mean?
Well, with Walt working on these late hours and JJ becoming more and more independent...
Just have a lot of free time.
It feels good to give back, you know.
Sounds good.
But there is more, right?
There's this girl, her name is Erica.
I've been helping her through the job training program.
A few days ago she just stopped showing up.
I don't know, I just...
I have this feeling.
Feeling ?
What kind of feeling ?
That she's out there somewhere...
in trouble.
The center operates almost exclusively on private funding.
This is where Erica's work station was.
I don't wanna die.
Please!
Let me out of here!
Don't...
Did you see something?
Yeah.
We've got to talk to Walt.
This picture was taken a few weeks ago at the community center.
That's the girl I saw in my vision.
Do you have any idea where she was being held?
It looked like a little girl's bedroom.
Could be anywhere.
I checked all the emergency call center.
Nobody named Erica Carlson showed up missing.
If that's even her real name.
Why would she lie?
Women who come from abusive relationships.
Sometimes them don't want to be found.
Sarah, do you remember anything that she might have said?
Somebody bothering her.
An ex-boyfriend, something like that.
She didn't really talk about her personal life.
I should have tried to get closer.
I'll take the picture out on the streets, see if we can find anyone recognizes her.
I'll go with you.
We'll do our best to find her okay ?
Don't look at me.
Please I just want to go home.
I won't tell anybody, I promise.
Please, don't.
Please, I just want to go home.
I'll do anything you asked me to.
Just please don't...
Get dressed and fix your face.
Sorry,
Com'on.
Hold on a second!
I want to talk to you.
Sorry, officer, I was just waiting for my mother to pick me up.
Your mother?
For cheerleading practice.
Hey,
I know you!
No, I don't think so.
I never forget a face.
You're that mind-reading guy.
I've seen a picture in the newspaper.
You're way hotter in person.
Thank you.
Hey, y'wanna touch me and guess your future?
Sheriff, you wanna...
Do you recognize this girl?
My God
Do you know her?
I can't remember.
You can't remember.
Normally, it's too cold out here to give you girls a hard time.
But you stand in the way of a criminal investigation, I'll make it my top priority.
Her name is Erica...
Last name?
I don't know.
I swear!
She used to crash at my place when the weather got bad.
She's a colleague of yours?
She's a sweet kid.
End of story.
When was the last time you saw her?
I dunno, maybe a week ago.
She stashed some stuff at my place.
Do you mind if I take a look?
I normally do appointments.
Let me get this straight.
You can predict the winning Lotto numbers, but you don't?
It's kinda complicated.
It's crazy.
What's the point of having super-powers unless there's some cash in it?
Hey, why won't you just let the man do his job.
How long have you lived here Tamie?
Six months.
This place has been a transient motel for the last ten years.
Can you at least tell me if I have a shot at The Sweet Six?
You know what, I'll tell you what.
You ask one more question and I'll predict the next thirty days of your life.
And trust me, it ain't gonna include Ed McMahon walking through that door.
You keep money in this drawer.
I used to leave Erica a few dollars for pizza.
Walt I think we need to get going.
Tamie, thank you for your time.
Tell me one thing, will ya?
Yeah, if I can.
Is Erica ever coming back?
We're working on it.
So we just follow this bus until you see the house from your vision?
Yes, assuming it has any connection to Erica's disappearance.
Listen I just want to say thanks getting involved with this, John.
It means a lot to Sarah.
Cool.
So, how are things at home these days?
Good.
Why?
No, no reason.
Sarah did mention that JJ is growing up.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Nothing.
Just making conversation, that's all.
Well that's weird she would bring up something like that and then just drop it.
It's not like her.
Well, she did say...
Forget it.
It's just...
No, what?
I...
I think she feels neglecte, that's all.
Neglected?
She actually used the word negleted ?
It's only natural at this point in her life.
'Neglected'?
That's a little harsh, don't you John?
Walt, stop.
I know, I've been preoccupied with work.
But it's not like I work in a freakin' car wash.
Walt, stop.
You try listening to everybody's problems all day long.
Sometimes you just want to get on a plane and want go to freakin' Las Vegas, you know ?
- Walt!
Stop the car!
- What ?
What ?
Ho, this is the house from your vision?
That's it.
I'll call it in.
Get an ID on the owner.
Lokk, all that stuff about flyin' to Vegas...
I don't mean nothing by else.
It's alright, I get it.
The owner of the house is a self employed C.P.A. named Richard Finney.
Thirty-three, Caucasian, he's got no priors.
There's something wrong.
I just feel it.
Nobody's comin' and you know it.
You wanna get outta here?
You're gonna have to do it yourself.
Listen, cover the back, right ?
Keep the head up.
I don't know what we're dealing with here.
Yeah I'm on it.
Lookin' for somebody?
#######
Did you hear something?
I'm not sure.
Double pepperoni with extra mushrooms?
Can I help you, officer?
Checked the house top to bottom.
There's nobody here.
Alright, we've got to get out here.
Roscoe get everybody out okay ?
Thank you.
Walt.
You can't just walk away.
There's nobody here, John.
What do you want me to say ?
We're missing something.
Is there anything else we can do?
No.
You've been very cooperative.
Thank you for your help.
We appreciated.
Mr. Smith?
He took you, too.
I beg your pardon?
You were abducted, weren't you?
What are you talking about?
We're looking for a missing girl, possible kidnapping.
If you have any information...
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not true.
I'm going to ask you to leave now.
Both of you.
Alright.
We're going.
Sorry sir.
I saw her.
I was there, I was in the room and I saw her.
That was strange.
Very.
What do you think it was all about?
I'm not sure.
Case of mistaken identity, I'd imagine.
Right.
That's probably what it was.
You okay?
Don't beat yourself up.
Nobody's right a 100% all the time.
I'm not wrong.
She's lying.
What do you want me to do?
Arrest her for denying a vision.
Roscoe.
I need you to hell over to Harrison Street.
- The Raintree motel?
- Room 16.
Bring the print guys with you.
And listen... anything that room knows, I want on my desk in two hours.
I'm on it.
Don't worry something will turn up right ?
And what if it doesn't Walt?
Walt!
I can help you find her.
He doesn't know what happened, does he?
He's a good man.
Decent.
He won't understand this.
What's this?
Have you been to the Raintree Motel?
I have.
Room 16.
I want you tell us about your abduction.
It was three years ago, December.
It was a cold night.
The kind of cold you feel deep down in your bones.
It was late.
I had worked all night long
I was tired.
I crossed between two buildings when he
when he grabbed me.
Listen Lindsa, it's okay.
You're safe here.
Alright?
He put his hand across my mouth.
I smelled chemicals, then I blacked out.
When I woke up, I was in a strange place...
Did he hurt you?
Not at first.
I was so frightened.
You're doing great.
Just try to relax.
He brought me pretty dresses and expensive make-up.
He had this way about him, gentle, but dangerous.
There were times I felt like I was the only woman left in the world.
He punished me when I made mistakes.
Mistakes?
What kind of mistakes Linda?
"The dress must never be wrinkled.
A neatly pressed dress makes for a clean and presentable woman."
"The makeup should be subtle.
Too much makes a woman look cheap.
Hair should be neatly combed and above the shoulders..."
Please?
!
Give me another chance.
I can be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need.
There was a train whistle.
Right?
In the distance.
I'd nearly forgotten.
There's still run freight trains out of Bangor.
Linda, why hasn't you come to the police?
I was faceless.
Nameless.
Living on the streets.
Who was gonna believe me?
We will appreciate your help.
I just ask something in return.
What's that?
I want to come with you.
I want to be there when you find him.
We just got a hit off the photograph.
A positive ID on the missing girl.
I have to call Sarah, tell her I'll be late for dinner... again.
Excuse me Linda, I'll be right back.
You're okay?
I'm fine.
Hello.
How's my beautiful wife?
Any news about Erica?
Well actually that's why I'm calling.
Bangor P.D. got a positive ID off the photo.
Her real name is Erica Carter.
There's a mother up on Glacier Lake.
But we haven't made contact yet.
Glacier Lake?
That's less than an hour from here.
I should have paid more attention.
Sarah, come on, it's not your fault.
We're so understaffed down at the community center,
I mean the phones don't even work half the time...
It's amazing anyone gets any helped.
Listen, as soon as this is over, you and me are gonna take a little bit of time.
Two summers special.
- I gotta go, alright?
- Ok, I love you.
Yeah, me too.
I'll talk to you on bed.
Bye.
Let's go find this girl, come on.
Was this stuff in the Raintree?
Dusted the room for prints.
Did you get anything interesting?
Not unless you count two members of the Cleaves Mills city council, the Mayor's brother and the town librarian.
Beautiful.
Napkin.
Eat.
What is that?
It's my lipstick.
Why is it so hard for you to understand?
Why can't you see what I'm trying to do?
What is it?
I'll fix it.
Why does it have to be fixed?
!
Why can't you just do it right the first time?
No !
Look at yourself!
Do you think that's pretty?
Do you think that's what I want?
Do you?
!
You're just like the others.
Imperfect.
Flawed.
Disgusting.
Stop your blubbering.
I'm sorry.
I didn't
I show you kindness and this is how you repay me.
I didn't see anything...
I...
I won't say anything to anybody.
I promise..
I believe you.
We can try again.
I'll do better this time.
I promise.
I'm afraid our lessons are over.
What did you got ?
Erica, she tries to escape.
She sees his face and he kills her.
And you have no idea if what you saw is Erica's future or her past?
No, but either way we gotta keep looking right ?
There's nothing about this guy that feels remotely familiar too me.
He takes his victims and then lets them go.
He dresses them up and tears them down.
It's crazy.
Psychotic actually.
And now you tell me he's crossed the line.
He's gonna killed this girl, or did kill this girl, if we don't stop him.
John, I'm even don't know where to begin.
Maybe just begin at the end.
I flagged down a passing truck.
This road continues for another thirty miles along the river.
Linda, listen, we won't get in...
Here!
It was right here!
This is where he let me go.
It was dark and I was just standing there in the days... until the morning.
in a pouring rain.
There were other victims...
Six or seven maybe.
This guy, doesn't just abduct women he collects them.
That was Roscoe.
Two-lane service road intersects a freight line about 80 miles north of here.
Let's go find him.
Come on.
I don't need whatever it is your sellin'.
Mrs. Carter?
That's right.
Who are you?
My name is Sarah Bannerman.
I got your address from the Sheriff's department.
Sheriff?
You haven't been contacted yet?
I've been gone since morning'.
I know what this is.
I...
I told the man my car's been in the shop.
Your car?
No...
It's hard to hunt for a job without one.
I only need another few days to make things right.
I'm sorry, I don't think we are talking about the same thing?
You're here to collect the rent money.
No...
I'm here about Erica.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your daughter is missing.
Mrs Carter, did you hear me ?
I said that your daughter is in trouble.
I got no daughter.
Not for nearly three years.
What's that smell?
Not the blue plate special, I hope.
I'm gonna show the picture around... see if anybody recognizes her.
You're not eating.
I'm not hungry.
Mind if I ask you a personal question?
More personal than you wandering through my memories?
Why did you change your mind and decide to help us?
Do you have any idea what it's like to have your life torn in half?
To measure every second of your existence through the center line of one unimaginable event?
Surprisingly, I do.
Why take yourself back there ?
I want to see the look in his eyes.
The expression on his face when he sees me.
Redemption.
That's just a word.
You go through something and it changes you.
It holds a mirror up against everything that's ever, or ever will happen to you from that point forward.
In some ways you could say that my life began and ended while I was with him.
But you survived.
It's gotta count for someone ?
Life should be about more than survival, shouldn't it?
How 'bout some dessert?
No, thank you.
Just the check.
That smell outside?
- The lye.
- Excuse me?
Lye.
To make the soap.
The factory is 'bout 10 miles up the mountain
It's been closed for nearly three years, but you can still smell the lye when the wind kicks up.
I'm such a klutz.
Do you have a bathroom?
Underneath the big salmon, back in the corner.
I'm very... very sorry.
Don't worry about it, just an accident.
Two steak dinners, rare, with all the trimmings.
Looks like you got company?
Just a friend.
It's tonight.
There won't be lessons anymore.
Linda!
Linda, we gotta go.
Walt!
Did you see her?
Do see who?
Linda.
Did she come by here?
Not that I have known.
Why?
Oh, she took my car!
How the hell did she got my keys?
I'm such a klutz.
I'm very sorry.
Don't worry about it, just an accident.
She must have realized we were close to him.
She remembered something, a touch, a taste, a... smell.
You mentioned a soap factory?
Production plant's there.
But nobody goes up there anymore... except Mister Sudz.
Mister Sudz?
That's what everybody calls him.
I don't even know what his real name is.
He's the caretaker.
Personally, I don't know why anybody would want to live up there cut off from civilization.
was he in here earlier tonight?
Come to remember he was...
He ordered...
Two steak dinners to go.
That's right.
I saw Mister Sudz, Walt.
He was picking up food.
Same food that was on the table when Erica was killed.
We've got to go to that factory, hu ?
It's tough without a car.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
County Sheriff!
Stop your vehicle!
You comin' or what?
!
It seems somebody forgot to leave the lights on.
Not a bad place if your hobby is kidnapping.
Or murder.
At least we know she's here.
And why she took off.
What do you mean?
Shotgun's missing.
Probably came here to kill him.
This is Unit 1, requesting back-up on Rural Route 6, ten miles north of the Linwood Inn.
Over.
Roger, Unit 1.
Back-up units are 10:13 to your location.
Over.
Roger that.
Unit 1 out.
Hey, we can't wait for back-up.
They gonna be here in twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes?
This place is huge.
He could be anywhere.
He's going to kill her,
If Linda doesn't get to him first.
You ever see what a 12-gauge shotgun can do to a human body?
Put this on.
Let's go.
You stay here.
I'm gonna check the other side.
No way.
This girl is here because of me.
I'm not going to stand here
Fine, take this.
I don't do guns.
Besides, I might shoot you by mistake.
How would I explain that to Sarah and JJ?
I don't like the idea of leaving you unarmed.
Walt...
I'm a psychic, remember?
Alright.
I go on right.
I'm a psychic
You're gonna be a dead psychic.
Please!
Give me another chance.
I can be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need...
You showed me exactly where I needed to be.
Help me!
Anybody there?
Linda?
I don't expect you to understand this.
I don't completely understand it myself.
When this is over, I want you to tell them it was you that came after me.
Killing this guy is not going to fill up whatever is missing in your life.
You really can't see it, can you?
I have no intention of killing him.
I never did.
You've come back to be with him.
You opened up the door to feelings I'd forgotten.
Emotions I'd pushed out of my memory.
Linda, listen to me.
What you're going through, right know it's not your fault.
Ok?
It's called Stockholm Syndrome.
You don't understand...
It happens to people who've been kidnapped.
They begin to sympathize with their abductor.
Do you understand ?
That's not how this is...
It happened to Patty Hearst.
It happens to prisoners of war.
I don't want to hear anymore!
He's going to hurt you.
Not if she can be everything.
Not if she can be -- perfect.
Hello!
Is somebody there?
Yes, can you hear me ?
Help me!
Erica, you need to listen to me!
You know my name?
I'm locked down.
I'm in a room!
My name is Walt!
I'm the County Sheriff!
You have to come and get me!
He's gonna be back any second!
Listen, I can't get in this way!
I've got to find another way down!
No!
Don't leave me!
I'll be back!
I promise!
Allright ?
Hello!
Hello!
Don't panic.
Walt's coming.
Don't panic, Walt's coming.
Why did you come here?
For you.
I came for you.
Please.
Just give me another chance.
I'll be what you want.
I can be exactly what you need.
You're full of surprises, aren't you.
This can't be what you want.
You have no idea what she wants.
Is this what Erica wants?
To be killed by some lunatic so afraid that he lives his life hiding behind a plastic mask.
You know nothing.
I know you.
I know your mother was never good enough.
and your father demanded perfection.
That she could never give him.
Neither could his little boy.
How could you know that...
So you just keep searching for perfection, don't you ?
Perfection in faces of these women that you take.
Then you throw them away like garbage.
Get down on your knees.
I'm not going to tell you again!
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
We can just go.
Together.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We've got a Shalf dozen cruisers on the way to the hill right now.
You choose, Sheriff.
You can arrest me, and watch your friend die.
Or you can step aside.
It's your choice.
The tank!
NO!
I don't want to hurt you, but I will.
We can just go.
Together.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Walt.
Put the gun !
We've got a Shalf dozen cruisers on the way to the hill right now.
You choose, Sheriff.
You can arrest me and you can watch your friend die.
You can step aside.
It's your choice.
Walt, listen to me.
You need to let this one go.
I've seen it before...
Alright,
Fine.
everybody just relax.
Take it easy.
Is it worth it, Linda?
You don't understand.
The factory is full of chemicals.
We have to find Erica
I spoke to her.
I know where she is, she's underneath this building.
Follow me.
Walt!
Put this on...
- Ok.
- Go, go, go!
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be okay.
I'll be right back, okay?
Is she gonna ok ?
She doesn't want to go to the hospital and she can't go home.
Now, you know what...
We could put that matelass out of the garage.
and put it the spare room.
Ya, We could do that.
I mean, she's gonna need someone to take care of her for awhile.
A little while, yeah?
A week... ten days tops.
I really think she can turn her life around, I do.
How could she miss with someone like you?
Ok...
What about Linda?
And what the hell is this that somebody go back to something like that?
Maybe for her the alternative was worse.
Yeah, maybe.
We all need to feel like we matter.
Even if it's just the pain.
Yeah.
My guys are sifting through the roughs trying to find her
Any chance that somebody survive a blow like that ?
It's very doubtfull.
Stop now.
Tell me where it is.
You and your brethren possess what is not rightfully yours.
I don't know what you are talking about.
Is it a secret you will die for?
-Please.
-As you wish.
Wait!
My God, forgive me.
In the sacristy the church of Saint-Sulpice, is the Rose Line.
Beneath the Rose.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Symbols are a language that can help us understand our past.
As the saying goes, a picture says a thousand words but which words?
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.
-Hatred, racism.
-Ku Klux Klan.
Yes, yes, interesting.
But they would disagree with you in Spain.
There, they are robes worn by priests.
Now this symbol.
Anyone?
Evil.
In English, please.
Devil's pitchfork.
Poor, poor Poseidon.
That is his trident.
A symbol of power to millions of the ancients.
Now this symbol.
-Madonna and child.
-Faith.
Christianity.
No.
No, it's the pagan god Horus and his mother, lsis centuries before the birth of Christ.
Understanding our past determines actively our ability to understand the present.
So how do we sift truth from belief?
How do we write our own histories, personally or culturally and thereby define ourselves?
How do we penetrate years, centuries, of historical distortion to find original truth?
Tonight, this will be our quest.
My son is a student of yours at Harvard.
-Michael Culp?
He adores you.
-Oh, yeah.
He says you're the best teacher he's ever had.
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave Michael an A-minus.
He told me.
Thank you.
Mr. Langdon?
Hi.
Bonjour, professor.
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French fbi.
Will you take a look at this photo, please?
My police chief, Capitaine Fache, had hoped considering your expertise and the markings on the body you might assist us.
Will you excuse me a moment?
I was supposed to have drinks with him.
Yes, we know.
We found your name in his daily planner.
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.
Why would someone do this to him?
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.
He was shot, yes.
But what you see in the photograph Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.
Teacher, all four are dead.
The senechaux and the Grand Master himself.
Then I assume you have the location.
Confirmed by all.
lndependently.
I had feared the Priory's penchant for secrecy might prevail.
The prospect of death is strong motivation.
It is here.
In Paris, Teacher.
It hides beneath the Rose in Saint-Sulpice.
You will go forth, Silas.
I chastise my body.
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.
Okay.
-Mr.
Langdon.
-Yes.
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.
You like our pyramid?
It's magnificent.
A scar on the face of Paris.
After me, please.
It's the pairing of those two pyramids.
It's unique.
The two are geometric echoes.
Fascinating.
I'm not sure how much help I'm gonna be here this evening.
How well did you know the curator?
Not very well.
Frankly, I was surprised when he contacted me.
Could we take the stairs?
So Sauniere requested tonight's meeting.
Yes.
How?
Did he call you?
E-mail.
He heard I was in Paris.
Had something to discuss.
What?
You seem uncomfortable.
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.
How would you know that?
I recognize the parquet floor from the Polaroid.
It's unmistakable.
Dear God.
Let's cover the talking points again, Your Eminence.
Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.
Others, an ultraconservative Christian secret society.
Obviously, some people fear what they don't understand.
Perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence.
The press continue to be harsh with us.
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.
We don't pick and choose which rules to follow.
We follow doctrine.
Rigorously.
Does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing and atonement for sins through self-flagellation and the cilice?
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.
Only a small proportion choose to live ascetic lives.
-Why are some media referring--?
-That will be all, Michael, thank you.
Aringarosa.
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.
It hides beneath the Rose.
My part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled.
I meet the council in an hour.
I will have your money tonight, Teacher.
The Vitruvian Man.
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches.
And the star on his skin?
A pentacle.
And its meaning?
The pentacle is a pagan religious icon.
Devil worship.
No.
No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.
This is a symbol for Venus.
It represents the female half of all things--
You are telling me that Sauniere's last act on earth was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest?
Why?
Captain Fache, obviously I can't tell you why.
I can tell you he, as well as anyone, knows the meaning of this symbol and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil.
-Is that so?
-Yes.
Then what do you make of this?
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."
It's a phrase.
Doesn't mean anything, not to me.
What would you do if you had such limited time to send a message?
Well, I suppose I'd try to identify my killer.
Precisely.
Precisely.
So, professor--
Officer Neveu.
Please, pardon the interruption.
This is not the time.
I received the crime-scene jpegs at headquarters and I've deciphered the code.
It's a Fibonacci sequence.
That's the code Sauniere left on the floor.
Headquarters sent me to explain, captain.
It is the Fibonacci sequence.
The numbers are out of order.
But before that, I have an urgent message for Professor Langdon.
Right?
Pardon me?
I'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology.
Your embassy called Division.
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said it was a matter of life and death.
This is the number of your embassy's messaging service.
Well, thank you.
Hello, you've reached the home of Sophie Neveu.
Miss Neveu?
This....
No.
That's the right number.
You have to dial an access code to pick up your messages.
But I'm getting--
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.
Professor Langdon, do not react to this message.
You must follow my directions very closely and, above all reveal nothing to Captain Fache.
You are in grave danger.
Church of Saint-Sulpice.
Good evening, Sister.
I need you to show someone our church tonight.
Of course, Father.
But so late?
Wouldn't tomorrow...?
This is a request from an important bishop of Opus Dei.
It would be my pleasure.
There's been an accident.
A friend.
I have to fly home in the morning.
I see.
Is there a restroom I could use?
I just wanna splash some water on my face.
Yes.
She said it is meaningless.
Mathematical joke.
Is it meaningless?
I'll take another look when I come back.
I'm sorry.
Of course.
Do you have a message from Sauniere?
What are you talking about?
Crazy old man.
You have me confused with someone else.
I came here to--
Check your jacket pocket.
Just look.
GPS tracking dot.
Accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe.
The agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket in case you tried to run.
We have you on a little leash, professor.
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.
So, what do you think about the fourth line of text Fache wiped clean before you arrived?
He brought you here to force a confession, Professor Langdon.
He's still in there?
What's he doing?
Fache isn't even looking for other suspects, okay?
He is sure you're guilty.
When did Sauniere contact you?
-Today?
-Yes, yes.
What time?
What time?
At 3.
Around 3.
Three.
We call Fache "the Bull." Once he starts, he doesn't stop.
He can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case.
And by then whatever Sauniere wanted you to tell me will be useless.
Stop it!
Just stop!
Who are you?
Look at the letters.
" P.S."
P.S., postscript.
" Princesse Sophie." Silly, I know.
But I was only a girl when I lived with him.
Jacques Sauniere was my grandfather.
Apparently, it was his dying wish that we meet.
If you help me understand why I will get you to your embassy, where we cannot arrest you.
Fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here, was he?
No.
If we are to get away from here, we must find another way.
What exactly do you propose?
Sauniere was reading his book.
" Blood trail."
Excuse me, captain.
We have a problem.
Headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.
What?
Captain, look at this.
He jumped!
Shit.
He's moving again.
And fast.
He must be in a car.
He's going south on Pont du Carrousel.
Bastard.
That cop will check the whole lower floor.
I will only take a moment.
Of course.
He is much older than I remember.
I hadn't seen or spoken to him in a very long time.
He phoned my office today.
Several times.
He said it was a matter of life and death.
I thought it was another trick to get back in touch.
It seems when he couldn't speak to me he reached out to you.
-Wait a minute.
-Professor?
This is wrong.
Yeah.
See?
This is wrong.
The Fibonacci numbers only make sense when they're in order.
These are scrambled.
If he was trying to reach out, maybe he was doing it in code.
Would you hold this, please?
This phrase is meaningless.
Unless you assume these letters are out of order too.
An anagram.
You have eidetic memory?
Not quite.
But I can pretty much remember what I see.
Anagram is right.
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint" becomes:
" Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa."
Professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here.
Look at this.
He must have thrown it from the window.
Smart to hit the truck.
What, you admire him now?
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?
Ledoux?
Get him on the radio!
Her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies.
The horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right.
Why?
Well, see, she appears larger from the left than on the right.
Historically, the left was female, the right was male.
There.
Blood.
Hey.
"So dark the con of man."
No.
It doesn't say that.
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?
Professor, hurry.
Hurry!
Moon.
Sermon.
Charms.
Demons.
Omens.
Codes.
Monks.
Ranks.
Rocks.
Madonna of the Rocks.
Da Vinci.
Careful.
Careful.
This can't be this.
The fleur-de-lis.
It was Sauniere's.
I remember finding it once when I was a girl.
He'd promised he'd give it to me one day.
Have you ever heard those words before, Sophie?
"So dark the con of man"?
No.
Have you?
When you were a child, were you aware of any secret gatherings?
Anything ritualistic in nature?
Meetings your grandfather would've wanted k ept secret?
Was there ever any talk of something called the Priory of Sion?
The what?
Why are you asking these things?
The Priory of Sion is a myth.
One of the world's oldest and most secret societies, with leaders like Sir Isaac Newton, da Vinci himself.
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.
They're guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to as "the dark con of man."
But what secret?
The Priory of Sion protects the source of God's power on earth.
I can't do this by myself.
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.
Please.
Even if we could get out of this--
Okay.
No, no, no.
You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!
Well, that was....
We need to get out of sight.
Christ, give me strength.
You are a ghost.
Christ, give me strength.
Stealing in a house of God!
You are an angel.
Christ, give me strength.
You have powerful friends.
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.
I could not miss this chance to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.
The light is not ideal.
Tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line.
A rose line is any line that goes from the North to South Poles.
Set into the streets of Paris, 1 35 brass markers mark the world's first prime meridian which passed through this very church.
It hides beneath the Rose.
I'm sorry?
Sister.
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.
I insist.
May the peace of the Lord be with you.
And with you.
They found Neveu's car abandoned at the train station.
And two tickets to Brussels paid for with Langdon's credit card.
A decoy, I'm sure.
All the same, send an officer to the station.
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.
Interpol?
We're not sure he's guilty.
I know he's guilty.
Beyond a doubt.
Robert Langdon is guilty.
This is the Bois de Boulogne?
We should be safe in this park for a few minutes.
Stay here.
Police.
What do you want?
Fifty euros for all your stuff.
Go and get something to eat.
Did it occur to you that could be dangerous?
No.
And now we have a place to think.
Any ideas, professor?
You could've just handed me a piece of a UFO from Area 51 .
"What's the next step?"
With him, it's always:
"Sophie, what's the next step?"
Puzzles.
Codes.
A treasure hunt.
To find his killer.
Maybe there is something about this Priory of Sion.
I hope not.
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.
It all started over a thousand years ago when a French king conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.
This crusade, one of the most massive and sweeping in history was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood the Priory of Sion and their military arm, the Knights Templar.
But the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land.
That was a cover to hide their true goal, according to this myth.
Supposedly the invasion was to find an artefact lost since the time of Christ.
An artefact, it was said, the Church would kill to possess.
Did they find it, this buried treasure?
Put it this way:
One day the Templars simply stopped searching.
They quit the Holy Land and travelled directly to Rome.
Whether they blackmailed the papacy or the Church bought their silence, no one knows.
But it is a fact the papacy declared these Priory knights these Knights Templar, of limitless power.
By the 1 300s, the Templars had grown too powerful.
Too threatening.
So the Vatican issued secret orders to be opened simultaneously all across Europe.
The Pope had declared the Knights Templar Satan worshipers and said God had charged him with cleansing the earth of these heretics.
The plan went off like clockwork.
The Templars were all but exterminated.
The date was October 1 3th, 1 30 7.
A Friday.
Friday the 1 3th.
The Pope sent troops to claim the Priory's treasure but they found nothing.
The few surviving Knights of the Priory had vanished and the search for their sacred artefact began again.
What artefact?
I've never heard about any of this.
Yes, you have.
Almost everyone on earth has.
You just know it as the Holy Grail.
Please, Sauniere thought he knew the location of the Holy Grail?
Maybe more than that.
This cross and the flower, this could be very old.
But look.
This metal here underneath is much newer, and there's a modern lD stamp.
" Haxo 24."
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.
He left us, professor.
And vingt-quatre Haxo, it's not an id stamp.
It's a street address.
This is Jacques Sauniere.
Please leave a message after the tone.
Please, Monsieur Sauniere, pick up the phone.
This is Sandrine Bieil.
I have called the list.
I fear the other guardians are dead.
The lie has been told.
The floor panel has been broken.
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.
Job 38, verse 1 1 .
Do you know it, Sister?
Job 38: 1 1 .
Hitherto shalt thou come but no further.
" But no further."
Do you mock me?
Where is the keystone?
I do not know.
No.
You are a sister of the Church and yet you serve them:
the Priory.
Jesus had but one true message.
That--
Come, you saints of God.
Hasten, angels of the Lord.
To receive her soul.
And bring her to the sight of the Almighty.
Welcome, bishop.
This council is convened.
Our words shall never pass these walls.
What business, say you?
As you know, my request for funds--
Yes, 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds.
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, bishop?
I only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men.
How humble.
Our saviour, Bishop Aringarosa.
How dare you presume to--
I do not presume, I act!
The Vatican's unwillingness to support us is both impious and cowardly.
Blood is being spilled because true Christian values lie in ruins.
No more!
This council has forgotten its very purpose.
Tonight the Grail will be destroyed.
The Priory's few remaining members will be silenced.
I was contacted by a man who calls himself only "the Teacher."
Two prostitutes identified Langdon and Neveu getting into a taxi in the Bois de Boulogne.
Because of your expertise?
-I'm sorry?
-About the Priory.
Do you think that's why Sauniere sought you out?
I can think of dozens of scholars who know a lot more about it.
Actually, I didn't think he liked me very much.
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.
What was it?
How may I help you?
The door to the right, please.
Good evening.
I am Andre Vernet, the night manager.
I take it this is your first visit to our establishment?
Yes.
Understood.
Keys are often passed on and first-time users are sometimes uncertain of protocol.
Keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts.
Often willed through generations.
Is it yours, mademoiselle?
The shortest safety-deposit-box lease is 50 years.
And what's your longest account?
Quite a bit longer.
Technologies change, keys are updated.
Once the computer confirms your key enter your account number and your box is retrieved.
The room is yours, as long as you like.
What if I lost track of my account number?
How might I recover it?
I'm afraid each key is paired with a 1 0-digit number known only to the account bearer.
I hope you manage to remember it.
A single wrong entry disables the system.
-Ten.
-Ten.
Your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.
Scrambled, unscrambled?
Unscrambled.
It's your key.
Funny, I don't even like history.
I've never seen much good come from looking to the past.
Moment of truth.
My God.
I don't believe this.
A rose.
The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail.
Forgive the intrusion.
I'm afraid the police arrived more quickly than I anticipated.
You must follow me, please.
For your own safety.
You knew they were coming?
My guard alerted me to your status when you arrived.
Yours is one of our oldest and highest-level accounts.
It includes a safe-passage clause.
Safe passage?
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.
In there?
Hey, is there a problem?
Good evening, sir.
Police.
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?
-English?
-Yes.
We are looking for two criminals.
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.
Would you mind opening the hold?
Please.
You think they trust us, the wages I get paid?
You don't have keys to your own truck?
It's armoured.
Keys get sent to the destination.
You mind?
I'm on a schedule here.
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?
What?
This piece of shit.
Forty euros in Barbes.
Yours for 35.
No, no, no.
-Thirty.
-No.
It's okay, it's okay.
Come on, 30, eh?
I said, no!
Move along!
Now we wait.
The Teacher will call and tell me where to deliver the money.
You have put tremendous faith in this Teacher of yours.
Yes, I have.
And I have given him an angel to do his will.
For surely there is no better soldier for God than my Silas.
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins to do penance and to amend my life.
Amen.
The Holy Grail.
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.
It's nonsense.
You don't believe in God.
No.
Just people.
Sometimes that they can be kind.
Are you a God-fearing man, professor?
I was raised a Catholic.
Well, that's not really an answer.
Professor, are you okay?
Go ahead, open it.
Go on.
A cryptex.
They are used to keep secrets.
It's da Vinci's design.
You write the information on a papyrus scroll which is then rolled around a thin glass vial of vinegar.
If you force it open, the vial breaks vinegar dissolves papyrus and your secret is lost forever.
The only way to access the information is to spell out the password with these five dials, each with 26 letters.
That's 1 2 million possibilities.
I've never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex.
Sauniere made one for me once.
My grandfather gave me a wagon.
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.
Come on.
Please, you're not all right.
May I try something?
I don't know why it works.
My mother used to do it when I was scared, I think.
You think?
Yes.
Feeling better, Sophie?
My parents died in a car crash with my brother.
I was 4.
I'm sorry.
It was many years ago.
Better?
Yeah.
Okay.
Twenty years waiting for someone to come for that box and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.
I don't know what you're talking about.
All right!
Okay!
Right now!
Step back!
No one will lose sleep over a couple on a killing spree.
Turn around.
Turn around!
You too, mademoiselle.
Sophie!
Get in the truck!
I'll drive!
Hurry!
What happened between you and your grandfather, exactly?
I've jammed my shoulder, I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.
I need to know.
You say he raised you, but you two don't talk anymore.
You call him by his last name.
You say you hate history.
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.
So now you're a psychologist too?
What if Sauniere had started to groom you for the Priory?
What do you mean, groom me?
Your grandfather gave you puzzles and cryptex as a child.
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?
We've been dragged into a world of people who think this stuff is real.
-Real enough to kill for.
-Who?
I'm out of my field here.
I do know a Grail historian, absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.
An Englishman, lives here in France.
Do you trust this man?
I hope you can.
Vernet, Andre.
It seems you're not a driver at all.
Apparently, you lost your tongue along with your truck.
You think you're in pain now, Andre Vernet?
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?
What do you want?
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.
Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.
It's on the wrong side.
Leigh likes all things to be English, including his cars.
Robert!
Do I owe you money?
Leigh, my friend care to open up for an old colleague?
-Of course.
-Thank you.
But first, a test of honour.
Three questions.
Fire away.
Your first.:
Shall I serve coffee or tea?
Tea, of course.
Excellent.
Second.: milk or lemon?
Milk?
That would depend on the tea.
Correct.
And now the third and most grave of inquiries.:
In which year did a Harvard sculler outrow an Oxford man at Henley?
Surely such a travesty has never occurred.
Your heart is true.
You may pass.
Welcome to Chateau Villette.
The truck's signal is coming online.
It's about time.
Locked on and tracking, sir.
Very good.
Tell Collet not to move in until I get there.
Attention!
All of Collet's units to Chateau Villette.
The suspects Neveu and Langdon are lik ely at that location.
Aringarosa.
I still don't know why he put you into this and I'm sorry.
But I'm also very glad.
You are requested to make yourself at home.
Robert!
And you travel with a maiden, it seems.
Sir Leigh Teabing, may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.
It's an honour to welcome you even though it's late.
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.
So late, mademoiselle, it's almost early.
What a lovely smile you have.
Earl Grey?
Lemon.
Correct.
Chateau Villette.
Yes.
A dramatic late-night arrival.
What can an old cripple do for you, Robert?
We wanna talk about the Priory of Sion.
The keepers?
The secret war?
Sorry for all the mystery.
Leigh, I'm into something here that I cannot understand.
You?
-Really?
-Not without your help.
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.
Not if it works.
There are always four:
The Grand Master and the three senechaux make up the primary guardians of the Grail.
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.
The Priory's members span our very globe itself.
Philippe de Cherisey exposed that as a hoax in 1967.
And that is what they want you to believe.
The Priory is charged with a single task:
To protect the greatest secret in modern history.
The source of God's power on earth.
No, that's a common misunderstanding.
The Priory protects the source of the Church's power on earth:
The Holy Grail.
I don't understand.
What power?
Some magic dishes?
Robert.
Has he been telling you that the Holy Grail is a cup?
The Good Book did not arrive by facsimile from heaven.
The Bible as we know it was finally presided over by one man:
The pagan emperor Constantine.
I thought Constantine was a Christian.
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan who was baptized on his deathbed.
Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man.
From time immemorial his people had worshiped a balance between nature's male deities and the goddess, or sacred feminine.
But a growing religious turmoil was gripping Rome.
Three centuries earlier a young Jew named Jesus had come along preaching love and a single God.
Centuries after his crucifixion Christ's followers had grown exponentially and had started a religious war against the pagans.
Or did the pagans commence war against the Christians?
Leigh, we can't be sure who began the atrocities in that period.
We can at least agree that the conflict grew to such proportions that it threatened to tear Rome in two.
So Constantine may have been a lifelong pagan but he was also a pragmatist.
And in 325 anno Domini he decided to unify Rome under a single religion, Christianity.
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.
And to strengthen this new Christian tradition Constantine held a famous ecumenical gathering known as the Council of Nicaea.
And at this council the many sects of Christianity debated and v oted on, well everything, from the acceptance and rejection of specific gospels to the date for Easter to the administering of the sacraments, and of course the immortality of Jesus.
I don't follow.
Well, ma chere, until that moment in history Jesus was viewed by many of his followers as a mighty prophet as a great and powerful man, but a man nevertheless.
A mortal man.
Not the Son of God?
Not even his nephew twice removed.
Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity.
He simply sanctioned an already widely held idea.
-Semantics.
-No, it's not semantics.
You're interpreting facts to support your own conclusions.
Fact:
For many Christians, Jesus was mortal one day and divine the next.
For some Christians, his divinity was enhanced.
Absurd.
There was a formal announcement of his promotion.
They couldn't even agree on the Nicene Creed!
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"
How many have been murdered over this question?
As long as there has been a one true God there has been killing in his name.
Now let me show you the Grail.
I trust you recognize The Last Supper the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci.
Now, my dear, if you would close your eyes.
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlour tricks.
You asked for my help, I recall.
Allow an old man his indulgences.
Now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting?
-In the middle.
-Good.
He and his disciples are breaking bread.
And what drink?
Wine.
They drank wine.
Splendid.
And one final question:
How many wineglasses are there on the table?
One?
The Holy Grail?
Open your eyes.
No single cup.
No chalice.
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?
Considering both the Bible and standard Grail legend celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.
Now, Robert, you could be of help to us.
If you'd be so kind as to show us the symbols for man and woman, please.
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.
-Quite to the point.
-Yes, indeed.
This is known as the blade.
It represents aggression and manhood.
It's a symbol still used today in modern military uniforms.
Yes, the more penises you have, the higher your rank.
Boys will be boys.
Now, as you would imagine, the female symbol is its exact opposite.
This is called the chalice.
And the chalice resembles a cup or vessel or, more importantly the shape of a woman's womb.
No, the Grail has never been a cup.
It is quite literally this ancient symbol of womanhood.
And in this case, a woman who carried a secret so powerful that if revealed, it would devastate the very foundations of Christianity.
Wait, please.
You're saying the Holy Grail is a person?
A woman?
And it turns out, she makes an appearance right there.
But they are all men.
Are they?
What about that figure on the right hand of our Lord seated in the place of honour?
Flowing red hair.
Folded feminine hands.
Hint of a bosom.
No?
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.
Who is she?
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.
The prostitute?
She was no such thing.
Smeared by the Church in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.
This is an old wives' tale.
The original one, in fact.
There's virtually no empirical proof.
He knows as well as I do there's much evidence to support it.
Theories.
There are theories.
Notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed.
Mirror images of each other.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.
And venturing into the even more bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary appear to be joined at the hip and are leaning away from each other as if to create a shape in the negative space between them.
Leonardo gives us the chalice.
Yes.
Oh, and Robert, notice what happens when these two figures change position.
Just because da Vinci painted it doesn't make it true.
No.
But history she does make it true.
Now, listen to this.
It's from the Gospel according to Philip.
Philip?
Yes, it was rejected at the Council of Nicaea along with any other gospels that made Jesus appear human and not divine.
"And the companion of the Saviour is Mary Magdalene.
Christ loved her more than all the disciples and used to kiss her on the--"
But this says nothing of marriage.
Well, actually....
Robert.
Actually, in those days, the word "companion" literally meant "spouse."
And this is from the Gospel of Mary Magdalene herself.
-She wrote a gospel?
-She may have.
-Robert, will you fight fair?
-She may have.
"And Peter said, 'Did he prefer her to us?
'
And Levi answered:
'Peter, I see you contending against a woman like an adversary.
If the Saviour made her worthy, who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'
Yes.
And then, my dear, Jesus goes on to tell Mary Magdalene that it's up to her to continue his Church.
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.
The Church was supposed to be carried on by a woman.
Few realize that Mary was descended from kings, just as her husband was.
Now, my dear, the word in French for Holy Grail.
From the Middle English "Sangreal" of the original Arthurian legend.
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?
Sang real, it means " royal blood."
When the legend speaks of the chalice that held the blood of Christ it speaks in fact of the female womb that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.
But how could Christ have a bloodline, unless--?
Mary was pregnant at the time of the Crucifixion.
For her own safety and for that of Christ's unborn child she fled the Holy Land and came to France.
And here, it is said, she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.
They know the child's name.
-A little girl.
-Yes.
If that were true, it's adding insult to injury.
Why?
The pagans found transcendence through the joining of male to female.
People found God through sex?
In paganism, women were worshiped as a route to heaven but the modern Church has a monopoly on that in salvation through Jesus Christ.
And he who keeps the keys to heaven rules the world.
Women, then, are a huge threat to the Church.
The Catholic Inquisition soon publishes what may be the most blood-soak ed book in human history.
The Malleus Maleficarum.
The Witches' Hammer.
It instructed the clergy on how to locate, torture and kill all freethinking women.
In three centuries of witch hunts 50, 000 women are captured, burned alive at the stak e.
Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.
Imagine, then, Robert that Christ's throne might live on in a female child.
You asked what would be worth killing for.
Witness the greatest cover-up in human history.
This is the secret that the Priory of Sion has defended for over 20 centuries.
They are the guardians of the royal bloodline.
The keepers of the proof of our true past.
They are the protectors of the living descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene.
Sir Leigh?
Sometimes I wonder who is serving whom.
His sauces are not that fantastic.
Yes, can I help you?
Yes.
They're on the news now.
Living descendants?
Is it possible?
It's not impossible.
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.
You are wanted for four murders!
That's why Vernet said " killing spree."
You come into my home, playing on my passions for the Grail.
-That's why he needed you.
-You will leave my house!
-Leigh, listen!
-No, I'm calling the police.
Jacques Sauniere was her grandfather.
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.
You still keep lists of who might be in the Priory?
I'll bet Jacques Sauniere was on one of those lists.
He was on your list of who could be Grand Master, wasn't he?
-What?
-I'll bet he was right at the top.
Consider:
Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.
What if the Priory was compromised, the other senechaux dead?
What if you yourself were dying, a Grand Master?
You'd have to pass the secret on to someone you could trust.
Someone outside the society.
Maybe someone whose training you had begun but never finished.
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.
Not really.
No, that's impossible.
Can that really--?
Is it the keystone?
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.
Will you just tell us what the hell it's for?
Fache says to wait, so I wait.
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here.
They're inside.
Yes.
As the legend foretold:
" It hides beneath the Rose."
Oh, my.
Leigh.
Leigh?
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yes, of course.
Inside the keystone there'll be a map.
A map that will lead us to the Holy Grail.
To be trained by the Grand Master himself.
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?
And he must have sung you the riddle songs.
I know some of them.
Can you keep secrets?
Can you know a thing and never say it again?
And codes?
I imagine they lie down for you like lovers.
A senechal.
A guardian of the Grail right here in my own home.
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem--
Robert!
Do not move, woman.
Cripple.
Put the box on the table.
What, this trifle?
Well, perhaps we can make a financial arrangement.
Put the keystone on the table.
You will not succeed.
Only the worthy can unlock the stone.
Rip the gate down.
Well, well, my dear.
Sit down.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.
-Are you?
-Yeah.
Yes, well, make yourself useful, you French fool.
Get something to restrain this monster.
Above the joint.
Fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay.
He's wearing a cilice.
-A what?
-Well, look.
lnflicts pain so he can suffer as Christ suffered.
Opus Dei.
Fache is Opus Dei.
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.
Robert.
Well, I must say, you two are anything but dull.
Leigh?
You want what's in this box?
We need a way out of here.
Well, actually I do have a plane.
-Robert!
Where do we go?
-Come along.
-In here.
Come in.
-Over here.
Get the door.
Hurry.
Over here.
Over here.
Sophie.
Watch out!
Be careful.
Come, Rem--
Shit.
Easy.
Jesus!
Apropos.
I can't imagine what your complaint is.
I'd be within my rights to shoot you and let you rot in my woods!
Put that away.
We might need him.
Better.
Opus Dei.
-What is it?
-A conservative Catholic sect.
Opus Dei is a prelature to the Vatican.
You're saying the Vatican is killing people for this box?
No, no, no.
Not the Vatican and not Opus Dei, but we are in the middle of a war.
And one that has been going on forever.
On the one side stands the Priory and on the other an ancient group of despots with members hidden in high-ranking positions throughout the Church.
And this Council of Shadows tries to destroy proof of the bloodline.
And that throughout history, they seek out and kill the living descendants of Jesus Christ.
-That's insane.
-Is it?
What if the world discovers that the greatest story ever told is actually a lie?
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith unprecedented.
I've got a signal now, sir.
It's ringing.
Roger, look, I'm so sorry.
I've got tired of the weather here in France and could you make the plane ready for Zurich.
Yes.
No, we love Zurich.
What the hell do you mean, you lost them?
Collet.
You're the one who lost them.
You control every step of this investigation.
You don't let anybody breathe.
You're acting like you lost your mind.
What is it with these two birds?
Interpol just registered a new flight plan from Le Bourget.
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.
Did you kill Jacques Sauniere?
Did you kill Jacques Sauniere?
I am the messenger of God.
Did you kill my grandfather?
I am the messenger--
Each breath you take is a sin.
No shadow will be safe again.
For you will be hunted by angels.
You believe in God?
Your God doesn't forgive murderers.
He burns them.
Sophie.
The Teacher will be pleased.
What will you do once you have the Grail?
Destroy it.
The documents and the sarcophagus, of course.
And the heir?
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?
There will be no need.
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed, DNA testing will be impossible.
There is no way to prove a living bloodline.
But if you had to would you do as councils have done before us?
Christ....
Christ sacrificed his life for the betterment of humanity.
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.
I need the flight plan.
Ten minutes.
I asked you to get it for me.
I'm on break.
Come back in 10 minutes.
My nose!
My nose!
The flight plan, please.
You asshole!
It's not "cross."
"Spear"?
What happened to her?
No one knows.
Mary Magdalene lived out her days in hiding.
And the zealots pursued her still even in death, trying to destroy proof of her existence.
But she always had her Knights.
Brave men sworn to defend her.
You see, to worship before her sarcophagus to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene was to remember all those who were robbed of their power who were oppressed.
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains and the proof of her bloodline until most believed her sarcophagus the Holy Grail was finally lost in time.
What are you doing?
At the chateau, you said, " It hides beneath the Rose."
No, no, no.
Do be careful.
In Latin, sub rosa.
Literal translation....
" Beneath the rose."
We need a mirror.
Backwards.
In the style of Leonardo himself.
Thank you.
In London lies a knight a Pope interred
His labour's fruit a Holy wrath incurred
You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb
It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb
" In London lies a knight a Pope interred"?
A knight whose funeral was presided over by the Pope.
Of course, the Priory knights were not just any knights.
Templars.
And there's just one place to bury a Templar knight in London.
Temple Church.
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear Roger and I must discuss a change in flight plan.
Leigh.
Harbouring and transporting fugitives?
You are already implicated enough.
You and I, Robert, have observed history.
Time has been our glass.
We are in history now.
Living it.
Making it.
" Implicated"?
I am on a Grail quest.
Forgive me, Robert but you two may well have given this old man the greatest night of his life.
Thank you.
He's going to want more money.
I suppose this is a new technique for investigations.
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.
No extradition.
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch.
He called me.
What's going on, Bezu?
You know that I am Opus Dei?
Yes.
A bishop of my order called me.
He said a killer came to him in confession.
His name was Robert Langdon.
He said I couldn't imagine the evil in this man's heart.
That he would keep killing.
He said I had to stop him.
The bishop broke his vows to tell me this.
He charged me to stop Robert Langdon.
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?
The bishop?
God himself?
They've changed their flight plan to London.
I have them, tower.
Relay Hawker to land and hold on tarmac.
-Secure the area!
-Wider!
-Armed police!
-You two, round the back!
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!
-Three men up!
-Ready!
Put your hands in the air!
Do it now!
I'm afraid that's easier said than done in my case.
Oh, good morning.
Did that old cannabis charge finally catch up with me?
Sir, the French police say you're transporting fugitives and you may have a hostage onboard.
I'm to take you all into custody.
Sadly, I have an important medical appointment which I can't miss.
I'll fetch the car, sir.
This is serious, sir.
The French police are on their way.
Stop!
Inspector, I can't afford the time to indulge your games.
I'm late and I'm leaving.
If it's so important for you to stop us then you're just going to have to shoot us.
You can start with him.
Search the plane.
All right.
I could run them over.
Bad tip.
Let him go.
The French cannot be trusted.
Everyone comfy?
Biscuits?
They didn't notice anything?
Well, people rarely notice things right in front of their eyes, don't you find?
Do you have the bonds, bishop?
Yes, I do, Teacher.
I have chosen an Opus Dei residence for the exchange.
I am honoured.
By the time you get to London, I will have the Grail.
Remember, if we are discovered by the Vatican, we are excommunicated.
-So should anything go wrong--
-Yes, I know, I know.
This council does not exist.
As it never has.
Old friend.
Heaven protect you.
Keep an eye out for the police.
I must say, Robert, I'm quite impressed by the way you withstood my little aeroplane.
Did he never tell you?
When he was a boy, young Robert fell into a well.
How old were you?
Seven.
Treading water all night long, screaming his lungs out to the echoes screaming back.
When they found him, he was nearly catatonic.
Help!
It was a long time ago.
Oh, now, now, Robert.
You above all people shouldn't be one to dismiss the influence of the past.
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the Grail location secret all these years?
I don't know.
Some say the Priory wait for the heir to reveal himself which is especially odd since legend suggests he may not know his own true identity.
Hello?
Why do they make them so scary?
Oh, it's cold.
" In London lies a knight a Pope interred."
So which tomb has an orb?
Two wear tunics over their armour and two have full-length robes.
Two are grasping swords.
And one-
- Two are praying.
This one has his arms at his sides.
Oh, and this poor fellow has almost disappeared entirely.
I don't see any orb that ought be on a tomb.
"Ought be on his tomb." Are we looking for a missing orb?
Maybe.
Over here, see.
These aren't tombs.
-What?
Yes, of course they are.
-No.
-They're effigies.
-What?
Not tombs.
There's no bodies here.
This place is wrong.
Can we go now?
We should go.
Sophie!
No!
Where is the keystone?
Do not test me!
-Let her go!
-Don't hurt her.
Give me the keystone!
Give it to me!
Here!
Here!
Here it is!
Here it is.
Just let her go, and you and I can-- We'll come to some agreement.
Remy.
Remy.
No, no, no.
No, put it away.
Put it away.
They're too close together.
You don't have a clear shot.
-Yes, I do.
-What do you think you're doing?
Thank you, professor.
For a moment, this was getting complicated.
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!
That was satisfying.
I'm glad this bullshit is over.
Throw Teabing in the trunk.
What?
Here.
You okay?
Sorry.
I don't think he's following.
They won't kill Leigh until they find the Grail.
-So we have to find it before they do.
-I have to get to a library, fast.
He once whined to me about the wasted space of so large a trunk.
Let's see if he complains so now.
Are you the Teacher?
I am.
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.
You've done enough.
We cannot let ego deter us from our goal.
I understand.
Good.
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei, and you will be rewarded.
I will dispose of the old man.
Bless you, Silas.
Teacher.
Christ be with you.
We're at least a half-hour to Chelsea Library.
If we're gonna help Leigh, that's too long.
Where you going?
Getting you a library card.
Excuse me.
May I sit next to you?
-Yeah, sure.
-Thank you.
That's great.
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.
Thanks.
Let's see if we can access the database on this.
" In London lies a knight a Pope interred."
Compounding keywords:
Knight, Pope, Grail.
Your precious treasure was almost lost, and with it, my fortune.
Can you believe how well I did?
I even convinced the monk.
I should be in theatre.
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.
Your identity shall go with me to the grave.
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.
See, keywords keep coming up with the writings of some bloke named Alexander Pope.
"A. Pope."
Your grandfather was a genius.
Come on.
Emergency.
Which service do you require?
I know the location of two murderers wanted by French police.
We've just had a 999 call.
Triangulation leads back to Docklands.
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers are hiding at an Opus Dei house.
The knight we're looking for is Sir Isaac Newton.
His life's work produced new sciences that incurred the wrath of the Church.
Gravity, for God sakes.
And if you choose to believe he was also a Grand Master of the Priory as well.
But if he offended the Catholic Church the Pope would be the last person to preside over his funeral.
Well, that's where I got it wrong.
" In London lies a knight a Pope interred."
Sir Isaac Newton's funeral was presided over by his good friend, his colleague, Alexander Pope.
A. Pope.
His first initial.
How did I miss that?
Here.
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.
An orb.
Yes.
Which one?
It's not possible to tell if a particular orb is missing.
"An orb with Rosy flesh and seeded womb."
Solar system.
The planets.
Constellations.
Signs of the zodiac.
See, our moon is missing.
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?
Robert.
These tracks.
Look at the cane marks in the dust.
Teabing was here.
He was alone.
When the two of you arrived at my home as you did others might call it God's will.
I believed that if I had the cryptex I could solve the riddle alone.
But I was unworthy.
But you....
You have a reason to be here.
You're the last remaining guardian of the Grail.
Your grandfather and the other senechaux would not have lied with dying breath unless they knew their secret was preserved.
How could you know Sauniere's last words?
Leigh.
Grail quests require sacrifice.
You are a murderer.
No.
No.
Robert, tell her.
When history is written, murderers are heroes.
You self-righteous bastard!
We need to just walk away.
-No, don't.
Don't.
-Walk away.
I'll do what I have to now.
Anything.
Do you understand?
So now can't we all be friends again?
This way.
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.
I'm listening now.
For 2000 years the Church has rained oppression and atrocity upon mankind crushed passion and idea alik e, all in the name of their walking God.
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring an end to all that suffering drive this church of lies to its knees.
Armed police!
Drop your weapon!
Stop, Silas!
We are betrayed, my son.
The living heir must be revealed.
Jesus must be shown for what he was.
Not miraculous, simply man.
I'm sorry.
Armed police!
Drop your weapon!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Put it down now!
Put it down!
I am a ghost.
The dark con can be exposed.
Mankind can finally be set free, and we can do it, Robert.
The three of us.
How is Silas?
Is he--?
Is he alive?
The monk?
Bishop, how would you know this killer's name?
Get me out of here, Fache.
Wait.
Langdon never came to you in confession, did he?
One of your followers called you about the crime-scene photos.
I cannot be implicated here.
There are still important works to be done.
You used me.
God uses us all.
Help me, Fache.
Take him.
-Did you get his cell phone?
-Yes, sir.
I'm going to need a trace.
Your Silas is dead.
The Priory's sacred charge was to reveal the heir at the dawn of the new millennium.
The millennium came and went and the living heir remained hidden.
The Priory failed in their sacred charge.
So, what choice did I have?
I sought out the enemy.
I persuaded them, the Council of Shadows, that I was an ally.
I even asked them for money so they would never suspect me.
Rector, I made them call me.
"Teacher."
-Why don't you and l--
-No.
Robert, no words.
On your knees.
Do it.
No, I mean it.
Down.
Not you.
No, my dear, you....
You're my miracle, Sophie.
You're the guardian of the Grail.
All the oppression of the poor and the powerless of those of different skin, of women.
You can put an end to all that.
You must explode the truth onto the world.
It's your duty.
You know the answer to this riddle.
Open the cryptex and I'll put down the gun.
I have no idea how.
I don't know the code.
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
Like your grandfather, then.
Willing to die for your secret.
But by the way you've been looking at your hero I wonder, would you let him die for you?
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.
-Leigh, you can't just--
-Open the cryptex.
I don't know how.
Open it or he dies.
-I swear, I don't know.
-Do it!
Do it!
-Stop it!
-I don't know!
Stop it!
She can't do it, Leigh.
But give me a moment.
Robert.
What are you doing?
Please.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No!
No, Robert!
No!
No.
Oh, the map.
It's ruined.
The map is ruined.
The Grail.
It's lost.
The Grail is gone.
Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh.
You taught me that.
Armed police!
Drop it!
Drop your weapon!
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.
That one.
The old man.
You're under arrest!
You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned something which you later rely on in court.
Anything you do say will be given in evidence.
I'll have some questions for you.
Robert!
Robert!
Robert!
How could you do it?
How could you?
Robert!
To destroy our hope of freedom.
To deny every pilgrim the chance to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.
How could you?
You couldn't!
You solved it.
You took the scroll out before it broke!
You solved it.
Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it.
You know what to do.
You'll find the Grail, you'll kneel before her and you'll set her free upon the world!
That man there, he's got the map to the Holy Grail!
There was every orb conceivable on that tomb except one:
The orb which fell from the heavens and inspired Newton's life's work.
Work that incurred the wrath of the Church until his dying day.
A-P-P-L-E.
Apple.
The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits
The blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates
Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies
She rests at last beneath the starry skies
I think I know where she's gone.
I think the Grail has gone home.
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.
Rosslyn Chapel.
So this is it.
The gift at the end.
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits."
You never told me the joke Sauniere made of you.
What was it?
He called me a flatfoot.
A beat cop of history.
Oh, a dumb policeman who just does his job day after day, of history.
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.
Sauniere said he was the most honourable man he had ever known.
We are who we protect, I think.
What we stand up for.
Jewish Christian, Egyptian Masonic, pagan Templar crosses pyramids.
I think I've been here before.
Sophie.
A very long time ago.
Come along, Sophie.
Sophie.
Over here.
"The blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates."
Pagan symbols for male and female.
Fused as one.
As the pagans would have wanted.
We're about to close, I'm afraid.
We're just gonna be a moment.
Robert.
"Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies."
"She rests at last beneath the starry skies."
The fleur-de-lis.
She was here.
Her sarcophagus.
Mary Magdalene.
The Holy Grail herself.
She was here.
Where did she go?
Did the Church finally get her?
This is incredible.
Look at this.
Look at this.
These records go back thousands of years.
They date back to the death of Christ.
Good God, could these really be the Grail documents?
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?
How was I ever supposed to figure all this out?
When you and your grandfather fought was it something about your past?
How could you know that?
About how your parents died?
Sophie?
It was during primary school.
I was in his library.
Doing research.
I was trying to find out about my family.
Sophie, where are you, princess?
I wanted to know about them.
But I couldn't find any records.
Not of their death not of the accident.
I'd ask ed him for as long as I could remember but he would never tell me.
I told you, no.
But why can't I?
He stood over me and he wouldn't let me leave.
They're dead.
Dead and buried.
Never look for them, Sophie.
Promise me.
Swear it!
Swear it to me!
I kept my promise.
The next week he sent me to boarding school.
One week end I came home unexpectedly.
And what I saw my grandfather doing....
Some ritual.
I was so frightened.
We hardly ever spoke again.
Do you have any memories of your grandfather before the accident?
Before your parents were killed?
Yeah.
No.
I don't know.
Why?
Because I don't think he was your grandfather.
These are my parents.
My brother.
And this is you, isn't it?
The paper says the entire family was killed.
The mother, the father, the boy, 6 and the girl, 4.
But your name was never Sauniere.
It's Saint-Clair.
It's one of the oldest families in France.
It's from a line of the Merovingian kings.
Royal blood.
I was so wrong.
Sauniere didn't want you to help guard the secret of the Holy Grail.
Sophie you are the secret.
You survived the accident.
If it even was an accident.
The Priory found out.
Somehow they concealed the fact that you were alive.
They hid you with the Grand Master himself who raised you as his own.
According to all of this Princess Sophie you are the heir.
The end of the bloodline.
You are the last living descendent of Jesus Christ.
What is this?
Sophie?
Who are you?
There have been many names.
The keepers.
Guardians.
The Priory of Sion.
But to you, Sophie, we are friends of the man who raised you:
Jacques Sauniere.
He would have wanted you to know that he loved you very much.
And that the Priory are here to protect you now as they have always protected our family.
I gave you up once knowing I might never see you again.
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.
I have prayed for this moment for a very long time.
Welcome home, child.
Hey.
She has some things she wants to tell me.
About my family.
What will you do?
The legend will be revealed when the heir reveals himself.
They just got the pronoun wrong.
She said when Sauniere died he took the location of Mary's sarcophagus with him.
So there's no way to empirically prove that I am related to her.
What would you do, Robert?
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.
But, Sophie, the only thing that matters is what you believe.
History shows us Jesus was an extraordinary man a human inspiration.
That's it.
That's all the evidence has ever proved.
But when I was a boy....
When I was down in that well Teabing told you about I thought I was going to die, Sophie.
What I did I prayed.
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive so I could see my parents again so I could go to school again so I could play with my dog.
Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't alone down there.
Why does it have to be human or divine?
Maybe human is divine.
Why couldn't Jesus have been a father and still been capable of all those miracles?
Like turning water into wine?
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.
Maybe that junkie in the park will never touch a drug again.
Maybe you healed my phobia with your hands.
And maybe you're a knight on a Grail quest.
Well, here's the question:
A living descendent of Jesus Christ would she destroy faith?
Or would she renew it?
So again I say, what matters is what you believe.
Thank you.
For bringing me here.
For letting him choose you Sir Robert.
You take care.
Yes.
Hey.
Nope.
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.
Godspeed.
Bloodline.
Rose Line.
" Hides beneath the Rose."
"The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits.
Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies.
The blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates.
She rests at last beneath starry skies. "
So, have you finished?
Yes, that's it.
Any other plans?
I've got an address.
I'll go see tomorrow.
Where are you going?
To work.
It's not too early?
Recently, I've had to be there early.
So, it's finished?
Yes, that's it.
That's good.
- How much?
- Count!
Jean-Fran?
is!
What are you doing there?
Come into the house.
Hear me, Jean-Fran?
is?
Where are you going, you pig?
Help me!
Who do you think you are, you animal?
Wake up, asshole!
Wake up, you shit!
Wake up!
- What's wrong?
- He's just a pig.
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, he'll be alright soon.
We'll lift him up.
We have to make him run.
Come on.
No, that way.
If we don't bring him round, he's had it.
I think I passed out.
Come on, let's walk a bit.
- Who are you?
- Me?
He's working on the house.
You hired him.
There.
How old are you?
22.
That's really something.
Some people are 25 or 30... but to be 22... that's amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
I need to know what to expect.
I'll have lots of money soon.
Who'd give money to such an idiot?
I've already been paid.
Remember?
I never understood that.
- You never understood?
- Never.
And you never will.
Don't worry your head about it.
Did he give you the advance?
He promised me it in 3 days.
I can help you this weekend if you want.
That'd be great.
The roof beams need changing.
I'm off. I'm working tonight.
Leaving already?
Yeah.
Do you want a coffee?
- Want a coffee?
- No, thanks.
What's it about?
Dope?
Nothing like that.
That workman up there... needs his advance, but after that, I don't know how I'll pay him.
Don't you need someone?
No, and it's not my decision.
If it's to make someone pay up, that's my thing.
It's not. I can't tell you any more.
I'm not sure I'll make it.
Put in a word for me.
Want to take my place?
I'm not sure they'll need me.
I'm stone-broke. I'm on the street.
If it works, I'll help you out.
How long will it take?
A day.
You'll earn that much in a day?
I doubt I'll get through it.
- lt worked last time.
- That was last time.
When do you go?
I don't know.
Last month, they said they'd summon me, but I haven't heard.
What did he want?
Money.
His business isn't going too well.
I don't think there's anything left.
Pity.
He paid for your lawyer when you were in jail.
I haven't forgotten.
- Know what your sister said?
- Don't start.
You belong in prison, nowhere else.
My sister always speaks the truth.
Always...
- How's it going?
- OK.
How long now?
10 days.
And the other side?
It'll all be finished in 10 days.
Good.
Hello. I think he's had it.
A striped envelope.
No, I couldn't get it back.
I'll send you the photos.
Shit!
Hey, mister!
Where are you?
- What is it?
- Can you help me?
Quick!
What's wrong?
We must break the door down.
He's passed out.
There's an ax on the terrace.
Jean-Fran?
is!
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
He's dead.
- Aren't you tired?
- A bit.
How's things, Dad?
Fine.
- Hello, madam.
- Hello.
Come in.
Go on.
Thank you for yesterday.
That's OK. I'm sorry for you.
Don't be.
With the quantities he'd been taking, it was inevitable.
I hope you'll continue the work.
No.
His sister will inherit the house, so it's not my problem now.
Oh?
Look, I'm really sorry.
Who's going to pay me now?
I doubt his sister will ever come.
She'll get an agency to sell the house.
I never encouraged him to take that shit.
He doesn't need it anymore.
When are you leaving?
After the funeral.
He was waiting on a job.
Do you know about it?
Maybe the letter will come before you leave.
It came yesterday.
You've got it?
Can I see it?
There's nothing to see.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
What'll you do with it?
Get the ticket refunded.
I'll buy it off you.
OK, you can have it.
If it works, I won't forget you.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
Where was the ticket for?
Paris.
The name of the hotel?
That I do remember:
Windsor.
What did Pierre Bl?
ot intend to do with it?
To replace Jean-Fran?
is.
What does he know?
He just knew there was a lot of money at stake.
When did they discuss it?
Yesterday morning.
Did anyone go in other than the police and doctors?
No...
Yes, the workman.
I asked him to smash the door to the bathroom.
When did Mr Godon intend to leave?
Today.
Thank you very much.
Where were you during their talk?
- ln the corridor.
- You heard their words?
Of course.
Sorry, my brother over there has got it.
He'll show it to you.
Come with me, sir.
If you want the ticket, go see my brother over there.
But you have to be present.
Want me to throw you out, asshole?
You're crazy!
What is it, Ludo?
He wants the ticket, but won't move his fat ass.
Come on, I'll show you his ticket.
- Hello?
- Mr Godon?
Yeah.
Got a pen and paper?
Just a second.
By noon tomorrow, go to Gare du Nord.
Locker 103.
You'll find a train ticket with instructions.
The code is 402 # 4.
Get out one stop before the station on the ticket.
Don't forget: one stop before.
Jesus...
Good day, sir.
Your ticket, please.
Thank you.
Pleasant journey.
His stop's Valen?
y.
- What time?
- 5:08.
I'll see to it.
I need 2 unmarked cars, Valen?
y Station, 5:08.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Where to?
- Know where that is?
- Yes.
- ls it far?
- lt's a fair way.
The number's 375 MHJ 45.
Get out.
Go over there.
- Undress.
- Why?
Gotta search you.
And the rest.
What the hell are you doing?
Get dressed.
I stopped there.
As I did a U-turn, he went to the sign.
Didn't it seem strange that he stopped here?
People can stop where they like.
You didn't notice anything else?
Nothing in particular.
Go sit down.
- You're here?
- Yeah, guess so.
- Found a player?
- Yeah.
- Don't like him?
- l do.
Each to his own!
Who's that?
I can explain.
Shut up!
Call Jos?
Go get Jos?
Hello, Alain.
This the boy who's playing?
Yes, it's him.
Good...
Brave...
There's only 13 of us.
Not many.
In Istanbul, there were 42 of us.
The opening bet was 500,000.
How much is it here?
If it's under 100,000, there's no point.
At least, otherwise it's not worth it.
Have you been around the place?
It's not very big.
Well, I'll wait downstairs.
Who's he?
What do you mean?
The guy from the crossroads.
- He had the card.
- l wasn't expecting him.
Jean-Fran?
is is dead.
What're you talking about?
He took an overdose.
Let me see your papers.
Did he tell you about this?
I knew he was waiting for a letter.
He hoped to earn a lot.
I found it and followed the instructions.
Do you know what it's about?
No idea.
Maybe the cops sent him.
Who would agree to do that?
Maybe they didn't tell him.
That'd mean the cops are watching us and will show up.
So, it's now or never to get out.
If the cops show up and we've gone, they'll think I ratted.
I'd rather be arrested.
- ls your man here?
- Yes, no problem.
- We're about to start.
- Coming.
If I don't suit you, I can leave.
You can't leave now.
What if it doesn't suit me?
You gotta play now.
- How much are you betting?
- Dunno.
What do you think?
Dunno.
Don't ask me.
I'm gonna bet the minimum.
My cylinder doesn't work.
What's going on?
- His gun won't work.
- So, change it!
Supervisors, hand out one bullet to each player.
I should get my share now.
You've gotta see it through.
Man is only born once and only dies once.
Get ready!
Nothing else happens.
- Be philosophical.
- Round 1's starting.
You're a descendant of Schopenhauer.
Mr Schl?
dorff, go the other side, please.
OK, I'm going.
Be philosophical about it.
Get ready!
Round 1 is about to start.
Excuse me.
Blow up a head for me.
The audience must step back.
Step back... back...
This'll bring you luck.
More...
Thank you.
Load your cylinder!
Number 13, got a problem?
Problem with your gun?
Got a problem?
Nobody get in the ring.
- Get out.
- He can't load it.
Give it here.
This is to open the cylinder, OK?
OK, that's enough.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer.
Number 13, don't turn your head.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Everyone stare at the bulb.
Wait!
Wait!
Number 13 didn't shoot.
Shoot!
Why won't you shoot?
Shoot!
Mr Alain, what's got into your player?
If he doesn't, we'll shoot him, and you'll get fined!
I'll count to three.
One...
Go on, shoot!
Two...
Hey, get out of the ring.
You finished your scene, you shit?
Shit to you, too!
Don't start that crap again.
Why didn't you shoot?
Why didn't you?
You gotta shoot, dammit!
Want some morphine?
No, I don't.
Morphine's fuckin' cool.
They all take it.
Who's not had his dose?
- Us.
- Come on, then.
I bet 500,000 on Number 13.
Get lost!
I want to bet on you.
Beat it, you little shit!
I've lost my player.
Can I bet on yours?
I want 50% of your cut.
Alright.
Just for this round.
OK.
Put your name down on Number 13.
350 on Number 13.
350 on Number 10.
C'mon, get him up here.
It's OK, he's here.
What are you playing at?
You can't get out of here.
Put your bullets in the cylinder.
2 bullets!
Raise your gun!
Spin your cylinder!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
Don't look me in the eyes.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Shit!
He didn't have time.
The bullet's in the barrel.
Hans!
Come here, Hans.
Go get him.
350 on Number 7.
I lost my player.
I know, it's written here.
Shit happens.
No one will let me bet on another player.
Why not?
I don't know, I'm bad luck.
What can I do about it?
Don't you run this organization?
What's that change?
I'm here to gamble the 2 million in this case.
It's in your interest.
We don't force anyone into the shit.
You've already killed two.
That's great.
You can make big money.
When you start, you finish.
What's it to you?
1 .5 million on Number 6.
Very well.
I did well to bet on your player.
You staying with us?
No.
With the 2 brothers.
I've gambled the lot.
If I lose, you'll have to go home alone.
Cut the crap.
Weird...
They're brothers.
God, I hate that number!
Forget it, it's nothing.
I said, forget it.
If he kills a third, you get a bonus.
That'd be wonderful.
Gentlemen!
Third round.
Let's go.
Now!
Get up!
Number 8...
Number 3...
Number 1 1 ...
Number 1 1 !
Mr Schl?
dorff, your player must get in the ring.
Just a second.
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
A touch of diarrhea.
Get him up there.
I'm gonna get you.
What a fucker!
What's he playing at?
He better calm down.
Supervisors, hand out the bullets now.
3 bullets per player.
Hand out 3 bullets!
Excuse me, Mr Schmitt.
Can our player have a chair?
He's in pain.
Mr Andr?
s asking, too.
You shouldn't be here.
Go back to the other side.
Give him a chair.
The gamblers must step back.
Sir!
Step back!
What's wrong with him?
He's drugged up.
Take him up to his room.
Quick!
Put the bullets in the cylinder!
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Oh, fuckin' hell!
Come.
Come here.
Gentlemen!
We've reached the final leg of our game.
The duel.
3 bullets in the cylinder.
Here are 4 balls.
2 are white.
2 are colored.
The 2 colored balls indicate the duelists.
I call on Numbers 1 , 3, 6, and 13.
So everyone can see, I want you to open them above your heads.
I want no ambiguity.
Gentlemen, good luck.
Numbers 6 and 13.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
I want to bet on your player.
- He's got no experience.
- Precisely.
I'm always luckier when I go against logic.
80% .
- That's a lot.
- You won't get less.
Well, I'll bet then.
I should get my share now.
The bets are low.
We won't make much.
I know you.
I fell... because of you.
What do you mean?
I've been thinking.
I want my share.
Go over to the wall.
You go over to your wall.
It's a piece of shit.
They're all the same.
Gentlemen, please.
One...
Two...
Three...
Very good.
OK with me.
Gentlemen, please be silent.
Silence, please.
Thank you.
I want the players to step forward.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
Stop!
Take aim!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Get ready!
The duel continues with 4 bullets in the cylinder.
One more bullet in the cylinder.
Supervisors, hand each player an extra bullet.
One, two, three, four bullets.
Players, step forward.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
Stop!
Take aim!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
It's over, gentlemen.
Finished.
All over, gentlemen.
Calm down. lt's over, finished.
The winner is Number 13.
Bravo!
Number 13, bravo!
Here's the winner.
Congratulations.
Go get your money.
Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- 850.
Thanks to you, I've won back all I'd lost.
It was far from certain.
I'm not very lucky at the moment.
9... 10...
Give them a wad.
You're lucky, you know.
Your opponent already won 3 duels.
What about me?
Not giving me anything?
Got your money?
Yeah.
Are you pleased?
Want a lift?
Where to?
We'll leave you at the nearest station.
I'll get dressed and wait outside.
- Want a drink?
- No.
Where are you going?
- l'll go with him.
- Go up and get the coats.
- See Number 13?
- He took his stuff.
- Where is he?
- Open the trunk.
It was lucky he came.
What'd we have done?
Off you go.
10 euros, please.
Your receipt.
Goodbye.
Oh, it's you?
Yes, listen.
I sent you a parcel with money in it.
What money?
A lot of money.
Who gave it to you?
What is all this?
I'll tell you when I get back.
When will you be back?
No doubt tomorrow.
Why send it?
You could've brought it.
Something might happen before then.
It was safer that way.
When you get the receipt, go get the parcel.
What's going on?
Where are you?
Don't worry for now.
Everything's fine.
"For now"?
Where are you?
I'm calling just in case.
See you soon.
In case of what?
Everything's fine.
Take care.
Pleasant journey.
Bye.
- He's over there.
- OK, thanks.
Police!
Please stand up.
Raise your arms, please.
Please come with us.
Thanks.
What did you do with the money?
What money?
You're lucky you came back from there.
I don't know what you mean.
Sit down.
Sit!
I know where you were.
You stole the envelope from Godon's and you went in his place.
I'm not wrong, am I?
No, that's what happened.
Tell me in detail what happened there.
Where?
You know very well.
You went for the money.
I didn't make it. I didn't get there.
Don't bullshit me.
You'll regret it.
I'm telling you the truth.
What car were they in at the crossroads?
A black Peugeot.
What did you say to the driver?
Nothing.
He refused to talk.
He said his job was to get me there.
Where did he drop you?
Somewhere in the forest.
What could you see there?
Other guys waiting for us.
Near a car.
What did you talk about?
I told them Mr Godon was dead.
I offered to take his place, but they refused.
It didn't work out.
They must've decided I wasn't suitable.
You're lying.
You must've convinced them.
Otherwise you'd be dead now.
Who says they were going to let me live?
I ran away.
Once we'd talked, I saw one guy pull out his gun, and I ran for it.
Didn't they shoot?
Yes, they ran after me, shooting at me, but I got away.
I ran so much, I broke my heels.
Look.
Could you identify them?
Yes, of course.
Could you take me to the place in the forest?
I panicked and ran in the dark.
How could I remember?
You could, in a car from the crossroads.
No.
As I got in, the driver put a blindfold on me.
You're lying.
When I look at you, I smell the stink of blood.
I've told you everything.
You've told me nothing.
I had a plan. lf you'd got out at the right station, I'd have arrested the henchmen and made them talk.
Now I've lost my only lead.
What's this all about?
It's a dirty business.
A dirty business of murder.
There was another car in the forest.
I remember the number.
Tell me.
GR 13 13.
What make of car was it?
A blue Peugeot 607.
But that's all I know, believe me.
10 euros, please.
Thanks.
Bye.

- Paris
So, have you finished?
Yes, that's it.
Any other plans?
I've got an address.
I'll go see tomorrow.
Where are you going?
To work.
It's not too early?
Recently, I've had to be there early.
So, it's finished?
Yes, that's it.
That's good.
- How much?
- Count!
Jean-François!
What are you doing there?
Come into the house.
Hear me, Jean-François?
Where are you going, you pig?
Help me!
Who do you think you are, you animal?
Wake up, asshole!
Wake up, you shit!
Wake up!
- What's wrong?
- He's just a pig.
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, he'll be alright soon.
We'll lift him up.
We have to make him run.
Come on.
No, that way.
If we don't bring him round, he's had it.
I think I passed out.
Come on, let's walk a bit.
- Who are you?
- Me?
He's working on the house.
You hired him.
There.
How old are you?
22.
That's really something.
Some people are 25 or 30... but to be 22... that's amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
I need to know what to expect.
I'll have lots of money soon.
Who'd give money to such an idiot?
I've already been paid.
Remember?
I never understood that.
- You never understood?
- Never.
And you never will.
Don't worry your head about it.
Did he give you the advance?
He promised me it in 3 days.
I can help you this weekend if you want.
That'd be great.
The roof beams need changing.
I'm off. I'm working tonight.
Leaving already?
Yeah.
Do you want a coffee?
- Want a coffee?
- No, thanks.
What's it about?
Dope?
Nothing like that.
That workman up there... needs his advance, but after that, I don't know how I'll pay him.
Don't you need someone?
No, and it's not my decision.
If it's to make someone pay up, that's my thing.
It's not. I can't tell you any more.
I'm not sure I'll make it.
Put in a word for me.
Want to take my place?
I'm not sure they'll need me.
I'm stone-broke. I'm on the street.
If it works, I'll help you out.
How long will it take?
A day.
You'll earn that much in a day?
I doubt I'll get through it.
- lt worked last time.
- That was last time.
When do you go?
I don't know.
Last month, they said they'd summon me, but I haven't heard.
What did he want?
Money.
His business isn't going too well.
I don't think there's anything left.
Pity.
He paid for your lawyer when you were in jail.
I haven't forgotten.
- Know what your sister said?
- Don't start.
You belong in prison, nowhere else.
My sister always speaks the truth.
Always...
- How's it going?
- OK.
How long now?
10 days.
And the other side?
It'll all be finished in 10 days.
Good.
Hello. I think he's had it.
A striped envelope.
No, I couldn't get it back.
I'll send you the photos.
Shit!
Hey, mister!
Where are you?
- What is it?
- Can you help me?
Quick!
What's wrong?
We must break the door down.
He's passed out.
There's an ax on the terrace.
Jean-François!
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
He's dead.
- Aren't you tired?
- A bit.
How's things, Dad?
Fine.
- Hello, madam.
- Hello.
Come in.
Go on.
Thank you for yesterday.
That's OK. I'm sorry for you.
Don't be.
With the quantities he'd been taking, it was inevitable.
I hope you'll continue the work.
No.
His sister will inherit the house, so it's not my problem now.
Oh?
Look, I'm really sorry.
Who's going to pay me now?
I doubt his sister will ever come.
She'll get an agency to sell the house.
I never encouraged him to take that shit.
He doesn't need it anymore.
When are you leaving?
After the funeral.
He was waiting on a job.
Do you know about it?
Maybe the letter will come before you leave.
It came yesterday.
You've got it?
Can I see it?
There's nothing to see.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
What'll you do with it?
Get the ticket refunded.
I'll buy it off you.
OK, you can have it.
If it works, I won't forget you.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
Where was the ticket for?
Paris.
The name of the hotel?
That I do remember:
Windsor.
What did Pierre Blérot intend to do with it?
To replace Jean-François.
What does he know?
He just knew there was a lot of money at stake.
When did they discuss it?
Yesterday morning.
Did anyone go in other than the police and doctors?
No...
Yes, the workman.
I asked him to smash the door to the bathroom.
When did Mr Godon intend to leave?
Today.
Thank you very much.
Where were you during their talk?
- ln the corridor.
- You heard their words?
Of course.
Sorry, my brother over there has got it.
He'll show it to you.
Come with me, sir.
If you want the ticket, go see my brother over there.
But you have to be present.
Want me to throw you out, asshole?
You're crazy!
What is it, Ludo?
He wants the ticket, but won't move his fat ass.
Come on, I'll show you his ticket.
- Hello?
- Mr Godon?
Yeah.
Got a pen and paper?
Just a second.
By noon tomorrow, go to Gare du Nord.
Locker 103.
You'll find a train ticket with instructions.
The code is 402 # 4.
Get out one stop before the station on the ticket.
Don't forget: one stop before.
Jesus...
Good day, sir.
Your ticket, please.
Thank you.
Pleasant journey.
His stop's Valençay.
- What time?
- 5:08.
I'll see to it.
I need 2 unmarked cars, Valençay Station, 5:08.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Where to?
- Know where that is?
- Yes.
- ls it far?
- lt's a fair way.
The number's 375 MHJ 45.
Get out.
Go over there.
- Undress.
- Why?
Gotta search you.
And the rest.
What the hell are you doing?
Get dressed.
I stopped there.
As I did a U-turn, he went to the sign.
Didn't it seem strange that he stopped here?
People can stop where they like.
You didn't notice anything else?
Nothing in particular.
Go sit down.
- You're here?
- Yeah, guess so.
- Found a player?
- Yeah.
- Don't like him?
- l do.
Each to his own!
Who's that?
I can explain.
Shut up!
Call José.
Go get José.
Hello, Alain.
This the boy who's playing?
Yes, it's him.
Good...
Brave...
There's only 13 of us.
Not many.
In Istanbul, there were 42 of us.
The opening bet was 500,000.
How much is it here?
If it's under 100,000, there's no point.
At least, otherwise it's not worth it.
Have you been around the place?
It's not very big.
Well, I'll wait downstairs.
Who's he?
What do you mean?
The guy from the crossroads.
- He had the card.
- l wasn't expecting him.
Jean-François is dead.
What're you talking about?
He took an overdose.
Let me see your papers.
Did he tell you about this?
I knew he was waiting for a letter.
He hoped to earn a lot.
I found it and followed the instructions.
Do you know what it's about?
No idea.
Maybe the cops sent him.
Who would agree to do that?
Maybe they didn't tell him.
That'd mean the cops are watching us and will show up.
So, it's now or never to get out.
If the cops show up and we've gone, they'll think I ratted.
I'd rather be arrested.
- ls your man here?
- Yes, no problem.
- We're about to start.
- Coming.
If I don't suit you, I can leave.
You can't leave now.
What if it doesn't suit me?
You gotta play now.
- How much are you betting?
- Dunno.
What do you think?
Dunno.
Don't ask me.
I'm gonna bet the minimum.
My cylinder doesn't work.
What's going on?
- His gun won't work.
- So, change it!
Supervisors, hand out one bullet to each player.
I should get my share now.
You've gotta see it through.
Man is only born once and only dies once.
Get ready!
Nothing else happens.
- Be philosophical.
- Round 1's starting.
You're a descendant of Schopenhauer.
Mr Schlöndorff, go the other side, please.
OK, I'm going.
Be philosophical about it.
Get ready!
Round 1 is about to start.
Excuse me.
Blow up a head for me.
The audience must step back.
Step back... back...
This'll bring you luck.
More...
Thank you.
Load your cylinder!
Number 13, got a problem?
Problem with your gun?
Got a problem?
Nobody get in the ring.
- Get out.
- He can't load it.
Give it here.
This is to open the cylinder, OK?
OK, that's enough.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer.
Number 13, don't turn your head.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Everyone stare at the bulb.
Wait!
Wait!
Number 13 didn't shoot.
Shoot!
Why won't you shoot?
Shoot!
Mr Alain, what's got into your player?
If he doesn't, we'll shoot him, and you'll get fined!
I'll count to three.
One...
Go on, shoot!
Two...
Hey, get out of the ring.
You finished your scene, you shit?
Shit to you, too!
Don't start that crap again.
Why didn't you shoot?
Why didn't you?
You gotta shoot, dammit!
Want some morphine?
No, I don't.
Morphine's fuckin' cool.
They all take it.
Who's not had his dose?
- Us.
- Come on, then.
I bet 500,000 on Number 13.
Get lost!
I want to bet on you.
Beat it, you little shit!
I've lost my player.
Can I bet on yours?
I want 50% of your cut.
Alright.
Just for this round.
OK.
Put your name down on Number 13.
350 on Number 13.
350 on Number 10.
C'mon, get him up here.
It's OK, he's here.
What are you playing at?
You can't get out of here.
Put your bullets in the cylinder.
2 bullets!
Raise your gun!
Spin your cylinder!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
Don't look me in the eyes.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Shit!
He didn't have time.
The bullet's in the barrel.
Hans!
Come here, Hans.
Go get him.
350 on Number 7.
I lost my player.
I know, it's written here.
Shit happens.
No one will let me bet on another player.
Why not?
I don't know, I'm bad luck.
What can I do about it?
Don't you run this organization?
What's that change?
I'm here to gamble the 2 million in this case.
It's in your interest.
We don't force anyone into the shit.
You've already killed two.
That's great.
You can make big money.
When you start, you finish.
What's it to you?
1 .5 million on Number 6.
Very well.
I did well to bet on your player.
You staying with us?
No.
With the 2 brothers.
I've gambled the lot.
If I lose, you'll have to go home alone.
Cut the crap.
Weird...
They're brothers.
God, I hate that number!
Forget it, it's nothing.
I said, forget it.
If he kills a third, you get a bonus.
That'd be wonderful.
Gentlemen!
Third round.
Let's go.
Now!
Get up!
Number 8...
Number 3...
Number 1 1 ...
Number 1 1 !
Mr Schlöndorff, your player must get in the ring.
Just a second.
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
A touch of diarrhea.
Get him up there.
I'm gonna get you.
What a fucker!
What's he playing at?
He better calm down.
Supervisors, hand out the bullets now.
3 bullets per player.
Hand out 3 bullets!
Excuse me, Mr Schmitt.
Can our player have a chair?
He's in pain.
Mr André's asking, too.
You shouldn't be here.
Go back to the other side.
Give him a chair.
The gamblers must step back.
Sir!
Step back!
What's wrong with him?
He's drugged up.
Take him up to his room.
Quick!
Put the bullets in the cylinder!
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Oh, fuckin' hell!
Come.
Come here.
Gentlemen!
We've reached the final leg of our game.
The duel.
3 bullets in the cylinder.
Here are 4 balls.
2 are white.
2 are colored.
The 2 colored balls indicate the duelists.
I call on Numbers 1 , 3, 6, and 13.
So everyone can see, I want you to open them above your heads.
I want no ambiguity.
Gentlemen, good luck.
Numbers 6 and 13.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
I want to bet on your player.
- He's got no experience.
- Precisely.
I'm always luckier when I go against logic.
80% .
- That's a lot.
- You won't get less.
Well, I'll bet then.
I should get my share now.
The bets are low.
We won't make much.
I know you.
I fell... because of you.
What do you mean?
I've been thinking.
I want my share.
Go over to the wall.
You go over to your wall.
It's a piece of shit.
They're all the same.
Gentlemen, please.
One...
Two...
Three...
Very good.
OK with me.
Gentlemen, please be silent.
Silence, please.
Thank you.
I want the players to step forward.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
Stop!
Take aim!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Get ready!
The duel continues with 4 bullets in the cylinder.
One more bullet in the cylinder.
Supervisors, hand each player an extra bullet.
One, two, three, four bullets.
Players, step forward.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
Stop!
Take aim!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
It's over, gentlemen.
Finished.
All over, gentlemen.
Calm down. lt's over, finished.
The winner is Number 13.
Bravo!
Number 13, bravo!
Here's the winner.
Congratulations.
Go get your money.
Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- 850.
Thanks to you, I've won back all I'd lost.
It was far from certain.
I'm not very lucky at the moment.
9... 10...
Give them a wad.
You're lucky, you know.
Your opponent already won 3 duels.
What about me?
Not giving me anything?
Got your money?
Yeah.
Are you pleased?
Want a lift?
Where to?
We'll leave you at the nearest station.
I'll get dressed and wait outside.
- Want a drink?
- No.
Where are you going?
- l'll go with him.
- Go up and get the coats.
- See Number 13?
- He took his stuff.
- Where is he?
- Open the trunk.
It was lucky he came.
What'd we have done?
Off you go.
10 euros, please.
Your receipt.
Goodbye.
Oh, it's you?
Yes, listen.
I sent you a parcel with money in it.
What money?
A lot of money.
Who gave it to you?
What is all this?
I'll tell you when I get back.
When will you be back?
No doubt tomorrow.
Why send it?
You could've brought it.
Something might happen before then.
It was safer that way.
When you get the receipt, go get the parcel.
What's going on?
Where are you?
Don't worry for now.
Everything's fine.
"For now"?
Where are you?
I'm calling just in case.
See you soon.
In case of what?
Everything's fine.
Take care.
Pleasant journey.
Bye.
- He's over there.
- OK, thanks.
Police!
Please stand up.
Raise your arms, please.
Please come with us.
Thanks.
What did you do with the money?
What money?
You're lucky you came back from there.
I don't know what you mean.
Sit down.
Sit!
I know where you were.
You stole the envelope from Godon's and you went in his place.
I'm not wrong, am I?
No, that's what happened.
Tell me in detail what happened there.
Where?
You know very well.
You went for the money.
I didn't make it. I didn't get there.
Don't bullshit me.
You'll regret it.
I'm telling you the truth.
What car were they in at the crossroads?
A black Peugeot.
What did you say to the driver?
Nothing.
He refused to talk.
He said his job was to get me there.
Where did he drop you?
Somewhere in the forest.
What could you see there?
Other guys waiting for us.
Near a car.
What did you talk about?
I told them Mr Godon was dead.
I offered to take his place, but they refused.
It didn't work out.
They must've decided I wasn't suitable.
You're lying.
You must've convinced them.
Otherwise you'd be dead now.
Who says they were going to let me live?
I ran away.
Once we'd talked, I saw one guy pull out his gun, and I ran for it.
Didn't they shoot?
Yes, they ran after me, shooting at me, but I got away.
I ran so much, I broke my heels.
Look.
Could you identify them?
Yes, of course.
Could you take me to the place in the forest?
I panicked and ran in the dark.
How could I remember?
You could, in a car from the crossroads.
No.
As I got in, the driver put a blindfold on me.
You're lying.
When I look at you, I smell the stink of blood.
I've told you everything.
You've told me nothing.
I had a plan. lf you'd got out at the right station, I'd have arrested the henchmen and made them talk.
Now I've lost my only lead.
What's this all about?
It's a dirty business.
A dirty business of murder.
There was another car in the forest.
I remember the number.
Tell me.
GR 13 13.
What make of car was it?
A blue Peugeot 607.
But that's all I know, believe me.
10 euros, please.
Thanks.

Yes, it's him.
Good...
Brave...
There's only 13 of us.
Not many.
In Istanbul, there were 42 of us.
The opening bet was 500,000.
How much is it here?
If it's under 100,000, there's no point.
At least, otherwise it's not worth it.
Have you been around the place?
It's not very big.
Well, I'll wait downstairs.
Who's he?
What do you mean?
The guy from the crossroads.
- He had the card.
- I wasn't expecting him.
Jean-François is dead.
What're you talking about?
He took an overdose.
Let me see your papers.
Did he tell you about this?
I knew he was waiting for a letter.
He hoped to earn a lot.
I found it and followed the instructions.
Do you know what it's about?
No idea.
Maybe the cops sent him.
Who would agree to do that?
Maybe they didn't tell him.
That'd mean the cops are watching us and will show up.
So, it's now or never to get out.
If the cops show up and we've gone, they'll think I ratted.
I'd rather be arrested.
- Is your man here?
- Yes, no problem.
- We're about to start.
- Coming.
If I don't suit you, I can leave.
You can't leave now.
What if it doesn't suit me?
You gotta play now.
- How much are you betting?
- Dunno.
What do you think?
Dunno.
Don't ask me.
I'm gonna bet the minimum.
My cylinder doesn't work.
What's going on?
- His gun won't work.
- So, change it!
Supervisors, hand out one bullet to each player.
I should get my share now.
You've gotta see it through.
Man is only born once and only dies once.
Get ready!
Nothing else happens.
- Be philosophical.
- Round 1's starting.
You're a descendant of Schopenhauer.
Mr. Schlondorff, go the other side, please.
OK, I'm going.
Be philosophical about it.
Get ready!
Round 1 is about to start.
Excuse me.
Blow up a head for me.
The audience must step back.
Step back... back...
This'll bring you luck.
More...
Thank you.
Load your cylinder!
Number 13, got a problem?
Problem with your gun?
Got a problem?
Nobody get in the ring.
- Get out.
- He can't load it.
Give it here.
This is to open the cylinder, OK?
OK, that's enough.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer.
Number 13, don't turn your head.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Everyone stare at the bulb.
Wait!
Wait!
Number 13 didn't shoot.
Shoot!
Why won't you shoot?
Shoot!
Mr. Alain, what's got into your player?
If he doesn't, we'll shoot him, and you'll get fined!
I'll count to three.
One...
Go on, shoot!
Two...
Hey, get out of the ring.
You finished your scene, you shit?
Shit to you, too!
Don't start that crap again.
Why didn't you shoot?
Why didn't you?
You gotta shoot, dammit!
Want some morphine?
No, I don't.
Morphine's fuckin' cool.
They all take it.
Who's not had his dose?
- Us.
- Come on, then.
I bet 500,000 on Number 13.
Get lost!
I want to bet on you.
Beat it, you little shit!
I've lost my player.
Can I bet on yours?
I want 50% of your cut.
Alright.
Just for this round.
OK.
Put your name down on Number 13.
350 on Number 13.
350 on Number 10.
C'mon, get him up here.
It's OK, he's here.
What are you playing at?
You can't get out of here.
Put your bullets in the cylinder.
2 bullets!
Raise your gun!
Spin your cylinder!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
Don't look me in the eyes.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Shit!
He didn't have time.
The bullet's in the barrel.
Hans!
Come here, Hans.
Go get him.
350 on Number 7.
I lost my player.
I know, it's written here.
Shit happens.
No one will let me bet on another player.
Why not?
I don't know, I'm bad luck.
What can I do about it?
Don't you run this organization?
What's that change?
I'm here to gamble the 2 million in this case.
It's in your interest.
We don't force anyone into the shit.
You've already killed two.
That's great.
You can make big money.
When you start, you finish.
What's it to you?
1.5 million on Number 6.
Very well.
I did well to bet on your player.
You staying with us?
No.
With the 2 brothers.
I've gambled the lot.
If I lose, you'll have to go home alone.
Cut the crap.
Weird...
They're brothers.
God, I hate that number!
Forget it, it's nothing.
I said, forget it.
If he kills a third, you get a bonus.
That'd be wonderful.
Gentlemen!
Third round.
Let's go.
Now!
Get up!
Number 8...
Number 3...
Number 11...
Number 11!
Mr. Schlondorff, your player must get in the ring.
Just a second.
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
A touch of diarrhea.
Get him up there.
I'm gonna get you.
What a fucker!
What's he playing at?
He better calm down.
Supervisors, hand out the bullets now.
3 bullets per player.
Hand out 3 bullets!
Excuse me, Mr. Schmitt.
Can our player have a chair?
He's in pain.
Mr. André's asking, too.
You shouldn't be here.
Go back to the other side.
Give him a chair.
The gamblers must step back.
Sir!
Step back!
What's wrong with him?
He's drugged up.
Take him up to his room.
Quick!
Put the bullets in the cylinder!
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Oh, fuckin' hell!
Come.
Come here.
Gentlemen!
We've reached the final leg of our game.
The duel.
3 bullets in the cylinder.
Here are 4 balls.
2 are white.
2 are colored.
The 2 colored balls indicate the duelists.
I call on Numbers 1, 3, 6, and 13.
So everyone can see,
I want you to open them above your heads.
I want no ambiguity.
Gentlemen, good luck.
Numbers 6 and 13.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
I want to bet on your player.
- He's got no experience.
- Precisely.
I'm always luckier when I go against logic.
80%.
- That's a lot.
- You won't get less.
Well, I'll bet then.
I should get my share now.
The bets are low.
We won't make much.
I know you.
I fell... because of you.
What do you mean?
I've been thinking.
I want my share.
Go over to the wall.
You go over to your wall.
It's a piece of shit.
They're all the same.
Gentlemen, please.
One...
Two...
Three...
Very good.
OK with me.
Gentlemen, please be silent.
Silence, please.
Thank you.
I want the players to step forward.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
Stop!
Take aim!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Get ready!
The duel continues with 4 bullets in the cylinder.
One more bullet in the cylinder.
Supervisors, hand each player an extra bullet.
One, two, three, four bullets.
Players, step forward.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
Stop!
Take aim!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
It's over, gentlemen.
Finished.
All over, gentlemen.
Calm down.
It's over, finished.
The winner is Number 13.
Bravo!
Number 13, bravo!
Here's the winner.
Congratulations.
Go get your money.
Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- 850.
Thanks to you,
I've won back all I'd lost.
It was far from certain.
I'm not very lucky at the moment.
9... 10...
Give them a wad.
You're lucky, you know.
Your opponent already won 3 duels.
What about me?
Not giving me anything?
Got your money?
Yeah.
Are you pleased?
Want a lift?
Where to?
We'll leave you at the nearest station.
I'll get dressed and wait outside.
- Want a drink?
- No.
Where are you going?
- I'll go with him.
- Go up and get the coats.
- See Number 13?
- He took his stuff.
- Where is he?
- Open the trunk.
It was lucky he came.
What'd we have done?
Off you go.
10 euros, please.
Your receipt.
Goodbye.
Oh, it's you?
Yes, listen.
I sent you a parcel with money in it.
What money?
A lot of money.
Who gave it to you?
What is all this?
I'll tell you when I get back.
When will you be back?
No doubt tomorrow.
Why send it?
You could've brought it.
Something might happen before then.
It was safer that way.
When you get the receipt, go get the parcel.
What's going on?
Where are you?
Don't worry for now.
Everything's fine.
"For now"?
Where are you?
I'm calling just in case.
See you soon.
In case of what?
Everything's fine.
Take care.
Pleasant journey.
Bye.
- He's over there.
- OK, thanks.
Police!
Please stand up.
Raise your arms, please.
Please come with us.
Thanks.
What did you do with the money?
What money?
You're lucky you came back from there.
I don't know what you mean.
Sit down.
Sit!
I know where you were.
You stole the envelope from Godon's and you went in his place.
I'm not wrong, am I?
No, that's what happened.
Tell me in detail what happened there.
Where?
You know very well.
You went for the money.
I didn't make it.
I didn't get there.
Don't bullshit me.
You'll regret it.
I'm telling you the truth.
What car were they in at the crossroads?
A black Peugeot.
What did you say to the driver?
Nothing.
He refused to talk.
He said his job was to get me there.
Where did he drop you?
Somewhere in the forest.
What could you see there?
Other guys waiting for us.
Near a car.
What did you talk about?
I told them Mr. Godon was dead.
I offered to take his place, but they refused.
It didn't work out.
They must've decided I wasn't suitable.
You're lying.
You must've convinced them.
Otherwise you'd be dead now.
Who says they were going to let me live?
I ran away.
Once we'd talked, I saw one guy pull out his gun, and I ran for it.
Didn't they shoot?
Yes, they ran after me, shooting at me, but I got away.
I ran so much, I broke my heels.
Look.
Could you identify them?
Yes, of course.
Could you take me to the place in the forest?
I panicked and ran in the dark.
How could I remember?
You could, in a car from the crossroads.
No.
As I got in, the driver put a blindfold on me.
You're lying.
When I look at you,
I smell the stink of blood.
I've told you everything.
You've told me nothing.
I had a plan.
If you'd got out at the right station,
I'd have arrested the henchmen and made them talk.
Now I've lost my only lead.
What's this all about?
It's a dirty business.
A dirty business of murder.
There was another car in the forest.
I remember the number.
Tell me.
GR 1313.
What make of car was it?
A blue Peugeot 607.
But that's all I know, believe me.
10 euros, please.
Thanks.
Bye.

- Paris
So, have you finished?
Yes, that's it.
Any other plans?
I've got an address.
I'll go see tomorrow.
Where are you going?
To work.
it's not too early?
Recently, I've had to be there early.
So, it's finished?
Yes, that's it.
That's good.
- How much?
- Count!
Jean-Fran?
is!
What are you doing there?
Come into the house.
Hear me, Jean-Fran?
is?
Where are you going, you pig?
Help me!
Who do you think you are, you animal?
Wake up, asshole!
Wake up, you shit!
Wake up!
- What's wrong?
- He's just a pig.
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, he'll be alright soon.
We'll lift him up.
We have to make him run.
Come on.
No, that way.
If we don't bring him round, he's had it.
I think I passed out.
Come on, let's walk a bit.
- Who are you?
- Me?
He's working on the house.
You hired him.
There.
How old are you?
22,
That's really something.
Some people are 25 or 30,..
but to be 22,..
that's amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
I need to know what to expect.
I'll have lots of money soon.
Who'd give money to such an idiot?
I've already been paid.
Remember?
I never understood that.
- You never understood?
- Never.
And you never will.
Don't worry your head about it.
Did he give you the advance?
He promised me it in 3 days.
I can help you this weekend if you want.
That'd be great.
The roof beams need changing.
I'm off. I'm working tonight.
Leaving already?
Yeah.
Do you want a coffee?
- Want a coffee?
- No, thanks.
What's it about?
Dope?
Nothing like that.
That workman up there... needs his advance, but after that, I don't know how I'll pay him.
Don't you need someone?
No, and it's not my decision.
If it's to make someone pay up, that's my thing.
it's not.
I can't tell you any more.
I'm not sure I'll make it.
Put in a word for me.
Want to take my place?
I'm not sure they'll need me.
I'm stone-broke. I'm on the street.
If it works, I'll help you out.
How long will it take?
A day.
You'll earn that much in a day?
I doubt I'll get through it.
- lt worked last time.
- That was last time.
When do you go?
I don't know.
Last month, they said they'd summon me, but I haven't heard.
What did he want?
Money.
His business isn't going too well.
I don't think there's anything left.
Pity.
He paid for your lawyer when you were in jail.
I haven't forgotten.
- Know what your sister said?
- Don't start.
You belong in prison, nowhere else.
My sister always speaks the truth.
Always...
- How's it going?
- OK.
How long now?
10 days.
And the other side?
It'll all be finished in 10 days.
Good.
Hello.
I think he's had it.
A striped envelope.
No, I couldn't get it back.
I'll send you the photos.
Shit!
Hey, mister!
Where are you?
- What is it?
- Can you help me?
Quick!
What's wrong?
We must break the door down.
He's passed out.
There's an ax on the terrace.
Jean-Fran?
is!
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
He's dead.
- Aren't you tired?
- A bit.
How's things, Dad?
Fine.
- Hello, madam.
- Hello.
Come in.
Go on.
Thank you for yesterday.
That's OK. I'm sorry for you.
Don't be.
With the quantities he'd been taking, it was inevitable.
I hope you'll continue the work.
No.
His sister will inherit the house, so it's not my problem now.
Oh?
Look, I'm really sorry.
Who's going to pay me now?
I doubt his sister will ever come.
She'll get an agency to sell the house.
I never encouraged him to take that shit.
He doesn't need it anymore.
When are you leaving?
After the funeral.
He was waiting on a job.
Do you know about it?
Maybe the letter will come before you leave.
It came yesterday.
You've got it?
Can I see it?
There's nothing to see.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
What'll you do with it?
Get the ticket refunded.
I'll buy it off you.
OK, you can have it.
If it works, I won't forget you.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
Where was the ticket for?
Paris.
The name of the hotel?
That I do remember:
Windsor.
What did Pierre Bl?
ot intend to do with it?
To replace Jean-Fran?
is.
What does he know?
He just knew there was a lot of money at stake.
When did they discuss it?
Yesterday morning.
Did anyone go in other than the police and doctors?
No...
Yes, the workman.
I asked him to smash the door to the bathroom.
When did Mr Godon intend to leave?
Today.
Thank you very much.
Where were you during their talk?
- ln the corridor.
- You heard their words?
Of course.
Sorry, my brother over there has got it.
He'll show it to you.
Come with me, sir.
If you want the ticket, go see my brother over there.
But you have to be present.
Want me to throw you out, asshole?
You're crazy!
What is it, Ludo?
He wants the ticket, but won't move his fat ass.
Come on, I'll show you his ticket.
- Hello?
- Mr Godon?
Yeah.
Got a pen and paper?
Just a second.
By noon tomorrow, go to Gare du Nord.
Locker 103,
You'll find a train ticket with instructions.
The code is 402 # 4,
Get out one stop before the station on the ticket.
Don't forget: one stop before.
Jesus...
Good day, sir.
Your ticket, please.
Thank you.
Pleasant journey.
His stop's Valen?
y.
- What time?
- 5:08,
I'll see to it.
I need 2 unmarked cars, Valen?
y Station, 5:08,
Hello.
- Hello.
- Where to?
- Know where that is?
- Yes.
- ls it far?
- it's a fair way.
The number's 375 MHJ 45,
Get out.
Go over there.
- Undress.
- Why?
Gotta search you.
And the rest.
What the hell are you doing?
Get dressed.
I stopped there.
As I did a U-turn, he went to the sign.
Didn't it seem strange that he stopped here?
People can stop where they like.
You didn't notice anything else?
Nothing in particular.
Go sit down.
- You're here?
- Yeah, guess so.
- Found a player?
- Yeah.
- Don't like him?
- I do.
Each to his own!
Who's that?
I can explain.
Shut up!
Call Jos?
Go get Jos?

Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- 850,
Thanks to you,
I've won back all I'd lost.
It was far from certain.
I'm not very lucky at the moment.
9... 10...
Give them a wad.
You're lucky, you know.
Your opponent already won 3 duels.
What about me?
Not giving me anything?
Got your money?
Yeah.
Are you pleased?
Want a lift?
Where to?
We'll leave you at the nearest station.
I'll get dressed and wait outside.
- Want a drink?
- No.
Where are you going?
- I'll go with him.
- Go up and get the coats.
- See Number 13?
- He took his stuff.
- Where is he?
- Open the trunk.
It was lucky he came.
What'd we have done?
Off you go.
10 euros, please.
Your receipt.
Goodbye.
Oh, it's you?
Yes, listen.
I sent you a parcel with money in it.
What money?
A lot of money.
Who gave it to you?
What is all this?
I'll tell you when I get back.
When will you be back?
No doubt tomorrow.
Why send it?
You could've brought it.
Something might happen before then.
It was safer that way.
When you get the receipt, go get the parcel.
What's going on?
Where are you?
Don't worry for now.
Everything's fine.
"For now"?
Where are you?
I'm calling just in case.
See you soon.
In case of what?
Everything's fine.
Take care.
Pleasant journey.
Bye.
- He's over there.
- OK, thanks.
Police!
Please stand up.
Raise your arms, please.
Please come with us.
Thanks.
What did you do with the money?
What money?
You're lucky you came back from there.
I don't know what you mean.
Sit down.
Sit!
I know where you were.
You stole the envelope from Godon's and you went in his place.
I'm not wrong, am I?
No, that's what happened.
Tell me in detail what happened there.
Where?
You know very well.
You went for the money.
I didn't make it.
I didn't get there.
Don't bullshit me.
You'll regret it.
I'm telling you the truth.
What car were they in at the crossroads?
A black Peugeot.
What did you say to the driver?
Nothing.
He refused to talk.
He said his job was to get me there.
Where did he drop you?
Somewhere in the forest.
What could you see there?
Other guys waiting for us.
Near a car.
What did you talk about?
I told them Mr Godon was dead.
I offered to take his place, but they refused.
It didn't work out.
They must've decided I wasn't suitable.
You're lying.
You must've convinced them.
Otherwise you'd be dead now.
Who says they were going to let me live?
I ran away.
Once we'd talked, I saw one guy pull out his gun, and I ran for it.
Didn't they shoot?
Yes, they ran after me, shooting at me, but I got away.
I ran so much, I broke my heels.
Look.
Could you identify them?
Yes, of course.
Could you take me to the place in the forest?
I panicked and ran in the dark.
How could I remember?
You could, in a car from the crossroads.
No.
As I got in, the driver put a blindfold on me.
You're lying.
When I look at you, I smell the stink of blood.
I've told you everything.
You've told me nothing.
I had a plan. lf you'd got out at the right station,
I'd have arrested the henchmen and made them talk.
Now I've lost my only lead.
What's this all about?
it's a dirty business.
A dirty business of murder.
There was another car in the forest.
I remember the number.
Tell me.
GR 13 13.
What make of car was it?
A blue Peugeot 607.
But that's all I know, believe me.
10 euros, please.
Thanks.
Bye.

So, have you finished?
Yes, that's it.
Any other plans?
I've got an address.
I'll go see tomorrow.
Where are you going?
To work.
It's not too early?
Recently, I've had to be there early.
So, it's finished?
Yes, that's it.
That's good.
- How much?
- Count!
Jean-François!
What are you doing there?
Come into the house.
Hear me, Jean-François?
Where are you going, you pig?
Help me!
Who do you think you are, you animal?
Wake up, asshole!
Wake up, you shit!
Wake up!
- What's wrong?
- He's just a pig.
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, he'll be alright soon.
We'll lift him up.
We have to make him run.
Come on.
No, that way.
If we don't bring him round, he's had it.
I think I passed out.
Come on, let's walk a bit.
- Who are you?
- Me?
He's working on the house.
You hired him.
There.
How old are you?
22.
That's really something.
Some people are 25 or 30... but to be 22... that's amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
I need to know what to expect.
I'll have lots of money soon.
Who'd give money to such an idiot?
I've already been paid.
Remember?
I never understood that.
- You never understood?
- Never.
And you never will.
Don't worry your head about it.
Did he give you the advance?
He promised me it in 3 days.
I can help you this weekend if you want.
That'd be great.
The roof beams need changing.
I'm off. I'm working tonight.
Leaving already?
Yeah.
Do you want a coffee?
- Want a coffee?
- No, thanks.
What's it about?
Dope?
Nothing like that.
That workman up there... needs his advance, but after that, I don't know how I'll pay him.
Don't you need someone?
No, and it's not my decision.
If it's to make someone pay up, that's my thing.
It's not. I can't tell you any more.
I'm not sure I'll make it.
Put in a word for me.
Want to take my place?
I'm not sure they'll need me.
I'm stone-broke. I'm on the street.
If it works, I'll help you out.
How long will it take?
A day.
You'll earn that much in a day?
I doubt I'll get through it.
- lt worked last time.
- That was last time.
When do you go?
I don't know.
Last month, they said they'd summon me, but I haven't heard.
What did he want?
Money.
His business isn't going too well.
I don't think there's anything left.
Pity.
He paid for your lawyer when you were in jail.
I haven't forgotten.
- Know what your sister said?
- Don't start.
You belong in prison, nowhere else.
My sister always speaks the truth.
Always...
- How's it going?
- OK.
How long now?
10 days.
And the other side?
It'll all be finished in 10 days.
Good.
Hello. I think he's had it.
A striped envelope.
No, I couldn't get it back.
I'll send you the photos.
Shit!
Hey, mister!
Where are you?
- What is it?
- Can you help me?
Quick!
What's wrong?
We must break the door down.
He's passed out.
There's an ax on the terrace.
Jean-François!
What're you doing?
What're you doing?
He's dead.
- Aren't you tired?
- A bit.
How's things, Dad?
Fine.
- Hello, madam.
- Hello.
Come in.
Go on.
Thank you for yesterday.
That's OK. I'm sorry for you.
Don't be.
With the quantities he'd been taking, it was inevitable.
I hope you'll continue the work.
No.
His sister will inherit the house, so it's not my problem now.
Oh?
Look, I'm really sorry.
Who's going to pay me now?
I doubt his sister will ever come.
She'll get an agency to sell the house.
I never encouraged him to take that shit.
He doesn't need it anymore.
When are you leaving?
After the funeral.
He was waiting on a job.
Do you know about it?
Maybe the letter will come before you leave.
It came yesterday.
You've got it?
Can I see it?
There's nothing to see.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
What'll you do with it?
Get the ticket refunded.
I'll buy it off you.
OK, you can have it.
If it works, I won't forget you.
A train ticket and a paid hotel bill.
Where was the ticket for?
Paris.
The name of the hotel?
That I do remember:
Windsor.
What did Pierre Blérot intend to do with it?
To replace Jean-François.
What does he know?
He just knew there was a lot of money at stake.
When did they discuss it?
Yesterday morning.
Did anyone go in other than the police and doctors?
No...
Yes, the workman.
I asked him to smash the door to the bathroom.
When did Mr Godon intend to leave?
Today.
Thank you very much.
Where were you during their talk?
- ln the corridor.
- You heard their words?
Of course.
Sorry, my brother over there has got it.
He'll show it to you.
Come with me, sir.
If you want the ticket, go see my brother over there.
But you have to be present.
Want me to throw you out, asshole?
You're crazy!
What is it, Ludo?
He wants the ticket, but won't move his fat ass.
Come on, I'll show you his ticket.
- Hello?
- Mr Godon?
Yeah.
Got a pen and paper?
Just a second.
By noon tomorrow, go to Gare du Nord.
Locker 103.
You'll find a train ticket with instructions.
The code is 402 # 4.
Get out one stop before the station on the ticket.
Don't forget: one stop before.
Jesus...
Good day, sir.
Your ticket, please.
Thank you.
Pleasant journey.
His stop's Valençay.
- What time?
- 5:08.
I'll see to it.
I need 2 unmarked cars, Valençay Station, 5:08.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Where to?
- Know where that is?
- Yes.
- ls it far?
- lt's a fair way.
The number's 375 MHJ 45.
Get out.
Go over there.
- Undress.
- Why?
Gotta search you.
And the rest.
What the hell are you doing?
Get dressed.
I stopped there.
As I did a U-turn, he went to the sign.
Didn't it seem strange that he stopped here?
People can stop where they like.
You didn't notice anything else?
Nothing in particular.
Go sit down.
- You're here?
- Yeah, guess so.
- Found a player?
- Yeah.
- Don't like him?
- l do.
Each to his own!
Who's that?
I can explain.
Shut up!
Call José.
Go get José.
Hello, Alain.
This the boy who's playing?
Yes, it's him.
Good...
Brave...
There's only 13 of us.
Not many.
In Istanbul, there were 42 of us.
The opening bet was 500,000.
How much is it here?
If it's under 100,000, there's no point.
At least, otherwise it's not worth it.
Have you been around the place?
It's not very big.
Well, I'll wait downstairs.
Who's he?
What do you mean?
The guy from the crossroads.
- He had the card.
- l wasn't expecting him.
Jean-François is dead.
What're you talking about?
He took an overdose.
Let me see your papers.
Did he tell you about this?
I knew he was waiting for a letter.
He hoped to earn a lot.
I found it and followed the instructions.
Do you know what it's about?
No idea.
Maybe the cops sent him.
Who would agree to do that?
Maybe they didn't tell him.
That'd mean the cops are watching us and will show up.
So, it's now or never to get out.
If the cops show up and we've gone, they'll think I ratted.
I'd rather be arrested.
- ls your man here?
- Yes, no problem.
- We're about to start.
- Coming.
If I don't suit you, I can leave.
You can't leave now.
What if it doesn't suit me?
You gotta play now.
- How much are you betting?
- Dunno.
What do you think?
Dunno.
Don't ask me.
I'm gonna bet the minimum.
My cylinder doesn't work.
What's going on?
- His gun won't work.
- So, change it!
Supervisors, hand out one bullet to each player.
I should get my share now.
You've gotta see it through.
Man is only born once and only dies once.
Get ready!
Nothing else happens.
- Be philosophical.
- Round 1's starting.
You're a descendant of Schopenhauer.
Mr Schlöndorff, go the other side, please.
OK, I'm going.
Be philosophical about it.
Get ready!
Round 1 is about to start.
Excuse me.
Blow up a head for me.
The audience must step back.
Step back... back...
This'll bring you luck.
More...
Thank you.
Load your cylinder!
Number 13, got a problem?
Problem with your gun?
Got a problem?
Nobody get in the ring.
- Get out.
- He can't load it.
Give it here.
This is to open the cylinder, OK?
OK, that's enough.
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer.
Number 13, don't turn your head.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Everyone stare at the bulb.
Wait!
Wait!
Number 13 didn't shoot.
Shoot!
Why won't you shoot?
Shoot!
Mr Alain, what's got into your player?
If he doesn't, we'll shoot him, and you'll get fined!
I'll count to three.
One...
Go on, shoot!
Two...
Hey, get out of the ring.
You finished your scene, you shit?
Shit to you, too!
Don't start that crap again.
Why didn't you shoot?
Why didn't you?
You gotta shoot, dammit!
Want some morphine?
No, I don't.
Morphine's fuckin' cool.
They all take it.
Who's not had his dose?
- Us.
- Come on, then.
I bet 500,000 on Number 13.
Get lost!
I want to bet on you.
Beat it, you little shit!
I've lost my player.
Can I bet on yours?
I want 50% of your cut.
Alright.
Just for this round.
OK.
Put your name down on Number 13.
350 on Number 13.
350 on Number 10.
C'mon, get him up here.
It's OK, he's here.
What are you playing at?
You can't get out of here.
Put your bullets in the cylinder.
2 bullets!
Raise your gun!
Spin your cylinder!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
Don't look me in the eyes.
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!
Shit!
He didn't have time.
The bullet's in the barrel.
Hans!
Come here, Hans.
Go get him.
350 on Number 7.
I lost my player.
I know, it's written here.
Shit happens.
No one will let me bet on another player.
Why not?
I don't know, I'm bad luck.
What can I do about it?
Don't you run this organization?
What's that change?
I'm here to gamble the 2 million in this case.
It's in your interest.
We don't force anyone into the shit.
You've already killed two.
That's great.
You can make big money.
When you start, you finish.
What's it to you?
1 .5 million on Number 6.
Very well.
I did well to bet on your player.
You staying with us?
No.
With the 2 brothers.
I've gambled the lot.
If I lose, you'll have to go home alone.
Cut the crap.
Weird...
They're brothers.
God, I hate that number!
Forget it, it's nothing.
I said, forget it.
If he kills a third, you get a bonus.
That'd be wonderful.
Gentlemen!
Third round.
Let's go.
Now!
Get up!
Number 8...
Number 3...
Number 1 1 ...
Number 1 1 !
Mr Schlöndorff, your player must get in the ring.
Just a second.
What is it?
Oh, nothing.
A touch of diarrhea.
Get him up there.
I'm gonna get you.
What a fucker!
What's he playing at?
He better calm down.
Supervisors, hand out the bullets now.
3 bullets per player.
Hand out 3 bullets!
Excuse me, Mr Schmitt.
Can our player have a chair?
He's in pain.
Mr André's asking, too.
You shouldn't be here.
Go back to the other side.
Give him a chair.
The gamblers must step back.
Sir!
Step back!
What's wrong with him?
He's drugged up.
Take him up to his room.
Quick!
Put the bullets in the cylinder!
Raise your gun!
Spin the cylinder!
More!
More!
Stop!
Take aim!
Cock the hammer!
When the bulb lights up, you shoot!

We've reached the final leg of our game.
The duel.
3 bullets in the cylinder.
Here are 4 balls.
2 are white.
2 are colored.
The 2 colored balls indicate the duelists.
I call on Numbers 1 , 3, 6, and 13.
So everyone can see, I want you to open them above your heads.
I want no ambiguity.
Gentlemen, good luck.
Numbers 6 and 13.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
I want to bet on your player.
- He's got no experience.
- Precisely.
I'm always luckier when I go against logic.
80% .
- That's a lot.
- You won't get less.
Well, I'll bet then.
I should get my share now.
The bets are low.
We won't make much.
I know you.
I fell... because of you.
What do you mean?
I've been thinking.
I want my share.

- Jaffa?
- Quiet!
It is nothing.
He's not doing that on purpose is he?
You know, just to keep me interested?
Well that depends.
Are you losing interest?
No!
We haven't found so much as a snapped twig, on this planet, but hey, hey, it's all good, baby.
Teal'c's intel did suggest that the Sodan were rumoured to have a base of operations here.
Teal'c's intel came from a bunch of Jaffa he used to be at war with, you know?
Old enemies and new allies and all that jazz.
But still.
You think the information's bad?
I think it's vague.
A world once inhabited by Ancients.
A village shrouded in the mists of time.
Sounds like a movie trailer.
Well we've found some pretty interesting things based on vague.
Yeah.
Still, I'm getting that grasping at straws feeling.
Just don't tell Teal'c.
- I already did.
- And what did he say?
The warriors of the Sodan exist, Colonel Mitchell!
I am certain of it.
Need's more base.
Down!
Fall back to the gate, I got our six.
Go, go, go!
Where the hell are they?
SG22, this is SG1.
We are under attack!
We need backup!

Colonel, we're reading UAV telemetry, five by five.
So far, no sign of Colonel Mitchell.
Let me know when you've completed your first sweep.
Affirmative.
SGC out.
Anything?
- Not yet.
How's he doing?
- Not well.
His symbiote is dying.
If it is not removed, the host will die also.

Radio Dr Lam.
Let her know we have a priority one medical emergency incoming.
No tattoo.
He is a warrior of the Sodan.
According to legend, no Sodan has been indentured to the Goa'uld for over 5000 years.
So your intel was correct.
Indeed.
Colonel Carter.
There's something you need to see.
- This writing.
- Ancient.
- Look familiar?
- Nope.

I have never before seen such a device.
Well, I'm detecting energy readings.
It's definitely some form of technology.
Perhaps this is how the Sodan managed to escape so quickly.
Actually, that's exactly what it is.
This say's it's some sort of aperture or gateway to...
- To where?
- Enlightenment.
Just enlightenment?
Nothing more specific?
That's all it say's.
Hold still!
You know, your bedside manner totally blows.
Your wound is infected.
It must be cleansed or you will die.
This will cause you a fair amount of pain.
God!
How's it going in there?
Touch and go.
They've been at it for nearly six hours now.
Most Jaffa would not survive such injuries.
Well she's very good.
That's why she's here.
Looks like you were both right about the device he was wearing.
More Ancient technology.
A cloak of invisibility.
That explains how they were able to ambush you so easily.
What about the transporter?
Carter's with a team on the planet, working on it right now.
So far that haven't been able to even open up the damn thing.
Let alone turn it on.
Yeah, sorry I couldn't have been more help.
Well one line of Ancient text isn't a hell of a lot to go on.
We're running surface scans with Prometheus on several moons and other planet's in the system.
You believe Colonel Mitchell is no longer on P9G-844.
It's a possibility.
Ground sweeps and UAV scans are all coming up empty.
Don't move!
Don't make a sound.
You call to the others and it's goodbye Jaffa.
It would seem you have me at a disadvantage.
It certainly appears that way.
Now, you're gonna tell me how I get...
How things seem and how they truly are, are two very different things.
For example.
You are free to leave this place whenever you choose.
What now you're telling me?
But to reach the Chaapa'ai, would take months on foot to the mountains of Dor'ta'nak.
No-one who's attempted the journey has ever survived.
So how did we get here?
We were brought here through the eye of the God's.
- Which is?
- Your questions can wait!
Now that your strength has returned, we should begin joma'shay'telak immediately.
If that's breakfast, I could eat.
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior.
Did you think our mercy was without purpose?
Lord Haikon has decreed that you will answer for your crimes by way of Kel'shak'lo.
Which you will battle with another warrior.
And on that day, you will die.
I take it from all the beeping, our friend is still with us.
That he is.
Though how he survived is a mystery to me.
Well I'd say that nine hours you spent working on him might have something to do with it.
Nice work.
I could to save him, but his symbiote was too badly damaged.
We had no choice but to remove it and start him on tretonin.
As soon as he regains consciousness, I wanna know.
Why?
So you can interrogate him?
Well that might be more up Teal'c's alley, but that's the idea.
Well it wasn't exactly the kind of post op recovery I had in mind.
Well let me know the moment he wakes up.
Ok.
Lt Col Cameron Mitchell.
United States Air Force.
Earth.
I don't know if you know what's been going on out there, but things are a little different now.
The Goa'uld have been defeated.
The Goa'uld should have been defeated 5000 years ago.
My ancestors were one of the first to the Sodan.
They were part of an elite command force under the Goa'uld Ishkar.
For years, they pillaged and plundered under his name.
Driving fear into the hearts of all those who would oppose his fear.
The further they ascended among the ranks, the more they were able to discern the truth.
That he was not a God at all, but merely an imposter.
Our true God's are those that came before us.
You're talking about the Ancients.
Ishkar branded my ancestors as traitors and ordered their deaths.
They tried to fight to show their brothers their faith.
But the odds were too great.
They were forced to flee, but they set out to find Keb, hoping that their souls would find peace.
But instead their search led them to this world.
You knew about the Goa'uld, but you didn't help the other Jaffa defeat them.
Look, for the first time in their history, the Jaffa are free.
But it won't last without strong leadership.
They need your help.
Their fate is of no concern to us.
I hope you are prepared to die well, Mitchell.
You will not be able to break your bonds.
We sought out the Sodan in peace.
We wished only to open dialogue.
Instead you attacked us and took our comrade.
All enemies who our transgress our sacred ground, sacrifice their lives.
Yeah well, you might want to post a few signs.
Look, we just want our friend back.
We figured that your fellow warrior's may wanna know that you're still alive and kicking, so we're thinking straight swap.
Our guy in exchange for you.
If your friend was taken, then mourn him.
For if he is not yet dead, he soon will be.
Hear me when I say that all free Jaffa have always had the greatest respect for the warriors of Sodan.
You speak of respect, yet you condemn me.
Without my symbiote, I will be dead soon enough!
A medicine called tretonin, courses through your veins.
You have been freed from your burden.
Such a thing is not possible.
OH, but it is.
It is very real, I assure you.
It is now used by several thousand free Jaffa, with no ill effects.
Your poison's will not work.
Had you any honour, you would have let me die on the battlefield.
So is it you just don't know what's going on in the rest of the galaxy or you really don't care?
The Jaffa made their choice 5000 years ago.
Their affairs are no concern to us.
Yeah, but how do you survive?
At some point you gotta go hunting for.....you know.
We raid Goa'uld strongholds for shipments of symbiotes that have yet to be implanted in any Jaffa.
Such missions are rites of passage for our youngest warriors.
Well it sounds like fun.
The fighting style of Sodan has been a closely guarded secret for a hundred generations.
It is a shame you will die shortly after learning it.
Attack me.
You find me an unworthy opponent?
No, it's just I don't feel like...
Ok, let's try that one more time.
You are slow and undisciplined.
If you fought your opponent today, you would die without landing a single blow.
And what happens if I refuse to fight?
You just kill me?
It is an alternative you do not wish to explore.
Dr Lam tells me you have refused to eat.
The very odour of your food, turns my stomach.
If you are to survive without your symbiote, you require sustenance.
It is only because your drug has weakened me.
On the contrary brother, it has freed you.
What do you know of freedom, hmmm?
You who have served false God's.
Who chooses to live in this squalor, rather than among his own people.
I know that I have heard stories of the Sodan, since I was but a child.
Your bravery and skill are legend among all Jaffa.
It is because of my failure as a warrior that I languish here now.
Prisoner to a former slave and his pitiful allies.
Speak not of skill to me.
Many Jaffa have fought and died for a cause that was started by the warriors of the Sodan!
And for what?
Instead of respecting the traditions of OUR ancestors, you would only seek to lead them further astray!
That way.
Blue is left.
Red is right.
Got it!
- Faster!
- Faster!
How did I do?
Badly.
Again!
Yeah, yeah.
You stop using that gadget, I guarantee you, I'll be better.
A Sodan warrior must anticipate attack at any moment.
Yeah well, where'd you guy's get those things, anyway?
The writings of our God's instructed us how to construct many of their devices.
We use them to protect our sacred grounds.
Speaking of God's, I know this is probably taboo, but I need to talk to your boss.
That visitor you had yesterday.
I'm assuming it's not the first time he's been here.
I've met their kind before.
They're bad news.
Look, I'll do any crazy, training exercise you want within reason.
Finish the course in time and I'll consider it.
You know, a bag of sand is not an accurate timing device.
You are an evil man!
Please, sit.
I'm good.....
Ok.
Maybe I will sit.
You know, I'm starting to get an idea of why you guy's attacked us.
That Prior's telling you we're enemies.
Is he wrong?
You could have cut us down the second we stepped through the gate, but you didn't.
Generations of my people fought and died under exile.
Praying for the day when we could seek the path without recrimination.
When we pray to the God's.
Do they hear us, Mitchell?
Do they once give us a sign as proof of their existence.
I know that the Ori are not the Ancients.
But can there be any doubt that they are Gods?
And if they can lead us to the path of enlightenment, how can I refuse them?
You're making a big mistake.
These Ori are not what you think they are.
They are not even close.
Ta'kel'syn!
Perhaps, when you finish your debt.
In your final moments, you'll understand.
Already been there.
I understand.
- You may rest now.
- No, I'm good, let's keep going.
You are not tired?
Six weeks Air Force training at Fort Benning, that's tiring.
This is nothing.
Come on!
I'm gonna survive this Kel'shak'lo thing, I'm gonna need a hell of a lot more than you're teaching me.
Quit pussy footing around and stop holding back.
Let's go!
You believe this staff is what makes you strong.
The Kran'too is nothing but an extension of your body.
No true warrior depends on a weapon for strength or advantage.
See, that's what I'm talking about!
Drink.
I'm not gonna get used to this stuff.
Were it not for my tea's, you would have died many day's ago.
It was self defence, you know.
The Jaffa I killed.
It was him or me.
It does not matter.
Blood has been spilled.
Our laws decree you must answer for it.
So who was it?
His name was Volnek.
A most skilled warrior.
Look, for what it's worth?
There's nothing I can say, is there?
No.
So, who do I fight?
Lord Haikon will determine that on the eve of the battle.
Usually it is the closest blood kin to the slain warrior.
Right.
And the next of kin is just as tough as he was.
Do I stand a chance?
Never mind.
I promise I'll die well and all that jazz.
But before I kick it, I gotta ask.
You buying what these Prior's are selling?
Lord Haikon has led us for more than a hundred years.
He knows what is best for us all.
Yeah, yea, look, I get it, you are a team player.
I'm asking you, what do you think?
It is not my place to question Haikon's judgement.
Nor is it yours!
Well somebody better, because if you guy's follow the Ori, All of your traditions, your Kran'too staff's, your precious path, your tasty beverages, it's all going down the drain!
Enough!
We're finished for the day.
You say a Prior has come to the Sodan and you have decided to follow the word of the Ori.
I walk the path of our true God's...
The Ori are not God's!
What did the Ori promise you?
A place of honour at his side.
As heralds for your new masters.
This Prior will have you hunt down and kill all Jaffa who refuse to follow the path of Origin.
That is the path you walk.
I will learn the codes of the Ancient transporter.
No matter how long it takes.
This is going nowhere.
Two weeks and he hasn't so much as given us a decent high coo.
Well, it's understandable, sir.
Most Jaffa would never break under normal interrogation techniques.
Not to mention the fact that the Sodan are an elite group of warriors.
I'm sure their minds are trained to withstand a lot worse.
What about the device?
We haven't made much progress, I'm afraid.
It seem's the code preventing us using it, is rigged to some sort of defence mechanism.
Dr Lee received a few nasty volts, while trying to implemet an override.
How is he?
Dr Lam say's the feelings should return to his legs in a few day's.
Meanwhile, the international committee is keeping score of all the resources we're using to try to find Mitchell.
Science teams, orbital scans by Prometheus.
All of them coming up empty certainly doesn't look good.
Another few day's and they'll tell us to shut down search and rescue operations.
Shut it down.
Sir, with all due respect, in the past we have spent months searching for our people in the field.
We can't just stop looking.
What she's saying sir is, we've never left a man behind.
I'm more than familiar with the concept, Dr Jackson.
Give me something I can use...soon, or the next paperwork I fill out will declare Mitchell, MIA.
I just need a minute!
Let him pass!
Thankyou.
Alright, I'll make this quick.
The Prior represents a race of Ancients, yes!
But believe me when I tell you, they are not the Ancients you wanna worship.
The Prior has healed our sick.
Caused our crops to grow as if by magic.
Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?
Look, their power is not what you should question.
It's how they use it!
Anyone refuses to worship them and they die.
And I'm not talking about a few non believer's here and there.
I'm talking about whole planet's wiped out!
And I should simply take your word for this?
You wanna believe my people are Godless and inferior?
Go right ahead.
But we have never needed proof our of God's existence in order to believe in them.
Faith.
It was your faith that sustained you for 5000 years, not the Ancients themselves.
Don't throw your history away for a bag full of magic tricks.
Admit it!
Haikon has totally lost his mind.
A warrior cannot talk and fight at the same time.
A fact you refuse to accept.
Got it.
You may provide a challenge to your opponent after all, Mitchell.
Followed by my violent death of course.
Of course.
To my inevitable demise!
Why do you do this?
Do what?
Train this hard.
These are the last day's of your life.
I would think you would spend more time in reflection.
Hell, all I know is, the moment you accept your fate, that's when you're as good as dead.
Till then, all bet's are off.
You cannot survive Kel'shak'lo!
Well no offence, but I've endured things I wasn't supposed to of survived before and I'm still here.
How can you be certain the Prior speaks falsely?
Because I've seen entire planet's wiped out because they refused to follow the Ori.
Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to think, but if everything I believed was being threatened.
I'd wanna know.
Jolan, your people shouldn't suffer for their faith.
You two, again.
Yes.
Us two, again.
Save your words, I amm not in the mood.
We know how you feel, but we're not here to talk.
They require evidence that the Ori are not to be trusted.
This is Tasan.
One of the founders on a free Jaffa settlement on a planet called Sarvarus.
Many families came to live there to enjoy the freedom that they'd fought so hard to achieve.
He is Sodan?
Indeed.
Tell him what happened.
A month ago, a man came through the Chaapa'ai.
He called himself a Prior.
He told us of powerful Gods called the Ori, ...who he claimed would give us protection and show us the path to enlightenment.
Then he left.
He later returned.
Told us we had to make a choice.
Follow the Ori or be destroyed.
We chose to resist.
Continue brother.
He dialed the Chaapa'ai and merely placed his staff in the ground in front of it.
Then the Earth shook with a fierceness I have never seen nor heard of before.
In moments, our city was levelled.
Hundreds of our people wiped out in an instant.
Enough of these lies!
You expect me to take the word of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa?
I witnessed the destruction with my own eyes!
Heed my words brother.
If a Prior visits your world, leave.
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior!
Human!
Do you deny it?
No, but it wasn't...
No, I don't deny it.
If any blood kin of the warrior seek recompense.
Let them step forward, now!
I seek it.
You.
In the name of Volnek of Gashrail, my brother.
May the blood spilled here today, settle this debt once and for all.
You may begin!
May you die well.
Likewise.
The human is dead!
The blood of the Sodan has been avenged.
He fought and died a warrior, my Lord.
It is only fitting he be given the rite of Shel'mak'asah.
Very well.
With your permission my Lord, I would like to take care of it myself.
I was afraid you would not wake.
Well maybe I shouldn't have.
How long was I ...
Seven hours.
Seven?
I thought it was only supposed to be two?
I may have inadvertantly made the elixer to strong.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, that's gonna leave a scar.
So, did it work?
The elixer was most effective.
They believe you are dead.
Well done, Bones.
Never mind.
So, where does this leave you?
If the Prior intends to mislead the Sodan as you say?
Then I am his enemy.
And Haikon?
It may be too late to convince him of his mistake.
But there are several other warriors who feel as I do.
We will continue to walk the path of the Sodan, until the others see the error of their ways.
Well, for what it's worth, you won't walk alone.
Come!
- How did it go?
- Not well.
Even after we showed him video footage of the damage, ...Volnek still refuses to believe the Ori are responsible for what happened on Sarvarus.
What's he doing now?
Nothing.
He hasn't said a word since Tasan left.
- Which put's us back to square one.
- Yeah basically.
- Teal'c seems to think that showing him more images...
- Unscheduled offworld activation!
What have we got, Chief?
Recieving an IDC sir.
It's Colonel Mitchell.
You're kidding?
I would never do that, sir.
You have a visitor.
You!
Yeah, I thought you were dead, too.
Oh, we have unfinished business!
Just take it easy.
- You shot me!
- You shot me first!
I will have vengeance!
You will listen, brother.
I know that you think we're enemies and right now it doesn't matter if we become allies.
What matters is that you understand the truth.
You are fortunate my brother drugged you.
You would never have survived a true Kel'shak'lo.
Don't know.
Took you down pretty good.
You were lucky.
Lucky is good.
Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.
We will meet again.
Looking forward to it.
What you got?
- Jaffa?
- Quiet!
It is nothing.
just to keep me interested?
Well that depends.
Are you losing interest?
No!
baby.
Teal'c's intel did suggest that the Sodan were rumoured to have a base of operations here.
Teal'c's intel came from a... you know?
Old enemies and new allies and all that jazz.
But still.
You think the information's bad?
I think it's vague.
A world once inhabited by Ancients.
A village shrouded in the mists of time." Sounds like a movie trailer.
Well we've found some pretty interesting things based on vague.
I'm getting that grasping at straws feeling.
just don't tell Teal'c.
I already did.
what did he say?
Colonel Mitchell!
I am certain of it.
Needs more bass.
Go!
go!
Where the hell are they?
this is SG-1.
We are under attack!
We need backup!
Where the hell is Mitchell?
what's your position?
do you copy?
His wound is grave my Lord.
His symbiote is badly damaged.
No!
Bring him!
Shal' Kree!
Season 9
- Episode 8 Babylon
He'll be dead by sunset.
If not sooner.
Then... you must keep him alive.
Chief?
five by five.
no sign of Colonel Mitchell.
Let me know when you've completed your first sweep.
Affirmative.
SGC out.
- Anything?
- Not yet.
How's he doing?
Not well.
His symbiote is dying.
the host will die also.
radio Dr Lam.
Let her know we have a priority one medical emergency incoming.
No tattoo.
He is a warrior of the Sodan.
no Sodan has been indentured to the Goa'uld for over 5000 years.
So your intel was correct.
Indeed.
Colonel Carter.
There's something you need to see.
- This writing.
- Ancient.
Look familiar?
Nope.
Teal'c?
I have never before seen such a device.
I'm detecting energy readings.
It's definitely some form of technology.
Perhaps this is how the Sodan managed to escape so quickly.
that's exactly what it is.
This says it's some sort of aperture or gateway to...
- To where?
- Enlightenment.
Just enlightenment?
Nothing more specific?
That's all it says.
Hold still!
your bedside manner totally blows.
Your wound is infected.
or you will die.
This... will cause you a fair amount... of pain.
How's it going in there?
Touch and go.
They've been at it for nearly six hours now.
Most Jaffa would not survive such wounds.
Wich means she's very good.
That's why she's here.
Looks like you were both right about the device he was wearing.
More Ancient technology.
A cloak of invisibility.
That explains how they were able to ambush you so easily.
What about the transporter?

we should begin Joma'Sha'Tal'ac immediately.
I could eat.
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior.
Did you think our mercy was without purpose?
Lord Haikon has decreed that you will answer for your crimes by way of Kel Shak Lo.
Which you will battle with another warrior. you will die.
our friend is still with us.
That he is.
Though how he survived is a mystery to me.
I'd say that nine hours you spent working on him might have something to do with it.

He knows what is best for us all.
what do you think?
It is not my place to question Haikon's judgement.
Nor is it yours! it's all going down the drain!
Enough!
We're finished for the day.
You say a Prior has come to the Sodan and you have decided to follow the word of the Ori.
- I walk the path of our true Gods...
- The Ori are not Gods!
What did the Prior promise you?
A place of honour at his side.
As heralds for your new masters.
This Prior will have you hunt down and kill all Jaffa who refuse to follow the path of Origin.
That is the path you walk.
I will learn the codes of the Ancient transporter.
No matter how long it takes.
This is going nowhere.
Two weeks and he hasn't given us so much as a decent high coo.
Sir.
Most Jaffa would never break under normal interrogation techniques.
Not to mention the fact that the Sodan are an elite group of warriors.
I'm sure their minds are trained to withstand a lot worse.
What about the device?
I'm afraid.
is rigged to some sort of defence mechanism.
while trying to implement an override.
How is he?
Dr Lam says the feelings should return to his legs in a few days.
the international committee is keeping score of all the resources we're using to try to find Mitchell.
orbital scans by Prometheus.
All of them coming up empty certainly doesn't look good.
Another few days and they'll tell us to shut down search and rescue operations.
Shut it down?
in the past we have spent months searching for our people in the field.
We can't just stop looking.
is we've never left a man behind.
soon.
Or the next paperwork I fill out will declare Mitchell MIA.
I just need a minute!
Let him pass.
Thank you.
I'll make this quick. they are not the Ancients you wanna worship.
The Prior has healed our sick.
Caused our crops to grow as if by magic.
Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?
their power is not what you should question.
It's how they use it!
Anyone refuses to worship them and they die.
And I'm not talking about a few non believers here and there.
I'm talking about whole planets wiped out!
And I should simply take your word for this?
You wanna believe my people are godless and inferior?
Go right ahead.
But we have never needed proof of our Gods' existence in order to believe in them.
Faith. not the Ancients themselves.
Don't throw your history away for a bag full of magic tricks.
Admit it!
Haikon has totally lost his mind.
A warrior cannot talk and fight at the same time.
A fact you refuse to accept.
Got it.
Mitchell.
Followed by my violent death of course.
Of course.
To my inevitable demise!
Why do you do this?
Do what?
Train this hard.
These are the last days of your life.
I would think you would spend more time in reflexion. that's when you're as good as dead.
all bets are off.
You cannot survive Kel Shak Lo.
but
I've endured things I wasn't supposed to survive before and
I'm still here.
How can you be certain the Prior speaks falsely?
Because...
I've seen entire planets wiped out because they refused to follow the Ori.
I'd wanna know.
your people shouldn't suffer for their faith.
again.
again.
I am not in the mood.
but we're not here to talk.
You require evidence that the Ori are not to be trusted.
This is Tass'an.
One of the founders of a free Jaffa settlement on a planet called Sarvarus.
Many families came to live there to enjoy the freedom that they fought so hard to achieve.
He is Sodan?
Indeed.
Tell him what happened.
a man came through the Chaapa'ai.
He called himself a Prior.
who he claimed would give us protection and show us the path to enlightenment.
And he left.
He later returned.
Told us we had to make a choice.
Follow the Ori... or be destroyed.
We chose to resist.
brother.
He dialed the Chaapa'ai and merely placed his staff in the ground in front of it.
Then earth shook with a fierceness I have never seen nor heard of before.
our city was levelled.
Hundreds of our people wiped out in an instant.
Enough of these lies.
You expect me to take the word of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa?
I witnessed the destruction with my own eyes!
brother. leave. do you deny it?
but it wasn't...
I don't deny it. now!
I seek it.
You? my brother.
settle this debt once and for all.
You may begin!
May you die well.
Likewise.
The human is dead!
The blood of the Sodan has been avenged.
my Lord.
It is only fitting he be given the rite of Shel'mak'asah.
Very well.
I would like to take care of it myself.
I was afraid you would not wake.
Well maybe I shouldn't have.
- How long was I...
- Seven hours.
Seven?
I thought it was only supposed to be two?
I may have inadvertently made the elixir to strong.
that's gonna leave a scar.
did it work?
The elixir was most effective.
They believe you are dead.
Bones.
Never mind.
where does this leave you? then I am his enemy.
And Haikon?
It may be too late to convince him of his mistake.
But there are several other warriors who feel as I do. until the others see the error of their ways. you won't walk alone.
Come!
How did it go?
Not well.
Volnek still refuses to believe the Ori are responsible for what happened on Sarvarus.
What's he doing now?
Nothing.
He hasn't said a word since Tass'an left.
Which puts us back to square one.
Yeah basically.
- Teal'c seems to think that showing him more images...
- Unscheduled offworld activation!
Chief?
Recieving an IDC Sir.
It's Colonel Mitchell.
You're kidding?
Sir.
You have a visitor.
You!
too.
we have unfinished business!
Just take it easy.
You shot me!
You shot me first!
I will have vengeance!
brother.
I know that you think we're enemies and right now it doesn't matter if we become allies.
What matters is that you understand the truth.
You are fortunate my brother drugged you.
You would never have survived a true Kel Shak Lo.
Don't know.
Took you down pretty good.
You were lucky.
Lucky is good.
Mitchell.
We will meet again.
Looking forward to it.
What you got?
- Jaffa?
- Quiet!
It is nothing.
He's not doing that on purpose is he?
You know, just to keep me interested?
Well that depends.
Are you losing interest?
No!
We haven't found so much as a snapped twig, on this planet, but hey, hey, it's all good, baby.
Teal'c's intel did suggest that the Sodan were rumoured to have a base of operations here.
Teal'c's intel came from a bunch of Jaffa he used to be at war with, you know?
Old enemies and new allies and all that jazz.
But still.
You think the information's bad?
I think it's vague.
A world once inhabited by Ancients.
A village shrouded in the mists of time.
Sounds like a movie trailer.
Well we've found some pretty interesting things based on vague.
Yeah.
Still, I'm getting that grasping at straws feeling.
Just don't tell Teal'c.
- I already did.
- And what did he say?
The warriors of the Sodan exist, Colonel Mitchell!
I am certain of it.
Need's more base.
Down!
Fall back to the gate, I got our six.
Go, go, go!
Where the hell are they?
SG22, this is SG1.
We are under attack!
We need backup!
Where the hell is Mitchell?
Cameron, what's your position?
Cameron, do you copy?
His wounds are great my Lord.
His symbiote is greatly damaged.
No!
Leave him!
Shar'l kree!
Stargete SG-1 **Babylon**

He'll be dead by sunset.
If not sooner.
Then you must keep him alive.
Carter to SGC.
You got anything for me yet, Chief?
Colonel, we're reading UAV telemetry, five by five.
So far, no sign of Colonel Mitchell.
Let me know when you've completed your first sweep.
Affirmative.
SGC out.
Anything?
- Not yet.
How's he doing?
- Not well.
His symbiote is dying.
If it is not removed, the host will die also.
SGT.
Radio Dr Lam.
Let her know we have a priority one medical emergency incoming.
No tattoo.
He is a warrior of the Sodan.
According to legend, no Sodan has been indentured to the Goa'uld for over 5000 years.
So your intel was correct.
Indeed.
Colonel Carter.
There's something you need to see.
- This writing.
- Ancient.
- Look familiar?
- Nope.
Teal'c?
I have never before seen such a device.
Well, I'm detecting energy readings.
It's definitely some form of technology.
Perhaps this is how the Sodan managed to escape so quickly.
Actually, that's exactly what it is.
This say's it's some sort of aperture or gateway to...
- To where?
- Enlightenment.
Just enlightenment?
Nothing more specific?
That's all it say's.
Hold still!
You know, your bedside manner totally blows.
Your wound is infected.
It must be cleansed or you will die.
This will cause you a fair amount of pain.
God!
How's it going in there?
Touch and go.
They've been at it for nearly six hours now.
Most Jaffa would not survive such injuries.
Well she's very good.
That's why she's here.
Looks like you were both right about the device he was wearing.
More Ancient technology.
A cloak of invisibility.
That explains how they were able to ambush you so easily.
What about the transporter?
Carter's with a team on the planet, working on it right now.
So far that haven't been able to even open up the damn thing.
Let alone turn it on.
Yeah, sorry I couldn't have been more help.
Well one line of Ancient text isn't a hell of a lot to go on.
We're running surface scans with Prometheus on several moons and other planet's in the system.
You believe Colonel Mitchell is no longer on P9G-844.
It's a possibility.
Ground sweeps and UAV scans are all coming up empty.
Don't move!
Don't make a sound.
You call to the others and it's goodbye Jaffa.
It would seem you have me at a disadvantage.
It certainly appears that way.
Now, you're gonna tell me how I get...
How things seem and how they truly are, are two very different things.
For example.
You are free to leave this place whenever you choose.
What now you're telling me?
But to reach the Chaapa'ai, would take months on foot to the mountains of Dor'ta'nak.
No-one who's attempted the journey has ever survived.
So how did we get here?
We were brought here through the eye of the God's.
- Which is?
- Your questions can wait!
Now that your strength has returned, we should begin joma'shay'telak immediately.
If that's breakfast, I could eat.
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior.
Did you think our mercy was without purpose?
Lord Haikon has decreed that you will answer for your crimes by way of Kel'shak'lo.
Which you will battle with another warrior.
And on that day, you will die.
I take it from all the beeping, our friend is still with us.
That he is.
Though how he survived is a mystery to me.
Well I'd say that nine hours you spent working on him might have something to do with it.
Nice work.
I could to save him, but his symbiote was too badly damaged.
We had no choice but to remove it and start him on tretonin.
As soon as he regains consciousness, I wanna know.
Why?
So you can interrogate him?
Well that might be more up Teal'c's alley, but that's the idea.
Well it wasn't exactly the kind of post op recovery I had in mind.
Well let me know the moment he wakes up.
Ok.
Lt Col Cameron Mitchell.
United States Air Force.
Earth.
I don't know if you know what's been going on out there, but things are a little different now.
The Goa'uld have been defeated.
The Goa'uld should have been defeated 5000 years ago.
My ancestors were one of the first to the Sodan.
They were part of an elite command force under the Goa'uld Ishkar.
For years, they pillaged and plundered under his name.
Driving fear into the hearts of all those who would oppose his fear.
The further they ascended among the ranks, the more they were able to discern the truth.
That he was not a God at all, but merely an imposter.
Our true God's are those that came before us.
You're talking about the Ancients.
Ishkar branded my ancestors as traitors and ordered their deaths.
They tried to fight to show their brothers their faith.
But the odds were too great.
They were forced to flee, but they set out to find Keb, hoping that their souls would find peace.
But instead their search led them to this world.
You knew about the Goa'uld, but you didn't help the other Jaffa defeat them.
Look, for the first time in their history, the Jaffa are free.
But it won't last without strong leadership.
They need your help.
Their fate is of no concern to us.
I hope you are prepared to die well, Mitchell.
You will not be able to break your bonds.
We sought out the Sodan in peace.
We wished only to open dialogue.
Instead you attacked us and took our comrade.
All enemies who our transgress our sacred ground, sacrifice their lives.
Yeah well, you might want to post a few signs.
Look, we just want our friend back.
We figured that your fellow warrior's may wanna know that you're still alive and kicking, so we're thinking straight swap.
Our guy in exchange for you.
If your friend was taken, then mourn him.
For if he is not yet dead, he soon will be.
Hear me when I say that all free Jaffa have always had the greatest respect for the warriors of Sodan.
You speak of respect, yet you condemn me.
Without my symbiote, I will be dead soon enough!
A medicine called tretonin, courses through your veins.
You have been freed from your burden.
Such a thing is not possible.
OH, but it is.
It is very real, I assure you.
It is now used by several thousand free Jaffa, with no ill effects.
Your poison's will not work.
Had you any honour, you would have let me die on the battlefield.
So is it you just don't know what's going on in the rest of the galaxy or you really don't care?
The Jaffa made their choice 5000 years ago.
Their affairs are no concern to us.
Yeah, but how do you survive?
At some point you gotta go hunting for.....you know.
We raid Goa'uld strongholds for shipments of symbiotes that have yet to be implanted in any Jaffa.
Such missions are rites of passage for our youngest warriors.
Well it sounds like fun.
The fighting style of Sodan has been a closely guarded secret for a hundred generations.
It is a shame you will die shortly after learning it.
Attack me.
You find me an unworthy opponent?
No, it's just I don't feel like...
Ok, let's try that one more time.
You are slow and undisciplined.
If you fought your opponent today, you would die without landing a single blow.
And what happens if I refuse to fight?
You just kill me?
It is an alternative you do not wish to explore.
Dr Lam tells me you have refused to eat.
The very odour of your food, turns my stomach.
If you are to survive without your symbiote, you require sustenance.
It is only because your drug has weakened me.
On the contrary brother, it has freed you.
What do you know of freedom, hmmm?
You who have served false God's.
Who chooses to live in this squalor, rather than among his own people.
I know that I have heard stories of the Sodan, since I was but a child.
Your bravery and skill are legend among all Jaffa.
It is because of my failure as a warrior that I languish here now.
Prisoner to a former slave and his pitiful allies.
Speak not of skill to me.
Many Jaffa have fought and died for a cause that was started by the warriors of the Sodan!
And for what?
Instead of respecting the traditions of OUR ancestors, you would only seek to lead them further astray!
That way.
Blue is left.
Red is right.
Got it!
- Faster!
- Faster!
How did I do?
Badly.
Again!
Yeah, yeah.
You stop using that gadget, I guarantee you, I'll be better.
A Sodan warrior must anticipate attack at any moment.
Yeah well, where'd you guy's get those things, anyway?
The writings of our God's instructed us how to construct many of their devices.
We use them to protect our sacred grounds.
Speaking of God's, I know this is probably taboo, but I need to talk to your boss.
That visitor you had yesterday.
I'm assuming it's not the first time he's been here.
I've met their kind before.
They're bad news.
Look, I'll do any crazy, training exercise you want within reason.
Finish the course in time and I'll consider it.
You know, a bag of sand is not an accurate timing device.
You are an evil man!
Please, sit.
I'm good.....
Ok.
Maybe I will sit.
You know, I'm starting to get an idea of why you guy's attacked us.
That Prior's telling you we're enemies.
Is he wrong?
You could have cut us down the second we stepped through the gate, but you didn't.
Generations of my people fought and died under exile.
Praying for the day when we could seek the path without recrimination.
When we pray to the God's.
Do they hear us, Mitchell?
Do they once give us a sign as proof of their existence.
I know that the Ori are not the Ancients.
But can there be any doubt that they are Gods?
And if they can lead us to the path of enlightenment, how can I refuse them?
You're making a big mistake.
These Ori are not what you think they are.
They are not even close.
Ta'kel'syn!
Perhaps, when you finish your debt.
In your final moments, you'll understand.
Already been there.
I understand.
- You may rest now.
- No, I'm good, let's keep going.
You are not tired?
Six weeks Air Force training at Fort Benning, that's tiring.
This is nothing.
Come on!
I'm gonna survive this Kel'shak'lo thing, I'm gonna need a hell of a lot more than you're teaching me.
Quit pussy footing around and stop holding back.
Let's go!
You believe this staff is what makes you strong.
The Kran'too is nothing but an extension of your body.
No true warrior depends on a weapon for strength or advantage.
See, that's what I'm talking about!
Drink.
I'm not gonna get used to this stuff.
Were it not for my tea's, you would have died many day's ago.
It was self defence, you know.
The Jaffa I killed.
It was him or me.
It does not matter.
Blood has been spilled.
Our laws decree you must answer for it.
So who was it?
His name was Volnek.
A most skilled warrior.
Look, for what it's worth?
There's nothing I can say, is there?
No.
So, who do I fight?
Lord Haikon will determine that on the eve of the battle.
Usually it is the closest blood kin to the slain warrior.
Right.
And the next of kin is just as tough as he was.
Do I stand a chance?
Never mind.
I promise I'll die well and all that jazz.
But before I kick it, I gotta ask.
You buying what these Prior's are selling?
Lord Haikon has led us for more than a hundred years.
He knows what is best for us all.
Yeah, yea, look, I get it, you are a team player.
I'm asking you, what do you think?
It is not my place to question Haikon's judgement.
Nor is it yours!
Well somebody better, because if you guy's follow the Ori, All of your traditions, your Kran'too staff's, your precious path, your tasty beverages, it's all going down the drain!
Enough!
We're finished for the day.
You say a Prior has come to the Sodan and you have decided to follow the word of the Ori.
I walk the path of our true God's...
The Ori are not God's!
What did the Ori promise you?
A place of honour at his side.
As heralds for your new masters.
This Prior will have you hunt down and kill all Jaffa who refuse to follow the path of Origin.
That is the path you walk.
I will learn the codes of the Ancient transporter.
No matter how long it takes.
This is going nowhere.
Two weeks and he hasn't so much as given us a decent high coo.
Well, it's understandable, sir.
Most Jaffa would never break under normal interrogation techniques.
Not to mention the fact that the Sodan are an elite group of warriors.
I'm sure their minds are trained to withstand a lot worse.
What about the device?
We haven't made much progress, I'm afraid.
It seem's the code preventing us using it, is rigged to some sort of defence mechanism.
Dr Lee received a few nasty volts, while trying to implemet an override.
How is he?
Dr Lam say's the feelings should return to his legs in a few day's.
Meanwhile, the international committee is keeping score of all the resources we're using to try to find Mitchell.
Science teams, orbital scans by Prometheus.
All of them coming up empty certainly doesn't look good.
Another few day's and they'll tell us to shut down search and rescue operations.
Shut it down.
Sir, with all due respect, in the past we have spent months searching for our people in the field.
We can't just stop looking.
What she's saying sir is, we've never left a man behind.
I'm more than familiar with the concept, Dr Jackson.
Give me something I can use...soon, or the next paperwork I fill out will declare Mitchell, MIA.
I just need a minute!
Let him pass!
Thankyou.
Alright, I'll make this quick.
The Prior represents a race of Ancients, yes!
But believe me when I tell you, they are not the Ancients you wanna worship.
The Prior has healed our sick.
Caused our crops to grow as if by magic.
Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?
Look, their power is not what you should question.
It's how they use it!
Anyone refuses to worship them and they die.
And I'm not talking about a few non believer's here and there.
I'm talking about whole planet's wiped out!
And I should simply take your word for this?
You wanna believe my people are Godless and inferior?
Go right ahead.
But we have never needed proof our of God's existence in order to believe in them.
Faith.
It was your faith that sustained you for 5000 years, not the Ancients themselves.
Don't throw your history away for a bag full of magic tricks.
Admit it!
Haikon has totally lost his mind.
A warrior cannot talk and fight at the same time.
A fact you refuse to accept.
Got it.
You may provide a challenge to your opponent after all, Mitchell.
Followed by my violent death of course.
Of course.
To my inevitable demise!
Why do you do this?
Do what?
Train this hard.
These are the last day's of your life.
I would think you would spend more time in reflection.
Hell, all I know is, the moment you accept your fate, that's when you're as good as dead.
Till then, all bet's are off.
You cannot survive Kel'shak'lo!
Well no offence, but I've endured things I wasn't supposed to of survived before and I'm still here.
How can you be certain the Prior speaks falsely?
Because I've seen entire planet's wiped out because they refused to follow the Ori.
Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to think, but if everything I believed was being threatened.
I'd wanna know.
Jolan, your people shouldn't suffer for their faith.
You two, again.
Yes.
Us two, again.
Save your words, I amm not in the mood.
We know how you feel, but we're not here to talk.
They require evidence that the Ori are not to be trusted.
This is Tasan.
One of the founders on a free Jaffa settlement on a planet called Sarvarus.
Many families came to live there to enjoy the freedom that they'd fought so hard to achieve.
He is Sodan?
Indeed.
Tell him what happened.
A month ago, a man came through the Chaapa'ai.
He called himself a Prior.
He told us of powerful Gods called the Ori, ...who he claimed would give us protection and show us the path to enlightenment.
Then he left.
He later returned.
Told us we had to make a choice.
Follow the Ori or be destroyed.
We chose to resist.
Continue brother.
He dialed the Chaapa'ai and merely placed his staff in the ground in front of it.
Then the Earth shook with a fierceness I have never seen nor heard of before.
In moments, our city was levelled.
Hundreds of our people wiped out in an instant.
Enough of these lies!
You expect me to take the word of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa?
I witnessed the destruction with my own eyes!
Heed my words brother.
If a Prior visits your world, leave.
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior!
Human!
Do you deny it?
No, but it wasn't...
No, I don't deny it.
If any blood kin of the warrior seek recompense.
Let them step forward, now!
I seek it.
You.
In the name of Volnek of Gashrail, my brother.
May the blood spilled here today, settle this debt once and for all.
You may begin!
May you die well.
Likewise.
The human is dead!
The blood of the Sodan has been avenged.
He fought and died a warrior, my Lord.
It is only fitting he be given the rite of Shel'mak'asah.
Very well.
With your permission my Lord, I would like to take care of it myself.
I was afraid you would not wake.
Well maybe I shouldn't have.
How long was I ...
Seven hours.
Seven?
I thought it was only supposed to be two?
I may have inadvertantly made the elixer to strong.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, that's gonna leave a scar.
So, did it work?
The elixer was most effective.
They believe you are dead.
Well done, Bones.
Never mind.
So, where does this leave you?
If the Prior intends to mislead the Sodan as you say?
Then I am his enemy.
And Haikon?
It may be too late to convince him of his mistake.
But there are several other warriors who feel as I do.
We will continue to walk the path of the Sodan, until the others see the error of their ways.
Well, for what it's worth, you won't walk alone.
Come!
- How did it go?
- Not well.
Even after we showed him video footage of the damage, ...Volnek still refuses to believe the Ori are responsible for what happened on Sarvarus.
What's he doing now?
Nothing.
He hasn't said a word since Tasan left.
- Which put's us back to square one.
- Yeah basically.
- Teal'c seems to think that showing him more images...
- Unscheduled offworld activation!
What have we got, Chief?
Recieving an IDC sir.
It's Colonel Mitchell.
You're kidding?
I would never do that, sir.
You have a visitor.
You!
Yeah, I thought you were dead, too.
Oh, we have unfinished business!
Just take it easy.
- You shot me!
- You shot me first!
I will have vengeance!
You will listen, brother.
I know that you think we're enemies and right now it doesn't matter if we become allies.
What matters is that you understand the truth.
You are fortunate my brother drugged you.
You would never have survived a true Kel'shak'lo.
Don't know.
Took you down pretty good.
You were lucky.
Lucky is good.
Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.
We will meet again.
Looking forward to it.
What you got?
- Jaffa?
- Quiet!
It is nothing.
He's not doing that on purpose is he?
You know, just to keep me interested?
Well that depends.
Are you losing interest?
No!
We haven't found so much as a snapped twig on this planet, but hey, hey, it's all good, baby.
Teal'c's intel did suggest that the Sodan were rumoured to have a base of operations here.

Well we've found some pretty interesting things based on vague.
Yeah.
Still, I'm getting that grasping at straws feeling.
Yeah, just don't tell Teal'c.
I already did.
Yeah, what did he say?
"The warriors of the Sodan exist, Colonel Mitchell!
I am certain of it."
Needs more bass.
Go!
Fall back to the gate, I got our six.
Go, go, go!
Where the hell are they?
SG-22, this is SG-1.
We are under attack!
We need backup!
Where the hell is Mitchell?
Cameron, what's your position?
Cameron, do you copy?
His wound is grave my Lord.
His symbiote is badly damaged.
No!
Bring him!

He'll be dead by sunset.
If not sooner.
Then... you must keep him alive.
Carter to SGC.
You got anything yet, Chief?
Colonel, we're reading UAV telemetry, five by five.
So far, no sign of Colonel Mitchell.
Let me know when you've completed your first sweep.
Affirmative.
SGC out.
- Anything?
- Not yet.
How's he doing?
Not well.
His symbiote is dying.
If it is not removed, the host will die also.
Sergent, radio Dr Lam.
Let her know we have a priority one medical emergency incoming.
No tattoo.
He is a warrior of the Sodan.
According to legend, no Sodan has been indentured to the Goa'uld for over 5000 years.
So your intel was correct.
Indeed.
Colonel Carter.
There's something you need to see.
- This writing.
- Ancient.
Look familiar?
Nope.
Teal'c?
I have never before seen such a device.
Well, I'm detecting energy readings.
It's definitely some form of technology.
Perhaps this is how the Sodan managed to escape so quickly.
Actually, that's exactly what it is.
This says it's some sort of aperture or gateway to...
- To where?
- Enlightenment.
Just enlightenment?
Nothing more specific?
That's all it says.
Hold still!
You know, your bedside manner totally blows.
Your wound is infected.
It must be cleansed, or you will die.
This... will cause you a fair amount... of pain.
How's it going in there?
Touch and go.
They've been at it for nearly six hours now.
Most Jaffa would not survive such wounds.
Wich means she's very good.
That's why she's here.
Looks like you were both right about the device he was wearing.
More Ancient technology.
A cloak of invisibility.
That explains how they were able to ambush you so easily.
What about the transporter?
Carter's with a team on the planet, working on it right now.
So far they haven't been able to even open up the damn thing.
Let alone turn it on.
Yeah, sorry I couldn't have been more help.
Well one line of Ancient text isn't a hell of a lot to go on.
We're running surface scans with Prometheus on several moons and other planets in the system.
You believe Colonel Mitchell is no longer on P9G-844?
It's a possibility.
Ground sweeps and UAV scans are all coming up empty.
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.
You call to the others and it's goodbye, Jaffa.
It would seem you have me at a disadvantage.
It certainly appears that way.
Now, you're gonna tell me how I get...
How things seem and how they truly are, are two very different things.
For example.
You are free to leave this place whenever you choose.
What, now you're telling me?
But to reach the Chaapa'ai, would take months on foot to the mountains of Dor'ta'nak.
No one who's attempted the journey has ever survived.
- So how did we get...
- We were brought here through the eye of the Gods.
- Which is?
- Your questions can wait!
Now that your strength has returned, we should begin Joma'Sha'Tal'ac immediately.
If that's breakfast, I could eat.
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior.
Did you think our mercy was without purpose?
Lord Haikon has decreed that you will answer for your crimes by way of Kel Shak Lo.
Which you will battle with another warrior.
And on that day, you will die.
I take it from all the beeping, our friend is still with us.
That he is.
Though how he survived is a mystery to me.
I'd say that nine hours you spent working on him might have something to do with it.
Nice work.
I did what I could to save him, but his symbiote was too badly damaged.
We had no choice but to remove it and start him on tretonin.
As soon as he regains consciousness, I wanna know.
Why?
So you can interrogate him?
Well that might be more up Teal'c's alibi, but that's the idea.
Well it wasn't exactly the kind of post op recovery I had in mind.
Well let me know the moment he wakes up.
OK.
Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell,
United States Air Force.
Earth.
I don't know if you know what's been going on out there, but things are a little different now.
The Goa'uld have been defeated.
The Goa'uld should have been defeated five thousand years ago.
My ancestors were one of the first of the Sodan.
They were part of an elite command force under the Goa'uld Ishkur.
For years, they pillaged and plundered under his name.
Driving fear into the hearts of all those that would oppose his rule.
The further they ascended among the ranks, the more they were able to discern the truth.
That he was not a God at all, but merely an imposter.
Our true Gods are those that came before us.
You're talking about the Ancients.
Ishkur branded my ancestors as traitors and ordered their deaths.
They tried to fight to show their brothers their faith.
But the odds were too great.
They were forced to flee, they set out to find Kheb, hoping that their souls would find peace.
But instead their search led them to this world.
You knew about the Goa'uld, but you didn't help the other Jaffa defeat them.
Look, for the first time in their history, the Jaffa are free.
But it won't last without strong leadership.
They need your help.
Their fate is of no concern to us.
I hope you are prepared to die well, Mitchell.
You will not be able to break your bonds.
We sought out the Sodan in peace.
Wishing only to open dialogue.
Instead you attacked us and took our comrade.
All enemies who our transgress our sacred ground, forfeit their lives.
Yeah well, you might want to post a few signs.
Look, we just want our friend back.
We figured that your fellow warriors may wanna know that you're still alive and kicking, so we're thinking straight swap.
Our guy in exchange for you.
If your friend was taken, then mourn him.
For if he is not yet dead, he soon will be.
Hear me when I say that all free Jaffa have always had the greatest respect for the warriors of the Sodan.
You speak of respect, yet you condemn me.
Without my symbiote, I will be dead soon enough!
A medicine called tretonin, courses through your veins.
You have been freed from your burden.
Such a thing is not possible.
Oh, but it is.
It is very real, I assure you.
It is now used by several thousand free Jaffa, with no ill effects.
Your poisons will not work.
Had you any honour, you would have let me die on the battlefield.
So is it you just don't know what's going on in the rest of the galaxy or you really don't care?
The Jaffa made their choice 5000 years ago.
Their affairs are no concern to us.
Yeah, but how do you survive?
At some point you gotta go hunting for...you know.
We raid Goa'uld strongholds for shipments of symbiotes that have yet to be implanted in any Jaffa.
Such missions are rites of passage for our youngest warriors.
Well it sounds like fun.
The fighting style of Sodan has been a closely guarded secret for a hundred generations.
It is a shame you will die shortly after learning it.
Attack me.
You find me an unworthy opponent?
No, it's just I don't feel like...
OK.
Let's try that one more time.
You are slow and undisciplined.
If you fought your opponent today, you would die without landing a single blow.
And what happens if I refuse to fight?
You just kill me?
It is an alternative you do not wish to explore.
Dr Lam tells me you have refused to eat.
The very odour of your food turns my stomach.
If you are to survive without your symbiote, you require sustenance.
It is only because your drug has weakened me.
On the contrary brother, it has freed you.
What do you know of freedom?
You, who have served false Gods.
Who chooses to live in this squalor, rather than among his own people.
I know that I have heard stories of the Sodan, since I was but a child.
Your bravery and skill are legend among all Jaffa.
It is because of my failure as a warrior that I languish here now.
Prisoner to a former slave and his pitiful allies.
Speak not of skill to me.
Many Jaffa have fought and died for a cause that was started by the warriors of the Sodan!
And for what?
Instead of respecting the traditions of OUR ancestors, you would only seek to lead them further astray!
That way.
Blue is left.
Red is right.
Got it!
- Faster!
- Faster.
How did I do?
Badly.
Again!
Yeah, yeah.
You stop using that gadget, I guarantee you, I'll be better.
A Sodan warrior must anticipate an attack at any moment.
Yeah well, where'd you guys get those things, anyway?
The writings of our Gods instructed us how to construct many of their devices.
We use them to protect our sacred ground.
Speaking of Gods, I know this is probably taboo, but I need to talk to your boss.
That visitor you had yesterday.
I'm assuming it's not the first time he's been here.
I've met their kind before.
They're bad news.
Look, I'll do any crazy, training exercise you want... within reason.
Finish the course in time and I'll consider it.
You know, a bag of sand with a hole in it is not an accurate timing device.
You are an evil man!
Please, sit.
I'm good...
OK.
Maybe I will sit.
You know, I'm starting to get an idea of why you guys attacked us.
That Prior is telling you we're enemies.
Is he wrong?
You could have cut us down the second we stepped through the gate, but you didn't.
Generations of my people fought and died under exile.
Praying for the day when we could seek the path without recrimination.
When we pray to the Gods, do they hear us, Mitchell?
Do they once give us a sign as proof of their existence?
I know that the Ori are not the Ancients.
But can there be any doubt that they are Gods?
And if they can lead us to the path of enlightenment, how can I refuse them?
You're making a big mistake.
These Ori are not what you think they are.
They are not even close.
Tek'Hel'Shee!
Perhaps, when you finish your debt.
In your final moments, you'll understand.
I've already been there.
I understand.
You may rest now.
No, I'm good, let's keep going.
You are not tired?
Six weeks airborne training at Fort Benning, that's tiring.
This is nothing.
Come on!
If I wanna survive this Kel Shak Lo thing, I'm gonna need a hell of a lot more than you're teaching me.
Quit pussy footing around and stop holding back.
Let's go!
You believe this staff is what makes you strong.
The Kran'too is nothing but an extension of your body.
No true warrior depends on a weapon for strength or advantage.
See, that's what I'm talking about!
Drink.
I'm not gonna get used to this stuff.
Were it not for my teas, you would have died many days ago.
It was self defence, you know.
The Jaffa I killed.
It was him or me.
It does not matter.
Blood has been spilled.
Our laws decree you must answer for it.
So who was he?
His name was Volnek.
A most skilled warrior.
Look, for what it's worth?
There's nothing I can say, is there?
No.
So, who do I fight?
Lord Haikon will determine that on the eve of your battle.
Usually it is the closest blood kin to the slain warrior.
Right.
And the next of kin is just as tough as he was.
Do I stand a chance?
Never mind.
I promise I'll die well and all that jazz.
But before I kick it, I gotta ask.
You buying what these Priors are selling?
Lord Haikon has led us for more than a hundred years.
He knows what is best for us all.
Yeah, yeah, look, I get it, you are a team player.
I'm asking, what do you think?
It is not my place to question Haikon's judgement.
Nor is it yours!
Well somebody better, because if you guys follow the Ori, all of your traditions, your Kran'too staffs, your precious path, your tasty beverages, it's all going down the drain!
Enough!
We're finished for the day.
You say a Prior has come to the Sodan and you have decided to follow the word of the Ori.
- I walk the path of our true Gods...
- The Ori are not Gods!
What did the Prior promise you?
A place of honour at his side.
As heralds for your new masters.
This Prior will have you hunt down and kill all Jaffa who refuse to follow the path of Origin.
That is the path you walk.
I will learn the codes of the Ancient transporter.
No matter how long it takes.
This is going nowhere.
Two weeks and he hasn't given us so much as a decent high coo.
Well, it's understandable, Sir.
Most Jaffa would never break under normal interrogation techniques.
Not to mention the fact that the Sodan are an elite group of warriors.
I'm sure their minds are trained to withstand a lot worse.
What about the device?
We haven't made much progress, I'm afraid.
It seems the code preventing us using it, is rigged to some sort of defence mechanism.
Dr Lee received a few nasty volts, while trying to implement an override.
How is he?
Dr Lam says the feelings should return to his legs in a few days.
Meanwhile, the international committee is keeping score of all the resources we're using to try to find Mitchell.
Science teams, orbital scans by Prometheus.
All of them coming up empty certainly doesn't look good.
Another few days and they'll tell us to shut down search and rescue operations.
Shut it down?
Sir, with all due respect, in the past we have spent months searching for our people in the field.
We can't just stop looking.
What she's saying sir, is we've never left a man behind.
I'm more than familiar with the concept, Dr Jackson.
Give me something I can use, soon.
Or the next paperwork I fill out will declare Mitchell MIA.
I just need a minute!
Let him pass.
Thank you.
Alright, I'll make this quick.
The Prior represents a race of Ancients, yes!
But believe me when I tell you, they are not the Ancients you wanna worship.
The Prior has healed our sick.
Caused our crops to grow as if by magic.
Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?
Look, their power is not what you should question.
It's how they use it!
Anyone refuses to worship them and they die.
And I'm not talking about a few non believers here and there.
I'm talking about whole planets wiped out!
And I should simply take your word for this?
You wanna believe my people are godless and inferior?
Go right ahead.
But we have never needed proof of our Gods' existence in order to believe in them.
Faith.
It was your faith that sustained you for five thousand years, not the Ancients themselves.
Don't throw your history away for a bag full of magic tricks.
Admit it!
Haikon has totally lost his mind.
A warrior cannot talk and fight at the same time.
A fact you refuse to accept.
Got it.
You may provide a challenge to your opponent after all, Mitchell.
Followed by my violent death of course.
Of course.
To my inevitable demise!
Why do you do this?
Do what?
Train this hard.
These are the last days of your life.
I would think you would spend more time in reflexion.
Well all I know is, the moment you accept your fate, that's when you're as good as dead.
Till then, all bets are off.
You cannot survive Kel Shak Lo.
Well no offence, but
I've endured things I wasn't supposed to survive before and
I'm still here.
How can you be certain the Prior speaks falsely?
Because...
I've seen entire planets wiped out because they refused to follow the Ori.
Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to think, but if everything I believed was being threatened,
I'd wanna know.
Jolan, your people shouldn't suffer for their faith.
You two, again.
Yes.
Us two, again.
Save your words, I am not in the mood.
We know how you feel, but we're not here to talk.
You require evidence that the Ori are not to be trusted.
This is Tass'an.
One of the founders of a free Jaffa settlement on a planet called Sarvarus.
Many families came to live there to enjoy the freedom that they fought so hard to achieve.
He is Sodan?
Indeed.
Tell him what happened.
A month ago, a man came through the Chaapa'ai.
He called himself a Prior.
He told us of powerful Gods called the Ori, who he claimed would give us protection and show us the path to enlightenment.
And he left.
He later returned.
Told us we had to make a choice.
Follow the Ori... or be destroyed.
We chose to resist.
Continue, brother.
He dialed the Chaapa'ai and merely placed his staff in the ground in front of it.
Then earth shook with a fierceness I have never seen nor heard of before.
In moments, our city was levelled.
Hundreds of our people wiped out in an instant.
Enough of these lies.
You expect me to take the word of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa?
I witnessed the destruction with my own eyes!
Heed my words, brother.
If a Prior visits your world, leave.
You have spilled the blood of a Sodan warrior!
Human, do you deny it?
No, but it wasn't...
No, I don't deny it.
If any blood kin of the warrior seek recompense, let him step forward, now!
I seek it.
You?
In the name of Volnek of Gashrail, my brother.
May the blood spilled here today, settle this debt once and for all.
You may begin!
May you die well.
Likewise.
The human is dead!
The blood of the Sodan has been avenged.
He fought and died a warrior, my Lord.
It is only fitting he be given the rite of Shel'mak'asah.
Very well.
With your permission my Lord, I would like to take care of it myself.
I was afraid you would not wake.
Well maybe I shouldn't have.
- How long was I...
- Seven hours.
Seven?
I thought it was only supposed to be two?
I may have inadvertently made the elixir to strong.
Yeah, that's gonna leave a scar.
So, did it work?
The elixir was most effective.
They believe you are dead.
Well done, Bones.
Never mind.
So, where does this leave you?
If the Prior intends to mislead the Sodan as you say, then I am his enemy.
And Haikon?
It may be too late to convince him of his mistake.
But there are several other warriors who feel as I do.
We will continue to walk the path of the Sodan, until the others see the error of their ways.
Well, for what it's worth, you won't walk alone.
Come!
How did it go?
Not well.
Even after we showed him video footage of the damage,
Volnek still refuses to believe the Ori are responsible for what happened on Sarvarus.
What's he doing now?
Nothing.
He hasn't said a word since Tass'an left.
Which puts us back to square one.
Yeah basically.
- Teal'c seems to think that showing him more images...
- Unscheduled offworld activation!
What have we got, Chief?
Recieving an IDC Sir.
It's Colonel Mitchell.
You're kidding?
I would never do that, Sir.
You have a visitor.
You!
Yeah, I thought you were dead, too.
Oh, we have unfinished business!
Just take it easy.
You shot me!
You shot me first!
I will have vengeance!
You will listen, brother.
I know that you think we're enemies and right now it doesn't matter if we become allies.
What matters is that you understand the truth.
You are fortunate my brother drugged you.
You would never have survived a true Kel Shak Lo.
Don't know.
Took you down pretty good.
You were lucky.
Lucky is good.
Granting my freedom changes nothing, Mitchell.
We will meet again.
Looking forward to it.
This can't be the right address.
I just saw somebody walk in.
Oh, and look...
What about the cops ?
What about them ?
- Is this where the break-in club is ?
- This is gonna be great !
I fronted your album.
That means I pick where you play.
And I collect the cover.
I don't need you anymore.
Even found my own place.
You don't get to freelance.
I still own you.
Sorry.
I can't hear you.
You will.
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?
Hey, will you relax ?
Three dead.
15 injured.
Who chose the location for the party, John ?
Nobody.
At least nobody who's admitting to it.
Ah, so we have a break-in party.
It's the latest thing.
Clubs don't want young hip-hop DJs playing.
- Too many fights.
- Yep.
So a bunch of "independent promoters" filled the void.
Break into a space.
Call it a club.
No permits.
No red tape.
Plenty of enemies, though.
Kids here say this DJ was getting big.
Thought he didn't need his promoter anymore.
Maybe his promoter felt otherwise.
What do you see ?
See this blast pattern, John ?
It means the explosion came from in there.
Be right back.
Hey, Alexx.
Horatio ?
What is it ?
I found the seat of detonation and something else.
Another victim of the blast.
Or the cause of it.
Hey.
Thanks for the heads-up.
I owe you one.
You would have found out yourself.
Maybe.
But I was here before the other news crews even got a whiff of it, thanks to you.
Make it up to me sometime when we're both not crazed.
Ah.
So never.
Tell me what you told the officer.
I was just talking to these two girls.
Then he showed up... and that's the last thing I remember.
Witnesses say you got into it with the DJ.
I just came here to talk to him.
That's all.
Talk or threaten ?
Depends on how well he listened.
Look, man, I almost got killed, too.
Yeah, but you didn't and he did.
And you have no smoke or debris on you.
What are you trying to say ?
Maybe you were on your way out because you knew about the bomb.
- Horatio ?
- Yeah ?
You need to see this.
You can go.
You stay.
What'd you get ?
No person set off the bomb.
This did.
It's a mercury switch.
All it takes is a strong vibration to activate it.
Liquid metal touches solid metal.... ...and good night.
That means the detonation was an accident.
It was the music that set it off.
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?
!
But if you use a mercury switch, why have an altimeter switch ?
He was still experimenting.
This was his workshop.
The question becomes Ryan, who was this bomb meant for ?
Found several of these pieces lodged in his back.
Melted plastic.
With some kind of wire inside.
Yes, it's a frag from the blast.
I gonna need to take a look at that.
But that's not the best part.
A stab wound.
Probably from a knife.
Definitely before the explosion.
And the reason the bomber didn't stop the bomb.
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?
!
Did they recover a knife ?
Not yet.
Calleigh.
Maybe he left it at she scene.
That's huge.
Yeah, I'll certainly look for it.
Something's missing.
Did you see anyone ?
Calleigh, what are you talking about ?
There's nobody out here.
You wouldn't hold a gun to my head, would you ?
There's no one out here.
Tox report on our bomber.
Potassium iodide levels are off the charts.
Now, normally, that means trouble with the thyroid.
Our guy was healthy.
Potassium iodide can be used to counteract radioactivity.
That's why I'm here in person.
A bomber who was preparing to be in contact with radioactive material.
We're talking about a dirty bomb.
Okay, I need to contact HazMat immediately.
Exposure to radiation leads to cancer... birth defects.
Horatio... if I need to get my kids out of town, you'll tell me, right ?
As soon as I know, you'll know, all right ?
Thank you.
Mr. Wolfe, were you at Trace ?
Explosives used in the bombings was TNT.
Used to disperse radiation.
Right.
So I talked to the military police at every base in South Florida.
We get anybody ?
Yeah and he's waiting for you at MDPD.
Nice going, Mr. Wolfe.
Thank you.
Your TNT got three people killed yesterday, Staff Sergeant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You work the bomb range.
- That's right.
- Tuesdays, you demo TNT.
That's right.
Nobody used the range this week.
So I have my days mixed up.
Or maybe you sold the explosives to cover your gambling debt.
On Tuesday, you deposited $40,000 into this account.
And on Wednesday, you wire-transferred it to a bookie in Costa Rica.
If this is about military ordnance, why am I talking to a civilian ?
Because civilians got killed.
So did the man who bought the explosives.
He was stabbed.
I don't know anything about a stabbing.
I took his money.
I gave him his three cases.
That's it.
Here's the bottom line, Sergeant:
your gambling problem got three people killed.
Get him out of here.
Three cases.
What's up ?
Three cases of TNT would've done a lot more damage than what we saw, right ?
So there's more out there ?
And it's connected to whoever stabbed the bomber.
Did we get anything off the knife ?
DNA got the blood.
Checking to see if it matches our vic.
What about prints, Eric ?
Well, most of the time, fire destroys them.
But, uh conditions are right, it can actually help.
The heat bakes the print right in place.
"Not authorized?"
I'm gonna go check with Admin.
This must be a glitch.
Agent Park.
That was quick.
Your little fingerprint search ?
- Rattled nerves all the way to DC.
- What do you want ?
Do you have any idea how delicate this operation is ?
We're looking for a handful of guys.
One misstep, one hint we're onto them, and they go back down the rabbit hole.
Come to the point, please.
Raymond was great at selling local.
He infiltrated a half-dozen narco operations, mostly Colombian.
Then he stumbled onto something bigger.
Someone, Agent, was selling drugs to fund terrorism.
We had no idea where the money was going,
- or what it was being used for.
- I can tell you.
They're making dirty bombs.
Your brother missed his check-in call.
As of 0900 today, he's in the wind.
So that's why you're here.
Thought he might contact you.
Doubt he trusted anyone else.
How can I help ?
Your brother's in danger, Horatio.
Who put him there ?
- Where the hell are you going to ?
- To clean up your mess.
Twice in one day.
What, are you stalking me now ?
No.
In your dreams.
Any leads yet on the Design District explosion ?
Nothing I can tell you.
Uh, I got to go back with something.
Come on, Ryan, anything.
I got nothing to give you.
I got to get back to the lab.
I got to work up a tox panel on this morning's vic.
Oh, chemistry.
Sexy.
I happen to think potassium iodine testing is very sexy.
So, if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry, boss.
I was just getting to that.
This my plastic frag ?
Yes, sir.
From the dead bomber's back.
Okay.
An LED.
Light-emitting diode.
Like inside your TV.
Electric current causes a discharge of photons.
Take a look at this.
Some kind of built-in motion sensor.
Keeps the LED completely self-contained.
Not a component of the bomb, but at the seat of detonation.
I've seen these before.
Club Freeze.
They make a heck of a martini.
John, Club Freeze.
Thank you.
You remember Matt Young.
We picked him up at Club Freeze.
Yes, you were at our crime scene this morning.
The break-in party ?
Yeah, you know that.
But first you were next door, weren't you ?
Sounds like a party.
Go check it out.
So what ?
Look what I found on him.
A .38.
I'm not breaking any laws.
No, but that doesn't mean you're not involved in that.
Would you empty the contents of your pockets, please ?
That.
Potassium iodide.
I got a thyroid problem.
Yes, just like your friend Brandon Miller.
We autopsied him.
Wait inside with the officer.
Everything okay ?
I wish people would stop asking me that.
Calleigh, you had a gun pointed at your head.
You'd be pissed if people weren't asking.
I need to figure out who was at the crime scene.
They saw me notice the void.
So there's a good chance they took the evidence.
The void looks like it's about three by four inches.
Have you, uh, tried the booking photos ?
I never saw him.
So how are you gonna make an ID ?
One click at a time.
Too soft.
It was more crisp than that.
Too hollow.
There were more clicks.
There was more of a slapping sound.
Wait.
Do that again.
That's it.
It's a Ruger.
GP-100.
Ruger's a rarer gun.
Has a transfer bar sort of rattles around when it's cocked.
Okay.
So we got the gun.
How do we get the gunman ?
I'm gonna run it through the Automated Firearms System.
What do you think the chances are of the gun being registered ?
Slim to none.
But it's what I've got.
You've got quite an interesting story there, Mr. Young.
Well, I'm happy to entertain.
You come from a good family.
They sent you to the best schools.
And yet you dropped out.
Why did you do that, Matt ?
I had my reasons.
And you travel.
I understand you spent quite a bit of time outside the country.
Where'd you go ?
Here, there.
I want to cut to the chase.
You were at the warehouse with Brandon testing bombs, weren't you ?
I don't know anything about bombs.
Do you have a grudge against this country ?
America's not a country, Lieutenant.
It's a corporation.
It starts wars for profit, sacrifices people for the bottom line.
And you intend to bankrupt that corporation.
That's quite an accusation.
Well, you've got quite a plan, don't you ?
Pretty lady.
Uh, what's her name ?
Detective Salas, right ?
In my opinion, she should have taken her husband's name, you know ?
Same as the son.
- Yelina ?
- What's up ?
Where's the boy.
Where's Ray, Junior ?
- Right now ?
- Yeah.
- At my mom's.
Why ?
- Okay.
Call her, please.
She said he never showed up.
Okay.
Where else could he be ?
Soccer practice has been over for two hours.
All right,
Horatio, what is going on ?
Ray is out there, and there are people after him.
They may be after you and the boy, too.
I'm going after him.
- I want you to stay...
- No, I am not staying here.
My son is in danger.
And I am not going to go into hiding.
Could make matters worse.
I'll find him.
- Raymond ?
- Horatio, you're the only one I can trust.
Hang on.
John.
Thought you'd want to know, that Matt Young character gave our guys the slip.
You get his address ?
I'm headed there now.
Second and Flagler.
Okay, I'll meet you there.
We can't talk here, Raymond.
How does a man allow his wife and son to believe he's dead, Raymond ?
When he's got no other choice, Horatio.
I begged you not to work Narcotics, didn't I ?
Feds had me dirty on tape.
They made me an ultimatum.
Let's see, how does it work ?
You fake your own death, you join them, and you avoid prosecution.
It's not...
They embedded me in a drug ring that was doing a lot more than dealing.
That's exactly right, Raymond.
They're making dirty bombs.
Big brother still knows more than me.
Tell me why you killed the bomber.
Because he made me.
And I was worried he was going to go after my family.
I'm not telling you squat.
You ask too many questions.
I'm just trying to get it right.
I know that you're a cop, and that you got a kid.
So you're not gonna mess up everything we've worked for.
Neither are you.
Well, it didn't work 'cause they have Ray, Junior.
What ?
Tell me about the bomb.
Uh, Ray Junior's all I care about right now.
Raymond, there's a way out of this, but you got to work with me.
Yeah, I'm listening.
Guy's name's Matt Young.
Moved out this afternoon.
I tried to give him his security deposit.
Wasn't interested.
Is this the guy ?
He's a meteorology student, I think.
Moved here from Salt Lake.
I got his license plate though.
We're going to need that.
Of course.
You can take what you want.
Then the rest is mine.
You got a deal.
Matt left in a hurry.
Yes, he did.
You got something ?
It's a soccer schedule.
Hey, Horatio, look at this.
It's numeric code.
Looks like minutes and seconds.
Could be a... could be a deadline.
So I got this license plate number for you.
Kid was renting a Cadillac Escalade.
Thank you.
Means he's got ONSTAR.
Means we've got a location.
John, I'm going to take it from here.
Ever since Ray died, you treat me like I don't know what I'm doing.
This is about to get messy.
You deserve to walk away clean.
So walk away.
Brother...
I'll never be clean.
Hey, John.
That's not true.
I'll see ya.
Yeah, this is Horatio Caine.
Listen, I have a vehicle description.
I need the ONSTAR coordinates.
Take me.
- Take me for the boy.
- Not going to happen.
Even trade, please.
Why don't you stand over here by him.
He's just a kid, man !
I don't care if he's just a kid.
Get down, Ray.
Down, son.
Okay, Ray.
Here we go.
Here's what I want you to do.
Right out there is the Hummer.
Run to the Hummer and don't look back.
Residents are fleeing greater Miami.
All the main roads are clogged.
Motorists are being asked to remain calm.
There have been reports of road rage and chaos among some motorists.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on ?
Check it out.
CBS 4 News has learned that Miami Dade police may have uncovered a plan to detonate radioactive dirty bombs in the city of Miami.
Sources close to the investigation have confirmed that one victim in last night's explosion may actually be tied to the terror plot.
Sources ?
Come on.
What sources ?
The victim had been taking potassium iodide-- a medication to stave off the effects of radiation poisoning.
How did they get the tox results ?
Had to be the ME's office.
They've got more leaks than the Titanic.
We'll stay on top of this breaking story with our exclusive updates.
Erica Sikes, CBS 4 News.
See that ?
That's why the city's in panic.
What I want to know-- I want to know how this got out.
Saw you talking to her.
All I told her was no comment.
Said a lot for no comment.
I didn't mean it.
Whether you meant it or not, you're the leak.
Interstate 95 is jammed out of the downtown area as well has Highway 836 due to heavy evacuation traffic.
We'll have more evacuation updates
Just put the evidence on my bench.
I'll sign for it later.
Calleigh.
Hi, John.
I was hoping we could talk.
What do you need ?
You're better with guns than I am.
It's my job.
It's why I became a criminalist.
You know why I became a cop ?
To help people.
Be someone's hero.
I think that's a good reason.
Yeah.
Only I haven't felt like one lately.
You've been through a lot, John.
You'll bounce back.
I feel like I'll never live down being the partner of a dirty cop.
People are going to forget.
I think about Ray all the time.
Every time I see Horatio.
Every time I come here.
Everybody knows that you're a great detective, John.
Do you ?
I know how hard you work.
I would really love to be friends with you, John.
The harshest thing a woman can say to a man.
Look, why don't I pack up the evidence and we'll go grab a cup of coffee in the break room.
I just need a minute.
She won't go.
She can't work it.
She knows that.
You try telling her, Eric.
Either way, I've got to get Hagen's body out.
All right.
Calleigh, I'm really sorry this happened here.
Why don't we go have a cup of coffee or something.
It should be my case.
You know it doesn't work like that.
You're a material witness.
Then put Camden on it from nights.
He's solid.
Okay.
Keep you informed every step.
Come on.
I've got 12 open cases.
I need to get back in there.
Wait.
Calleigh.
Honey, let him go.
There's something in his jacket.
It's our dead bomber.
Some sort of weather report.
Smoke-damaged.
It's what made the void.
John took it from the bomb scene.
I guess that's why he put the gun to my head.
He was afraid I'd see him.
That's crazy.
Why would Hagen take a piece of evidence from his own case ?
Because the right piece of evidence can make you a hero.
He just couldn't put it in context.
And he couldn't put it back.
I guess he felt like he'd run out of options.
It's a Skew T diagram.
Basically, today's weather forecast, indicating temperature, dew point and wind speed.
Wait a second.
Wind speed?
So they're planning to spread the radiation throughout a large area, aren't they?
We recovered an altimeter switch at the bomb scene.
And that means they're going to detonate at 800 feet in the air.
How are we going to determine where ?
Here's how.
Tyler, these numbers.
I found them in the bomber's apartment.
What do they mean ?
Latitude and longitude.
Maybe the location.
There you have it, Carrillo Park, right in the middle of downtown.
Tyler, what time are the perfect conditions for this ?
4:00 p.m.
What time is it now ?
3:45.
Hugh !
All clear.
Move the HazMat team now.
Hey.
I just spoke to my son.
Patrol's bringing him to me.
They used him to flush out his dad.
It worked.
And Raymond ?
It's just too much to process.
You know what ?
You...
You deserve some time off.
You deserve it as much as I do.
I agree.
- Brazil.
- Hum.
Do we still have time to pack ?
No.
Buy everything there.
Ready ?
Officers intercepted the suspect in downtown Miami.
The suspect was killed after he shot at the officers.
By acting fast, we were able to neutralize the threat before anyone was harmed.
What was your part in breaking the plot ?
Uh, I was just a cog in the wheel.
My coworkers saved countless lives today.
They're, huh...
They're amazing.
You're not coming.
You won't be alone.
Dad !
How?
Hey, Ray ?
You okay ?
You better disappear.
Somebody sees you, all bets are off.
Yeah.
It's the only way.
You could have told me.
There wasn't time.
Thank you.
You better go.
Okay ?
Now you take care.
All right.
I don't know what to say to him.
You'll think of something.
This can't be the right address.
I just saw somebody walk in.
Oh, and look...
What about the cops?
What about them?
- Is this where the break-in club is?
- This is gonna be great!
I fronted your album.
That means I pick where you play.
And I collect the cover.
I don't need you anymore.
Even found my own place.
You don't get to freelance.
I still own you.
Sorry.
I can't hear you.
You will.
Y'all ready to raise the roof?
Hey, will you relax?
Three dead.
15 injured.
Who chose the location for the party, John?
Nobody.
At least nobody who's admitting to it.
Ah, so we have a break-in party.
It's the latest thing.
Clubs don't want young hip-hop DJs playing.
- Too many fights.
- Yep.
So a bunch of "independent promoters" filled the void.
Break into a space.
Call it a club.
No permits.
No red tape.
Plenty of enemies, though.
Kids here say this DJ was getting big.
Thought he didn't need his promoter anymore.
Maybe his promoter felt otherwise.
What do you see?
See this blast pattern, John?
It means the explosion came from in there.
Be right back.
Hey, Alexx.
Horatio?
What is it?
I found the seat of detonation and something else.
Another victim of the blast.
Or the cause of it.

Hey.
Thanks for the heads-up.
I owe you one.
You would have found out yourself.
Maybe.
But I was here before the other news crews even got a whiff of it, thanks to you.
Make it up to me sometime when we're both not crazed.
Ah.
So never.
Tell me what you told the officer.
I was just talking to these two girls.
Then he showed up... and that's the last thing I remember.
Witnesses say you got into it with the DJ.
I just came here to talk to him.
That's all.
Talk or threaten?
Depends on how well he listened.
Look, man, I almost got killed, too.
Yeah, but you didn't and he did.
And you have no smoke or debris on you.
What are you trying to say?
Maybe you were on your way out because you knew about the bomb.
- Horatio?
- Yeah?
You need to see this.
You can go.
You stay.
What'd you get?
No person set off the bomb.
This did.
It's a mercury switch.
All it takes is a strong vibration to activate it.
Liquid metal touches solid metal and good night.
That means the detonation was an accident.
It was the music that set it off.
Y'all ready to raise the roof?
!
But if you use a mercury switch, why have an altimeter switch?
He was still experimenting.
This was his workshop.
The question becomes Ryan, who was this bomb meant for?
Found several of these pieces lodged in his back.
Melted plastic.
With some kind of wire inside.
Yes, it's a frag from the blast.
I gonna need to take a look at that.
But that's not the best part.
A stab wound.
Probably from a knife.
Definitely before the explosion.
And the reason the bomber didn't stop the bomb.
Y'all ready to raise the roof?
!
Did they recover a knife?
Not yet.
Calleigh.
Maybe he left it at she scene.
That's huge.
Yeah, I'll certainly look for it.
Something's missing.
Did you see anyone?
Calleigh, what are you talking about?
There's nobody out here.
You wouldn't hold a gun to my head, would you?
There's no one out here.
Tox report on our bomber.
Potassium iodide levels are off the charts.
Now, normally, that means trouble with the thyroid.
Our guy was healthy.
Potassium iodide can be used to counteract radioactivity.
That's why I'm here in person.
A bomber who was preparing to be in contact with radioactive material.
We're talking about a dirty bomb.
Okay, I need to contact HazMat immediately.
Exposure to radiation leads to cancer... birth defects.
Horatio... if I need to get my kids out of town, you'll tell me, right?
As soon as I know, you'll know, all right?
Thank you.
Mr. Wolfe, were you at Trace?
Explosives used in the bombings was TNT.
Used to disperse radiation.
Right.
So I talked to the military police at every base in South Florida.
We get anybody?
Yeah and he's waiting for you at MDPD.
Nice going, Mr. Wolfe.
Thank you.
Your TNT got three people killed yesterday, Staff Sergeant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You work the bomb range.
- That's right.
- Tuesdays, you demo TNT.
That's right.
Nobody used the range this week.
So I have my days mixed up.
Or maybe you sold the explosives to cover your gambling debt.
On Tuesday, you deposited $40,000 into this account.
And on Wednesday, you wire-transferred it to a bookie in Costa Rica.
If this is about military ordnance, why am I talking to a civilian?
Because civilians got killed.
So did the man who bought the explosives.
He was stabbed.
I don't know anything about a stabbing.
I took his money.
I gave him his three cases.
That's it.
Here's the bottom line, Sergeant:
your gambling problem got three people killed.
Get him out of here.
Three cases.
What's up?
Three cases of TNT would've done a lot more damage than what we saw, right?
So there's more out there?
And it's connected to whoever stabbed the bomber.
Did we get anything off the knife?
DNA got the blood.
Checking to see if it matches our vic.
What about prints, Eric?
Well, most of the time, fire destroys them.
But, uh conditions are right, it can actually help.
The heat bakes the print right in place.
"Not authorized?"
I'm gonna go check with Admin.
This must be a glitch.
Agent Park.
That was quick.
Your little fingerprint search?
- Rattled nerves all the way to DC.
- What do you want?
Do you have any idea how delicate this operation is?
We're looking for a handful of guys.
One misstep, one hint we're onto them, and they go back down the rabbit hole.
Come to the point, please.
Raymond was great at selling local.
He infiltrated a half-dozen narco operations, mostly Colombian.
Then he stumbled onto something bigger.
Someone, Agent, was selling drugs to fund terrorism.
We had no idea where the money was going,
- or what it was being used for.
- I can tell you.
They're making dirty bombs.
Your brother missed his check-in call.
As of 0900 today, he's in the wind.
So that's why you're here.
Thought he might contact you.
Doubt he trusted anyone else.
How can I help?
Your brother's in danger, Horatio.
Who put him there?
- Where the hell are you going to?
- To clean up your mess.
Twice in one day.
What, are you stalking me now?
No.
In your dreams.
Any leads yet on the Design District explosion?
Nothing I can tell you.
Uh, I got to go back with something.
Come on, Ryan, anything.
I got nothing to give you.
I got to get back to the lab.
I got to work up a tox panel on this morning's vic.
Oh, chemistry.
Sexy.
I happen to think potassium iodine testing is very sexy.
So, if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry, boss.
I was just getting to that.
This my plastic frag?
Yes, sir.
From the dead bomber's back.
Okay.
An LED.
Light-emitting diode.
Like inside your TV.
Electric current causes a discharge of photons.
Take a look at this.
Some kind of built-in motion sensor.
Keeps the LED completely self-contained.
Not a component of the bomb, but at the seat of detonation.
I've seen these before.
Club Freeze.
They make a heck of a martini.
John, Club Freeze.
Thank you.
You remember Matt Young.
We picked him up at Club Freeze.
Yes, you were at our crime scene this morning.
The break-in party?
Yeah, you know that.
But first you were next door, weren't you?
Sounds like a party.
Go check it out.
So what?
Look what I found on him.
A.38.
I'm not breaking any laws.
No, but that doesn't mean you're not involved in that.
Would you empty the contents of your pockets, please?
That.
Potassium iodide.
I got a thyroid problem.
Yes, just like your friend Brandon Miller.
We autopsied him.
Wait inside with the officer.
Everything okay?
I wish people would stop asking me that.
Calleigh, you had a gun pointed at your head.
You'd be pissed if people weren't asking.
I need to figure out who was at the crime scene.
They saw me notice the void.
So there's a good chance they took the evidence.
The void looks like it's about three by four inches.
Have you, uh, tried the booking photos?
I never saw him.
So how are you gonna make an ID?
One click at a time.
Too soft.
It was more crisp than that.
Too hollow.
There were more clicks.
There was more of a slapping sound.
Wait.
Do that again.
That's it.
It's a Ruger.
GP-100.
Ruger's a rarer gun.
Has a transfer bar sort of rattles around when it's cocked.
Okay.
So we got the gun.
How do we get the gunman?
I'm gonna run it through the Automated Firearms System.
What do you think the chances are of the gun being registered?
Slim to none.
But it's what I've got.
You've got quite an interesting story there, Mr. Young.
Well, I'm happy to entertain.
You come from a good family.
They sent you to the best schools.
And yet you dropped out.
Why did you do that, Matt?
I had my reasons.
And you travel.
I understand you spent quite a bit of time outside the country.
Where'd you go?
Here, there.
I want to cut to the chase.
You were at the warehouse with Brandon testing bombs, weren't you?
I don't know anything about bombs.
Do you have a grudge against this country?
America's not a country, Lieutenant.
It's a corporation.
It starts wars for profit, sacrifices people for the bottom line.
And you intend to bankrupt that corporation.
That's quite an accusation.
Well, you've got quite a plan, don't you?
Pretty lady.
Uh, what's her name?
Detective Salas, right?
In my opinion, she should have taken her husband's name, you know?
Same as the son.

- What's up?
Where's the boy.
Where's Ray, Junior?
- Right now?
- Yeah.
- At my mom's.
Why?
- Okay.
Call her, please.
She said he never showed up.
Okay.
Where else could he be?
Soccer practice has been over for two hours.

They made me an ultimatum.

Patrol's bringing him to me.
They used him to flush out his dad.
It worked.
And Raymond?
It's just too much to process.
You know what?
You...
You deserve some time off.
You deserve it as much as I do.
I agree.
- Brazil.
- Hum.
Do we still have time to pack?
No.
Buy everything there.
Ready?
Officers intercepted the suspect in downtown Miami.
The suspect was killed after he shot at the officers.
By acting fast, we were able to neutralize the threat before anyone was harmed.
What was your part in breaking the plot?
Uh, I was just a cog in the wheel.
My coworkers saved countless lives today.
They're, huh...
They're amazing.
You're not coming.
You won't be alone.
Dad!
How?
Hey, Ray?
You okay?
You better disappear.
Somebody sees you, all bets are off.
Yeah.
It's the only way.
You could have told me.
There wasn't time.
Thank you.
You better go.
Okay?
Now you take care.
All right.
I don't know what to say to him.
You'll think of something.
This can't be the right address.
I just saw somebody walk in.
Oh, and look...
What about the cops ?
What about them ?
- Is this where the break-in club is ?
- This is gonna be great !
I fronted your album.
That means I pick where you play.
And I collect the cover.
I don't need you anymore.
Even found my own place.
You don't get to freelance.
I still own you.
Sorry.
I can't hear you.
You will.
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?
Hey, will you relax ?
Three dead.
15 injured.
Who chose the location for the party, John ?
Nobody.
At least nobody who's admitting to it.
Ah, so we have a break-in party.
It's the latest thing.
Clubs don't want young hip-hop DJs playing.
- Too many fights.
- Yep.
So a bunch of "independent promoters" filled the void.
Break into a space.
Call it a club.
No permits.
No red tape.
Plenty of enemies, though.
Kids here say this DJ was getting big.
Thought he didn't need his promoter anymore.
Maybe his promoter felt otherwise.
What do you see ?
See this blast pattern, John ?
It means the explosion came from in there.
Be right back.
Hey, Alexx.
Horatio ?
What is it ?
I found the seat of detonation and something else.
Another victim of the blast.
Or the cause of it.

Hey.
Thanks for the heads-up.
I owe you one.
You would have found out yourself.
Maybe.
But I was here before the other news crews even got a whiff of it, thanks to you.
Make it up to me sometime when we're both not crazed.
Ah.
So never.
Tell me what you told the officer.
I was just talking to these two girls.
Then he showed up... and that's the last thing I remember.
Witnesses say you got into it with the DJ.
I just came here to talk to him.
That's all.
Talk or threaten ?
Depends on how well he listened.
Look, man, I almost got killed, too.
Yeah, but you didn't and he did.
And you have no smoke or debris on you.
What are you trying to say ?
Maybe you were on your way out because you knew about the bomb.
- Horatio ?
- Yeah ?
You need to see this.
You can go.
You stay.
What'd you get ?
No person set off the bomb.
This did.
It's a mercury switch.
All it takes is a strong vibration to activate it.
Liquid metal touches solid metal.... ...and good night.
That means the detonation was an accident.
It was the music that set it off.
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?
!
But if you use a mercury switch, why have an altimeter switch ?
He was still experimenting.
This was his workshop.
The question becomes Ryan, who was this bomb meant for ?
Found several of these pieces lodged in his back.
Melted plastic.
With some kind of wire inside.
Yes, it's a frag from the blast.
I gonna need to take a look at that.
But that's not the best part.
A stab wound.
Probably from a knife.
Definitely before the explosion.
And the reason the bomber didn't stop the bomb.
Y'all ready to raise the roof ?
!
Did they recover a knife ?
Not yet.
Calleigh.
Maybe he left it at she scene.
That's huge.
Yeah, I'll certainly look for it.
Something's missing.
Did you see anyone ?
Calleigh, what are you talking about ?
There's nobody out here.
You wouldn't hold a gun to my head, would you ?
There's no one out here.
Tox report on our bomber.
Potassium iodide levels are off the charts.
Now, normally, that means trouble with the thyroid.
Our guy was healthy.
Potassium iodide can be used to counteract radioactivity.
That's why I'm here in person.
A bomber who was preparing to be in contact with radioactive material.
We're talking about a dirty bomb.
Okay, I need to contact HazMat immediately.
Exposure to radiation leads to cancer... birth defects.
Horatio... if I need to get my kids out of town, you'll tell me, right ?
As soon as I know, you'll know, all right ?
Thank you.
Mr. Wolfe, were you at Trace ?
Explosives used in the bombings was TNT.
Used to disperse radiation.
Right.
So I talked to the military police at every base in South Florida.
We get anybody ?
Yeah and he's waiting for you at MDPD.
Nice going, Mr. Wolfe.
Thank you.
Your TNT got three people killed yesterday, Staff Sergeant.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You work the bomb range.
- That's right.
- Tuesdays, you demo TNT.
That's right.
Nobody used the range this week.
So I have my days mixed up.
Or maybe you sold the explosives to cover your gambling debt.
On Tuesday, you deposited $40,000 into this account.
And on Wednesday, you wire-transferred it to a bookie in Costa Rica.
If this is about military ordnance, why am I talking to a civilian ?
Because civilians got killed.
So did the man who bought the explosives.
He was stabbed.
I don't know anything about a stabbing.
I took his money.
I gave him his three cases.
That's it.
Here's the bottom line, Sergeant :
your gambling problem got three people killed.
Get him out of here.
Three cases.
What's up ?
Three cases of TNT would've done a lot more damage than what we saw, right ?
So there's more out there ?
And it's connected to whoever stabbed the bomber.
Did we get anything off the knife ?
DNA got the blood.
Checking to see if it matches our vic.
What about prints, Eric ?
Well, most of the time, fire destroys them.
But, uh conditions are right, it can actually help.
The heat bakes the print right in place.
"Not authorized ?"
I'm gonna go check with Admin.
This must be a glitch.
Agent Park.
That was quick.
Your little fingerprint search ?
- Rattled nerves all the way to DC.
- What do you want ?
Do you have any idea how delicate this operation is ?
We're looking for a handful of guys.
One misstep, one hint we're onto them, and they go back down the rabbit hole.
Come to the point, please.
Raymond was great at selling local.
He infiltrated a half-dozen narco operations, mostly Colombian.
Then he stumbled onto something bigger.
Someone, Agent, was selling drugs to fund terrorism.
We had no idea where the money was going,
- or what it was being used for.
- I can tell you.
They're making dirty bombs.
Your brother missed his check-in call.
As of 0900 today, he's in the wind.
So that's why you're here.
Thought he might contact you.
Doubt he trusted anyone else.
How can I help ?
Your brother's in danger, Horatio.
Who put him there ?
- Where the hell are you going to ?
- To clean up your mess.
Twice in one day.
What, are you stalking me now ?
No.
In your dreams.
Any leads yet on the Design District explosion ?
Nothing I can tell you.
Uh, I got to go back with something.
Come on, Ryan, anything.
I got nothing to give you.
I got to get back to the lab.
I got to work up a tox panel on this morning's vic.
Oh, chemistry.
Sexy.
I happen to think potassium iodine testing is very sexy.
So, if you'll excuse me.
I'm sorry, boss.
I was just getting to that.
This my plastic frag ?
Yes, sir.
From the dead bomber's back.
Okay.
An LED.
Light-emitting diode.
Like inside your TV.
Electric current causes a discharge of photons.
Take a look at this.
Some kind of built-in motion sensor.
Keeps the LED completely self-contained.
Not a component of the bomb, but at the seat of detonation.
I've seen these before.
Club Freeze.
They make a heck of a martini.
John, Club Freeze.
Thank you.
You remember Matt Young.
We picked him up at Club Freeze.
Yes, you were at our crime scene this morning.
The break-in party ?
Yeah, you know that.
But first you were next door, weren't you ?
Sounds like a party.
Go check it out.
So what ?
Look what I found on him.
A .38.
I'm not breaking any laws.
No, but that doesn't mean you're not involved in that.
Would you empty the contents of your pockets, please ?
That.
Potassium iodide.
I got a thyroid problem.
Yes, just like your friend Brandon Miller.
We autopsied him.
Wait inside with the officer.
Everything okay ?
I wish people would stop asking me that.
Calleigh, you had a gun pointed at your head.
You'd be pissed if people weren't asking.
I need to figure out who was at the crime scene.
They saw me notice the void.
So there's a good chance they took the evidence.
The void looks like it's about three by four inches.
Have you, uh, tried the booking photos ?
I never saw him.
So how are you gonna make an ID ?
One click at a time.
Too soft.
It was more crisp than that.
Too hollow.
There were more clicks.
There was more of a slapping sound.
Wait.
Do that again.
That's it.
It's a Ruger.
GP-100.
Ruger's a rarer gun.
Has a transfer bar sort of rattles around when it's cocked.
Okay.
So we got the gun.
How do we get the gunman ?
I'm gonna run it through the Automated Firearms System.
What do you think the chances are of the gun being registered ?
Slim to none.
But it's what I've got.
You've got quite an interesting story there, Mr. Young.
Well, I'm happy to entertain.
You come from a good family.
They sent you to the best schools.
And yet you dropped out.
Why did you do that, Matt ?
I had my reasons.
And you travel.
I understand you spent quite a bit of time outside the country.
Where'd you go ?
Here, there.
I want to cut to the chase.
You were at the warehouse with Brandon testing bombs, weren't you ?
I don't know anything about bombs.
Do you have a grudge against this country ?
America's not a country, Lieutenant.
It's a corporation.
It starts wars for profit, sacrifices people for the bottom line.
And you intend to bankrupt that corporation.
That's quite an accusation.
Well, you've got quite a plan, don't you ?
Pretty lady.
Uh, what's her name ?
Detective Salas, right ?
In my opinion, she should have taken her husband's name, you know ?
Same as the son.
- Yelina ?
- What's up ?
Where's the boy.
Where's Ray, Junior ?
- Right now ?
- Yeah.
- At my mom's.
Why ?
- Okay.
Call her, please.
She said he never showed up.
Okay.
Where else could he be ?
Soccer practice has been over for two hours.
All right,
Horatio, what is going on ?
Ray is out there, and there are people after him.
They may be after you and the boy, too.
I'm going after him.
- I want you to stay...
- No, I am not staying here.
My son is in danger.
And I am not going to go into hiding.
Could make matters worse.
I'll find him.
- Raymond ?
- Horatio, you're the only one I can trust.
Hang on.
John.
Thought you'd want to know, that Matt Young character gave our guys the slip.
You get his address ?
I'm headed there now.
Second and Flagler.
Okay, I'll meet you there.
We can't talk here, Raymond.
How does a man allow his wife and son to believe he's dead, Raymond ?
When he's got no other choice, Horatio.
I begged you not to work Narcotics, didn't I ?
Feds had me dirty on tape.
They made me an ultimatum.
Let's see, how does it work ?
You fake your own death, you join them, and you avoid prosecution.
It's not...
They embedded me in a drug ring that was doing a lot more than dealing.
That's exactly right, Raymond.
They're making dirty bombs.
Big brother still knows more than me.
Tell me why you killed the bomber.
Because he made me.
And I was worried he was going to go after my family.
I'm not telling you squat.
You ask too many questions.
I'm just trying to get it right.
I know that you're a cop, and that you got a kid.
So you're not gonna mess up everything we've worked for.
Neither are you.
Well, it didn't work 'cause they have Ray, Junior.
What ?
Tell me about the bomb.
Uh, Ray Junior's all I care about right now.
Raymond, there's a way out of this, but you got to work with me.
Yeah, I'm listening.
Guy's name's Matt Young.
Moved out this afternoon.
I tried to give him his security deposit.
Wasn't interested.
Is this the guy ?
He's a meteorology student, I think.
Moved here from Salt Lake.
I got his license plate though.
We're going to need that.
Of course.
You can take what you want.
Then the rest is mine.
You got a deal.
Matt left in a hurry.
Yes, he did.
You got something ?
It's a soccer schedule.
Hey, Horatio, look at this.
It's numeric code.
Looks like minutes and seconds.
Could be a... could be a deadline.
So I got this license plate number for you.
Kid was renting a Cadillac Escalade.
Thank you.
Means he's got ONSTAR.
Means we've got a location.
John, I'm going to take it from here.
Ever since Ray died, you treat me like I don't know what I'm doing.
This is about to get messy.
You deserve to walk away clean.
So walk away.
Brother...
I'll never be clean.
Hey, John.
That's not true.
I'll see ya.
Yeah, this is Horatio Caine.
Listen, I have a vehicle description.
I need the ONSTAR coordinates.
Take me.
- Take me for the boy.
- Not going to happen.
Even trade, please.
Why don't you stand over here by him.
He's just a kid, man !
I don't care if he's just a kid.
Get down, Ray.
Down, son.
Okay, Ray.
Here we go.
Here's what I want you to do.
Right out there is the Hummer.
Run to the Hummer and don't look back.
Residents are fleeing greater Miami.
All the main roads are clogged.
Motorists are being asked to remain calm.
There have been reports of road rage and chaos among some motorists.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on ?
Check it out.
CBS 4 News has learned that Miami Dade police may have uncovered a plan to detonate radioactive dirty bombs in the city of Miami.
Sources close to the investigation have confirmed that one victim in last night's explosion may actually be tied to the terror plot.
Sources ?
Come on.
What sources ?
The victim had been taking potassium iodide-- a medication to stave off the effects of radiation poisoning.
How did they get the tox results ?
Had to be the ME's office.
They've got more leaks than the Titanic.
We'll stay on top of this breaking story with our exclusive updates.
Erica Sikes, CBS 4 News.
See that ?
That's why the city's in panic.
What I want to know-- I want to know how this got out.
Saw you talking to her.
All I told her was no comment.
Said a lot for no comment.
I didn't mean it.
Whether you meant it or not, you're the leak.
Interstate 95 is jammed out of the downtown area as well has Highway 836 due to heavy evacuation traffic.
We'll have more evacuation updates
Just put the evidence on my bench.
I'll sign for it later.
Calleigh.
Hi, John.
I was hoping we could talk.
What do you need ?
You're better with guns than I am.
It's my job.
It's why I became a criminalist.
You know why I became a cop ?
To help people.
Be someone's hero.
I think that's a good reason.
Yeah.
Only I haven't felt like one lately.
You've been through a lot, John.
You'll bounce back.
I feel like I'll never live down being the partner of a dirty cop.
People are going to forget.
I think about Ray all the time.
Every time I see Horatio.
Every time I come here.
Everybody knows that you're a great detective, John.
Do you ?
I know how hard you work.
I would really love to be friends with you, John.
The harshest thing a woman can say to a man.
Look, why don't I pack up the evidence and we'll go grab a cup of coffee in the break room.
I just need a minute.
She won't go.
She can't work it.
She knows that.
You try telling her, Eric.
Either way, I've got to get Hagen's body out.
All right.
Calleigh, I'm really sorry this happened here.
Why don't we go have a cup of coffee or something.
It should be my case.
You know it doesn't work like that.
You're a material witness.
Then put Camden on it from nights.
He's solid.
Okay.
Keep you informed every step.
Come on.
I've got 12 open cases.
I need to get back in there.
Wait.
Calleigh.
Honey, let him go.
There's something in his jacket.
It's our dead bomber.
Some sort of weather report.
Smoke-damaged.
It's what made the void.
John took it from the bomb scene.
I guess that's why he put the gun to my head.
He was afraid I'd see him.
That's crazy.
Why would Hagen take a piece of evidence from his own case ?
Because the right piece of evidence can make you a hero.
He just couldn't put it in context.
And he couldn't put it back.
I guess he felt like he'd run out of options.
It's a Skew T diagram.
Basically, today's weather forecast, indicating temperature, dew point and wind speed.
Wait a second.
Wind speed?
So they're planning to spread the radiation throughout a large area, aren't they?
We recovered an altimeter switch at the bomb scene.
And that means they're going to detonate at 800 feet in the air.
How are we going to determine where ?
Here's how.
Tyler, these numbers.
I found them in the bomber's apartment.
What do they mean ?
Latitude and longitude.
Maybe the location.
There you have it, Carrillo Park, right in the middle of downtown.
Tyler, what time are the perfect conditions for this ?
4:00 p.m.
What time is it now ?
3:45.
Hugh !
All clear.
Move the HazMat team now.
Hey.
I just spoke to my son.
Patrol's bringing him to me.
They used him to flush out his dad.
It worked.
And Raymond ?
It's just too much to process.
You know what ?

Like inside your TV.
Electric current causes a discharge of photons.
Take a look at this.
Some kind of built-in motion sensor.
Keeps the LED completely self-contained.
Not a component of the bomb, but at the seat of detonation.
I've seen these before.
Club Freeze.
They make a heck of a martini.
John, Club Freeze.
Thank you.
You remember Matt Young.
We picked him up at Club Freeze.
Yes, you were at our crime scene this morning.
The break-in party ?
Yeah, you know that.
But first you were next door, weren't you ?
Sounds like a party.
Go check it out.
So what ?
Look what I found on him.
A .38.
I'm not breaking any laws.
No, but that doesn't mean you're not involved in that.
Would you empty the contents of your pockets, please ?
That.
Potassium iodide.
I got a thyroid problem.
Yes, just like your friend Brandon Miller.
We autopsied him.
Wait inside with the officer.
Everything okay ?
I wish people would stop asking me that.
Calleigh, you had a gun pointed at your head.
You'd be pissed if people weren't asking.
I need to figure out who was at the crime scene.
They saw me notice the void.
So there's a good chance they took the evidence.
The void looks like it's about three by four inches.
Have you, uh, tried the booking photos ?
I never saw him.
So how are you gonna make an ID ?
One click at a time.
Too soft.
It was more crisp than that.
Too hollow.
There were more clicks.
There was more of a slapping sound.
Wait.
Do that again.
That's it.
It's a Ruger.
GP-100.
Ruger's a rarer gun.
Has a transfer bar sort of rattles around when it's cocked.
Okay.
So we got the gun.
How do we get the gunman ?
I'm gonna run it through the Automated Firearms System.
What do you think the chances are of the gun being registered ?
Slim to none.
But it's what I've got.
You've got quite an interesting story there, Mr. Young.
Well, I'm happy to entertain.
You come from a good family.
They sent you to the best schools.
And yet you dropped out.
Why did you do that, Matt ?
I had my reasons.
And you travel.
I understand you spent quite a bit of time outside the country.
Where'd you go ?
Here, there.
I want to cut to the chase.
You were at the warehouse with Brandon testing bombs, weren't you ?
I don't know anything about bombs.
Do you have a grudge against this country ?
America's not a country, Lieutenant.
It's a corporation.
It starts wars for profit, sacrifices people for the bottom line.
And you intend to bankrupt that corporation.
That's quite an accusation.
Well, you've got quite a plan, don't you ?
Pretty lady.
Uh, what's her name ?
Detective Salas, right ?
In my opinion, she should have taken her husband's name, you know ?
Same as the son.
- Yelina ?
- What's up ?
Where's the boy.
Where's Ray, Junior ?
- Right now ?
- Yeah.
- At my mom's.
Why ?
- Okay.
Call her, please.
She said he never showed up.
Okay.
Where else could he be ?
Soccer practice has been over for two hours.
All right,
Horatio, what is going on ?
Ray is out there, and there are people after him.
They may be after you and the boy, too.
I'm going after him.
- I want you to stay...
- No, I am not staying here.
My son is in danger.
And I am not going to go into hiding.
Could make matters worse.
I'll find him.
- Raymond ?
- Horatio, you're the only one I can trust.
Hang on.
John.
Thought you'd want to know, that Matt Young character gave our guys the slip.
You get his address ?
I'm headed there now.
Second and Flagler.
Okay, I'll meet you there.
We can't talk here, Raymond.
How does a man allow his wife and son to believe he's dead, Raymond ?
When he's got no other choice, Horatio.
I begged you not to work Narcotics, didn't I ?
Feds had me dirty on tape.
They made me an ultimatum.
Let's see, how does it work ?
You fake your own death, you join them, and you avoid prosecution.
It's not...
They embedded me in a drug ring that was doing a lot more than dealing.
That's exactly right, Raymond.
They're making dirty bombs.
Big brother still knows more than me.
Tell me why you killed the bomber.
Because he made me.
And I was worried he was going to go after my family.
I'm not telling you squat.
You ask too many questions.
I'm just trying to get it right.
I know that you're a cop, and that you got a kid.
So you're not gonna mess up everything we've worked for.
Neither are you.
Well, it didn't work 'cause they have Ray, Junior.
What ?
Tell me about the bomb.
Uh, Ray Junior's all I care about right now.
Raymond, there's a way out of this, but you got to work with me.
Yeah, I'm listening.
Guy's name's Matt Young.
Moved out this afternoon.
I tried to give him his security deposit.
Wasn't interested.
Is this the guy ?
He's a meteorology student, I think.
Moved here from Salt Lake.
I got his license plate though.
We're going to need that.
Of course.
You can take what you want.
Then the rest is mine.
You got a deal.
Matt left in a hurry.
Yes, he did.
You got something ?
It's a soccer schedule.
Hey, Horatio, look at this.
It's numeric code.
Looks like minutes and seconds.
Could be a... could be a deadline.
So I got this license plate number for you.
Kid was renting a Cadillac Escalade.
Thank you.
Means he's got ONSTAR.
Means we've got a location.
John, I'm going to take it from here.
Ever since Ray died, you treat me like I don't know what I'm doing.
This is about to get messy.
You deserve to walk away clean.
So walk away.
Brother...
I'll never be clean.
Hey, John.
That's not true.
I'll see ya.
Yeah, this is Horatio Caine.
Listen, I have a vehicle description.
I need the ONSTAR coordinates.
Take me.
- Take me for the boy.
- Not going to happen.
Even trade, please.
Why don't you stand over here by him.
He's just a kid, man !
I don't care if he's just a kid.
Get down, Ray.
Down, son.
Okay, Ray.
Here we go.
Here's what I want you to do.
Right out there is the Hummer.
Run to the Hummer and don't look back.
Residents are fleeing greater Miami.
All the main roads are clogged.
Motorists are being asked to remain calm.
There have been reports of road rage and chaos among some motorists.
Hey.
Hey, what's going on ?
Check it out.
CBS 4 News has learned that Miami Dade police may have uncovered a plan to detonate radioactive dirty bombs in the city of Miami.
Sources close to the investigation have confirmed that one victim in last night's explosion may actually be tied to the terror plot.
Sources ?
Come on.
What sources ?
The victim had been taking potassium iodide-- a medication to stave off the effects of radiation poisoning.
How did they get the tox results ?
Had to be the ME's office.
They've got more leaks than the Titanic.
We'll stay on top of this breaking story with our exclusive updates.
Erica Sikes, CBS 4 News.
See that ?
That's why the city's in panic.
What I want to know-- I want to know how this got out.
Saw you talking to her.
All I told her was no comment.
Said a lot for no comment.
I didn't mean it.
Whether you meant it or not, you're the leak.
Interstate 95 is jammed out of the downtown area as well has Highway 836 due to heavy evacuation traffic.
We'll have more evacuation updates
Just put the evidence on my bench.
I'll sign for it later.
Calleigh.
Hi, John.
I was hoping we could talk.
What do you need ?
You're better with guns than I am.
It's my job.
It's why I became a criminalist.
You know why I became a cop ?
To help people.
Be someone's hero.
I think that's a good reason.
Yeah.
Only I haven't felt like one lately.
You've been through a lot, John.
You'll bounce back.
I feel like I'll never live down being the partner of a dirty cop.
People are going to forget.
I think about Ray all the time.
Every time I see Horatio.
Every time I come here.
Everybody knows that you're a great detective, John.
Do you ?
I know how hard you work.
I would really love to be friends with you, John.
The harshest thing a woman can say to a man.
Look, why don't I pack up the evidence and we'll go grab a cup of coffee in the break room.
I just need a minute.
She won't go.
She can't work it.
She knows that.
You try telling her, Eric.
Either way, I've got to get Hagen's body out.
All right.
Calleigh, I'm really sorry this happened here.
Why don't we go have a cup of coffee or something.
It should be my case.
You know it doesn't work like that.
You're a material witness.
Then put Camden on it from nights.
He's solid.
Okay.
Keep you informed every step.
Come on.
I've got 12 open cases.
I need to get back in there.
Wait.
Calleigh.
Honey, let him go.
There's something in his jacket.
It's our dead bomber.
Some sort of weather report.
Smoke-damaged.
It's what made the void.
John took it from the bomb scene.
I guess that's why he put the gun to my head.
He was afraid I'd see him.
That's crazy.
Why would Hagen take a piece of evidence from his own case ?
Because the right piece of evidence can make you a hero.
He just couldn't put it in context.
And he couldn't put it back.
I guess he felt like he'd run out of options.
It's a Skew T diagram.
Basically, today's weather forecast, indicating temperature, dew point and wind speed.
Wait a second.
Wind speed?
So they're planning to spread the radiation throughout a large area, aren't they?
We recovered an altimeter switch at the bomb scene.
And that means they're going to detonate at 800 feet in the air.
How are we going to determine where ?
Here's how.
Tyler, these numbers.
I found them in the bomber's apartment.
What do they mean ?
Latitude and longitude.
Maybe the location.
There you have it, Carrillo Park, right in the middle of downtown.
Tyler, what time are the perfect conditions for this ?
4:00 p.m.
What time is it now ?
3:45.
Hugh !
All clear.
Move the HazMat team now.
Hey.
I just spoke to my son.
Patrol's bringing him to me.
They used him to flush out his dad.
It worked.
And Raymond ?
It's just too much to process.
You know what ?
You...
You deserve some time off.
You deserve it as much as I do.
I agree.
- Brazil.
- Hum.
Do we still have time to pack ?
No.
Buy everything there.
Ready ?
Officers intercepted the suspect in downtown Miami.
The suspect was killed after he shot at the officers.
By acting fast, we were able to neutralize the threat before anyone was harmed.
What was your part in breaking the plot ?
Uh, I was just a cog in the wheel.
My coworkers saved countless lives today.
They're, huh...
They're amazing.
You're not coming.
You won't be alone.
Dad !
How ?
Hey, Ray ?
You okay ?
You better disappear.
Somebody sees you, all bets are off.
Yeah.
It's the only way.
You could have told me.
There wasn't time.
Thank you.
You better go.
Okay ?
Now you take care.
All right.
I don't know what to say to him.
You'll think of something.
BEYOND HATRED
It's a failure... of the society I live and am part of.
Because I am part of it.
What will life be like after that?
This story begins 730 days after the murder
Jean-Paul, I can't do it.
You can't?
Let's see.
I'll give it back after.
Because it's tiny.
It's really hard to hold.
It has to be snowwhite.
If not, it won't look good.
This bit goes better!
Didn't you notice that this bit fits better?
He didn't realize what was happening because they jumped out at him.
He must've trusted them, and tried to talk to them.
He told them right out he was gay, because they asked him.
After they threw him in the water they went after him again.
I've no idea why they went after him and started all over again.
Then I guess he said things, even if he was a bit groggy.
He must have been totally out of it.
This anger, this hate, it's...
I was quite capable of the same type of violence as those three, I think.
You have to live with that.
You discover another side to yourself.
He must've said something like this to them:
"Do you realize what you're doing?"
Or: "You bunch of assholes!" Something like that.
He must've said:
"Think what you're doing!"
Those three... are the last to see Francois alive...
It was just Francois' face.
That's a question... we'd like an answer to:
Why the face?
It's symbolic of something...
He was still wearing his pants.
His top had come off, but it was when they threw him in that it came off.
They didn't strip him naked.
It was just his face.
They took it out on his face.
And we don't why only the face.
- It's weird.
- It's a good question.
I didn't ask questions like that.
My fear in the car was that they would drag me out.
I thought, "Once I'm out it'll be worse."
Especially since no one was around.
There was no one to ask for help, no one who could call the police...
So I knew they could drag me out of the car.
I was terrified they'd drag me out.
I thought: "If they drag me out, anything can happen.
But in the end that didn't happen.
They just beat up the left side of his face.
Because it was the only side accessible to them.
For me, the physical pain wasn't the worst thing.
Even when they were hitting him, it wasn't like they were hurting him.
It was the surprise...
I just wasn't expecting it...
And the unrelenting fury.
And the insults I kept hearing...
"We hate fags!
We hate fags!"
Screaming it out...
It was pure hatred.
As the words left his mouth, it was like he was experiencing great relief in letting it all out.
That was the real pain I felt.
I need to talk.
I think it's the only way to free yourself of a certain number of things and finally get beyond hatred.
The hatred... on which you rebuild yourself.
Which is what you shouldn't do.
They went to Leo Lagrange Park...
- and I'll use their exact words -
"...to do some fag-bashing."
They hid in the bushes... and waited for their prey, dare I say.
In truth, they proffer the ideas of the far right.
That's very true.
But as far as we know, only X and Y carried cards for the National Republican Movement.
We're not sure about the others.
Maybe they hadn't paid their subs.
We didn't pay them as much attention as we would their financial backers.
- They must have put up posters.
- That's probably right.
They also have The Oak magazine delivered.
The National Republican Movement monthly review.
At one point, one of them said:
"Freminet was found guilty and sentenced
"because Le Pen exploits people.
Whereas..."
- What's the other one called?
- Megret.
"...
Megret's a lot better."
But they really belong to the skinhead movement.
I don't think that betrays what's in the dossier:
They're skinheads.
Their rallies:
The skinhead movement.
Their camps:
The skinhead movement.
Sure, it's all based on the ideas of the far right.
Though they do drink a lot of beer at those rallies.
They sing songs praising Hitler.
Those that family X were singing in the garage.
People in Bazencourt said the doors were wide open and they heard Hitler songs and marching.
Will we ever find out...
- this has always haunted me - ...at exactly what time it happened?
There's a time window, but...
I'd have to look into it more deeply.
We know what time they arrived...
And when they got to the caf, .
We know at about what time Francois left the bar and what bar he was in.
We can get a rough idea of how much time it took him to get from the bar to...
I know he'd been drinking beer so I don't know...
- He might've stopped off on the way.
- For a smoke.
There are also the photos the jury will see.
That we haven't seen.
And never will see.
If you want to see them I'll show you.
- Later.
- Yes.
It won't help right now.
I agree it won't really help, but at the same time, we can only... imagine what...
You know what I mean.
Marie-Cecile, I have a file that contains...
I know.
...black and white photos.
If ever you want to see them, tell me.
I'm not here to add to your grief.
For sure.
I know that your intentions are good, but...
I'm not keeping you from them.
Photos apart, I've shown you everything else, right?
Yes, of course you have.
The day you first called me and I saw the message saying it was very urgent,
I thought: "If Marie-Cecile calls and says it's very urgent,
"it must be serious." But I never thought it was that.
My worry then was to find out if you knew Francois was a homosexual.
I did.
Because he could easily have kept it a secret.
Since he wasn't obliged to tell you.
I thought it was great that he had told you.
Because if he hadn't done it or had put off doing it, it would have been even worse for you as you'd have had the impression he was hiding something.
But it's usual for kids to hide parts of their lives.
And a good job too!
He was of adult age, so I guess it was normal he told you.
But it is quite a big thing, which is why I was concerned when you called...
I think I asked you almost immediately.
Because I felt it would have made the whole thing even worse for you.
It will also be interesting to see How those who aren't on trial, not because they didn't do anything, but how they've changed in 2 years.
Because they haven't been in prison.
So I wonder what they feel now about the crime.
I'm thinking of Aurelie's statement during the investigation, which was quite mind-blowing.
- She supported them.
- Yes...
She supported their ideas.
And she admitted to taking part in their expeditions.
That she'd been with them...
Without actually joining in.
But she knew what was happening.
Did the investigators try...
Could Aurelie's statement have any bearing?
To show that the hatred and the insults he incurred harmed him more than the physical beating.
For me, it wasn't a discovery, but it was something concrete.
Because in the end, what does the beating itself really matter?
Nothing at all.
It's not anything concrete.
No, it's not concrete.
But people do realize...
I'm not sure that they do.
Francois' murder took a very long time.
I find it extremely long for a victim.
The attack came in two phases.
We know from their own statements that it came in two waves.
They think they have the right to kill, an Arab or a homosexual without being...
I guess they hoped they'd never be caught.
We had no idea what the reason was.
My first reaction was:
"What was he doing there?"
We knew he was in Rheims, but...
Then the newspaper articles started suggesting things...
We had no idea at all.
We were completely bemused.
How many years could they get?
- I don't know.
- You don't?
I don't know.
I can tell you the maximum, but it depends.
Will the minor try to present himself as a poor boy under the...
Of course he was under the influence of Fabien.
That's an evidence.
Plus he lived in that environment.
So you wonder how he came to...
Anyway, he's not exactly smart, let's be honest.
So as a teenager, all he had to identify with... and base himself on was that environment.
That's true, we can't go against that.
The father said he knew nothing, but at the second interview he admitted to starting to burn the ID papers in a saucepan, but as it began to smell...
- maybe they were plastic-coated - he burned the rest in the garden.
As for the mother, she admitted that...
Franck gave her the cell-phone.
It's crazy how many cell-phones these people have!
Franck brings home cell-phones, no one cares...
She knew all about their expeditions.
They knew they went out in Rheims and they knew they weren't going out in Rheims to see a movie or a concert.
The parents completely messed up...
How do you feel about all this?
It's like our family has exploded.
We used to be very united...
Sure there were things that never got said, but...
My brothers and sisters and I no longer have the same relationship.
Why not?
I think it's a way for us to protect ourselves.
Sure, Francois was the eldest, but he had his own life.
Yeah, right...
It won't be easy.
I said it won't be easy.
- It never is.
- No...
Francois sent... sent me 2 text messages on the Friday evening to tell me he was at the bar.
A bar I'd told him about in July.
I knew he'd gone for a few days to Rheims.
On the Saturday, his boyfriend called me...
He was worried Francois hadn't called and couldn't be reached.
I told him not to worry... thinking that perhaps Francois just needed some space.
To get away from us all and have 3 days to himself.
I did try to call but got his voicemail.
I left a message.
The day went by... the Sunday.
Still no news of Francois.
I was really worried, but I thought, "Well, he's living his life."
I knew he was due back on Monday evening.
Early evening or a bit later.
On Tuesday morning before leaving for work,
Mika called to say Francois hadn't come home.
Then I got really worried as there was no news at all.
When I got to work and had a chance to read the newspaper...
- the first page, at least -
I saw the article... in L'Ardennais...
A young man had been found... in a park... but hadn't been identified.
About 30...
So I called the SRPJ (the Regional Crime Squad)
To make sure it wasn't Francois.
Then I went up to Rheims... knowing it was him, but... not wanting to believe it, hoping it was some else... right till the end.
Throughout the one-hour trip to Rheims,
I was saying: "Please call me.
Please don't let it be him...
"Too bad for the other guy."
It's dreadful to think that.
I reached the SRPJ at 1 p.m.
And...
I must've spent... two and a half hours talking about Francois with the lieutenant, without knowing...
Actually, I did know, but...
I wasn't 100% certain.
Because when I got to the SRPJ I showed them his photos right away.
And anyway, the captain had already told me over the phone that he was very sorry, but... there was a big chance it was Francois.
So when I showed them the photos...
I knew... somehow I knew.
I saw it in their faces.
At 3.30 p.m. They showed me his rings.
A little later, his photo taken after they had pulled him from the water.
A photo that looked nothing like him.
I didn't recognize him, only his hair extension.
All that was identifiable was his hair extension.
Then we went to the morgue.
I think it did me good to see him... like that, asleep... well, at rest.
At peace.
That evening, his body was sent to Paris for the autopsy.
And I had to tell my parents.
The hardest moment of the day, really.
I drove a knife into my parents when I told them... their eldest son was dead.
The only thing that seemed a bit weird was you asking us to sit down.
And Dad didn't want to.
He said: "Go on, spit it out!"
Very hard, very dry...
Right off, I kept thinking How I'd tell you.
There aren't exactly 50 thousand ways of expressing it.
And when I said it, when I said Francois had passed on...
No, you said: "Francois is dead."
I did.
And then...
I remember asking you:
"Where, when and how?" I asked you like that.
And in a tone...
like you were about to jump down my throat.
Funny, huh?
That really sticks in my mind.
It's not that I was scared you'd jump down my throat, but of a mother's reaction...
A bit like a she-wolf, you know.
- And Dad...
- I was in his arms.
You broke down.
And Dad...
The memory I have of Dad...
- and this is just an image, right - is of him going... like a massive weight on his shoulders.
You were both in each other's arms and then you realized I was still there.
Because you were over there, leaning against the bread-bin, on the other side of the room.
It's like there was a kind of time warp.
And then came the precisions.
Over the next few days, it was funny because...
I've always put myself in your shoes, to try to understand why you both reacted how you did when people asked you things.
What do you mean, "how we reacted"?
Not letting us go out.
I thought to myself: "If I had a daughter maybe I'd be the same."
That's how we saw things...
That's the only time in my life I could put myself in your shoes.
- But you couldn't.
- And I didn't want to.
You hadn't had your own son Louis yet, so you couldn't.
The reaction of our friends' mothers and of your friends who are mothers was exactly the same.
It was so obvious because...
- What reaction?
- A gut reaction.
Everyone reacted with their guts.
All those women reacted with...
Because a lot of them phoned, and they all reacted with their mother's instinct.
All having the same reaction is kind of...
The way I see it, the death of a child... is beyond all logic, we gave it life...
Remember what you said when you sat down that night?
You said... not to me but to Dad, and it seemed odd because you said:
"What's the point of all this?" While looking at your tummy, and I imagined you remembering the birth...
I don't remember doing that.
And it questioned everything.
If he blows his top you're better off not being around.
It's his nerves.
Once he's got something into his head, that's it.
I told them right out:
"You'll be discovered.
"It'll all come out and you'll be discovered."
And I was right.
And now it's going round and round... thinking about it again and again.
I was in the kitchen when they came back.
Then Franck or one of the others came over and said:
"We beat up a guy."
I said: "I hope you haven't..."
Sometimes I sit there staring at something for 10 minutes...
I just stare...
See my car?
I could stare at that for 10 minutes.
Just sitting there staring.
Going round and round.
Two days later, my wife was watching the news and that's when we heard the poor lad had died in Leo Lagrange Park.
So I said to the boys:
"You've been really stupid.
You'll pay for it now."
They went all white.
I said:
"You're in it big time, boys."
People think seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist is because you're crazy.
Untrue!
You say you're not nuts.
Of course you're not.
Psychologists aren't there to treat lunatics.
They're to help us with certain difficulties we have.
The proof I'm not crazy is all the dates I give you...
Not one person in this room thinks for one instant that you have a single grain of madness.
Even if you smoke 3 or 4 packs a day, drink 2 or 3 quarts of beer a day and sleep only 1 or 2 hours, it's due to high anxiety or problems that are buried, some deep maybe,
which can be sorted out by someone qualified to help you.
It's got absolutely nothing to do with madness!
There are some nights when I get through a quart of coffee.
There you go!
Incontestably they had extreme ideas and almost absolute intolerance.
And they had already made many, many advances to my client on this point.
I'm not saying this excessive intolerance will vanish.
2 years is short in a man's life, but they have made a lot of progress.
I won't discourage you, but I witnessed Michael Freminet's "change".
Freminet who was tried and sentenced for murdering Brahim Bouaram.
You're saying the exact same thing as his trial lawyer:
"He's changed a lot...
"He was only there because he was a poor misled lad..."
What happens?
He's released and returns to that ideology.
That's extremely discouraging for all the people, including me, who wanted him to change.
I don't know whether he's back into that ideology.
I don't know Freminet.
I've never been his lawyer and don't know his mind...
He nonetheless moved in your clients' circles.
He returned to that intellectually poor entourage.
He's a friend of the sister of one of the men I'm defending.
There's nothing in the files to suggest that the lad hasn't changed his ideas.
He wasn't found guilty, but of course we checked, because his name was there and we wondered about it.
We found he was having problems with those who are accused today since it seems...
- I'm not his lawyer - he no longer shares their ideas.
The civil parties want to know what exactly happened.
Whether it's finally legally qualified as homicide 1 or as homicide 2 isn't the question.
It's to know their loved-ones' final moments.
That's howl see the case.
So basically we'll be fighting over 15 different statements.
Find out the truth?
We're dealing with a milieu whose intellectual level is going to make it hard for us to get clear, coherent explanations.
We started off with homicide 1, which means:
Even before arriving in the park, they had premeditated to kill.
The charge was then changed to homicide 2.
The charge sheet says:
"Inquiries have established that the three men charged
"went to Leo Lagrange Park intending to commit violence
"and not to kill."
So legally speaking, the question is:
Before the park there had been no trouble, so...
They won't go back on that now.
They went to the park "intending to commit violence" and they did.
So we're still on the same track.
I'll ask if, between the time of the beating and the time they took the body over the bridge, if they had discussed it.
And one of them said in his statement:
"We didn't talk, we used eye-contact."
That's fundamental, because there wasn't common premeditation.
That supports the theory that they lost control, then panicked and found a solution to get rid of the victim's body.
Right, because this morning Michael told me, when I asked why they carried the body to the bridge:
"We were convinced he was dead,
"and we didn't want to leave the body on the path
"where someone could find it and we'd be arrested right away."
So they went to the trouble to hide what they thought was a dead body.
If we approach it as a form of pure violence and not an act of homophobia,
I don't think the civil parties will agree to it.
It's not a homophobia trial.
It's a gang of skinheads, who are by nature homophobic, who killed a homosexual man.
But it's not the primary characteristic of Francois Chenu, despite where he was found.
They hate homosexuals, they hate Arabs, they hate Jews, they hate Blacks, they hate socialists, they hate communists...
Don't forget gypsies.
My first question to my client was:
"Who's left?
Not many people."
Only them.
These guys are living in a void, because they have no family or friends.
And then they create a world with no people in it.
Except their violent buddies.
The children are coming.
One of them went up to him.
I don't know what he said but I suppose he asked if he was gay.
Francois wouldn't hide it, he'd have admitted it.
And that would have bothered them.
It must have made them mad.
There and back, you crossed this park, where 3 young men lay in wait behind some bushes to "do" a gay, having failed to "do" an Arab.
You crossed their path.
It could have been anyone else.
The hatred of others left you no chance.
Today, after our anger and our heartbreak, our wounds are still open.
But we want your death to help us all reflect.
You were happy to live.
You were easy to get on with.
Your artistic streak and sensitivity made you appear fragile.
But you were strong in beliefs and in friendship.
You couldn't conceive of intolerance, despite not being a militant.
You ask us now to look at ourselves to change our rapport with others.
We wish to participate in this everyday fight to increase tolerance and with it the respect of difference without which society would collapse.
It's unacceptable that political movements use youngsters, through their simplistic slogans designating as scapegoats Jews, Arabs and homosexuals, provoking hatred and justifying violence.
It's also unacceptable that our indifference and prejudice become bedfellows with intolerance, thus preventing escape from victimization and supporting communitarianism.
Each of us must question the way we look at all other people to increase tolerance and decrease violence.
We are with you on this Friday September 10, members of your family and friends, in Leo Lagrange Park for this moment of contemplation.
Francois, we are proud of you.
I'm a Radio-France reporter.
Can I ask you some questions?
- We'd rather not.
- Not before the trial.
We don't any publicity.
But afterwards, you can contact our lawyer.
We do everything through her.
We'll meet after.
- OK.
You'll be at the trial?
- Yes.
- Then I'll see you there.
- But it's in camera.
I know, but the press will be there.
- Yes, of course.
- We were told that.
But we don't want to talk about the trial.
I understand.
And I really respect your decision.
I remember Mom saying to me:
"I know you saw him, but are you sure it was him?"
You never give up hoping.
Even though I saw his body, I never gave up hope.
I don't really want to see them or enter their world.
They caused chaos in our lives.
We never asked them for anything.
They destroyed the life of six people.
They killed Francois and destroyed us five.
So I still don't feel like coming face to face with them.
Perhaps I have a fear... of having to live with certain feelings once I've actually met them.
You're always afraid of the unknown.
But once you know something, you can handle the fear.
The trial will be a reference for their whole lives, not just for what they did that September 13.
So I'll have to be aware and stay aware of all that.
But there will be a certain number of people there and that will necessarily force me to change.
I didn't feel like changing.
I'd like to have retained my anger for ever.
But I do realize that whatever happens... change will be a necessity and I'll have to see them differently.
What do you expect from next week's trial?
A kind of relief?
It will be an important step in my grieving process.
We've been waiting for this for two years, so it will be important to us, because we didn't see Francois.
And that's very hard to live with.
We expect a judgment, but no more than a judgment of fellowmen.
They must be tried and judged for what they did, and that's that.
Plus we'll see them and they'll see us...
"Calling".
Hello?
Is it working?
This is Monique Derrien in Rheims.
Seems to be working Great!
This is a 40-second spot on the trial of three skinheads in Rheims.
I don't know how I'm doing for time.
I don't have a watch.
If I was too long, take out the last sentence.
3 young men with haggard eyes, not daring to look at the victim's family.
A factory packer, a soldier, a high-school student.
That's all we learned today of the 3 accused who attacked Francois Chenu for being homosexual.
Beaten and thrown in the pond of Leo Lagrange Park, Rheims, he died of drowning.
The trial will be in camera, because the youngest was then under 16.
No good!
I should've said "was then 16".
The trial will be in camera, because the youngest was then 16.
His parents will also appear for destroying evidence.
They're free and are known for their racist and xenophobic leanings.
One of their daughters was the then girlfriend of Michael Freminet, known for pushing a Moroccan in the River Seine during a National Front march on May 1, 1995.
A racist murder that saw him sentenced to 8 years in jail.
Is the hardest thing thinking that as he resisted he suffered?
I'm proud of him.
I'm proud he resisted until the end.
He was passing through there...
Wrong place, wrong time, that's all.
Hello.
Can I ask your role in this trial?
Sister of the victim.
What do you expect from the trial?
Not much.
Just that they're tried for their deeds.
Was it because of the fact that your brother was homosexual?
What happened exactly?
I'm sorry, but we have work to do.
I think it was especially hard for Francois' family this afternoon.
It was hard because they heard from the mouths of the accused what exactly they did.
They know the facts since they're familiar with the case.
But it's different hearing it from the horse's mouth...
- and I'm not here to reproach them even more - not coldly, but with a calm that sends shivers down your spine.
So in that respect, it's hard for them.
They told the story, but they had already admitted it.
They told what we already knew.
But it's true that with time, we might have expected some feelings about what they had done.
Like I said, it wasn't cold, but there was a distance that made it seem very cold.
Was their cowardice in their fury?
For sure.
Three against one defenseless person the unrelenting beating to the face, leaving him, as far as they knew, for dead...
The forensics experts who appeared this afternoon told us that what really killed Francois Chenu was that fact that they threw his body into the water.
He drowned to death.
And the poignant remark made by the experts today was:
If they had left him on the path he'd still be alive today.
They couldn't stand the fact that he continued to resist.
That's when something clicked in their heads.
They thought: "With all we've just done, he's still going.
"Doesn't he realize we're stronger?
Then we'll show him!"
That was the path of violence.
That's what they couldn't stand.
It's they who give the lessons.
We'll ask only questions we have answers to.
It's hard to take in.
I know they wouldn't own up to it, but still...
If it had been me instead of Francois Chenu,
I'd have done the same thing, till my dying breath.
I'd have spoken out.
You can't admit, however bad the violence, that numbers or strength stand for what's right.
I think that went right over their heads.
It wasn't in their code.
It was a very courageous act.
There's always one individual to be saved in a group, when you manage to break his behavioral reflexes and modes and we find real psychological answers and make Michael see that the real world is not how he saw it
when he was with his skinhead pals.
That can make sense to him as an individual, as a human.
That's what we must do to bring him back into the fold.
Total familial incompetence.
Their families are totally inexistent.
Parents who accept their children being skinheads and taking over the family home is too much.
As both the defense and the prosecution tried to get them to say during their examinations.
It's more than just tolerance.
It becomes support at that level.
Secondly, a point we'll touch on tomorrow and the day after:
The exploitation by people on the far right-wing who dedicate their lives to racism and xenophobia.
The exploitation of impressionable people who are somewhat fragile or who haven't got what it takes to go against the ideas they've been instilled with.
I think it's basically brainwashing.
His parents' reaction to what's happening?
His parents didn't know what was going on.
They're both alcoholics.
I often had to pick up their youngest from the police station.
- You're whose sister?
- His mother's.
I always thought he'd be violent one day, but against his father, and not against anyone else.
In fact, he's never gotten angry with his father.
He's only just realizing he's done something dreadful.
When I told him:
"Your dad shouldn't have hit you,"
he said: "He only ever hit me when I did something wrong."
He always thought he was in the wrong, not his father.
- It's a bit...
- Yes, I can imagine.
The first time I visited him in jail, he had a look in his eyes that I'd never seen.
It was a bit scary.
He was totally indoctrinated and had changed so much in just 2 months.
It's a second family for them in some way.
It's like they've been intoxicated and they're going through a detox.
They need to see something else.
I don't know...
When you have a second family, it's like a drug, because that's where they exist.
- His ideas are like a cyst.
- Indeed they are.
And you can remove a cyst but you never know what's under it.
A cyst is on the surface.
Then there are roots, there could be a tumor...
Removing it is one thing.
If you don't put something in its place, it's meaningless.
You're leaving them a void.
I don't want to jump in there and do them in.
But there is still this one hurdle, and I don't think I'll ever get over it...
It's knowing what my brother went through.
- Of course.
- In my opinion, it must have been terrible fear and suffering, and that's something I'll never be able to accept.
It's true they told me:
"The trial's important
"because you can't get over Francois' last moments."
His last 5 minutes do haunt me.
And even yesterday, when each one told his version...
I know it's true:
I'm still not over it.
They owe us, but they'll never be able to pay us back.
There's also a notion...
- I thought of this, this morning - of them obliging us...
- I'd noticed this before - to take a few steps forward, to change the way we see them.
We don't know where we're going, but we must move forward, because there's no...
But I also find it really uncomfortable.
Marie-Cecile said something.
She said: "No one held out their hand to Francois.
"He died like a dog."
And I draw a parallel with the hand Now being held out to her.
A kind of reflexive action.
We'll never really know exactly what happened, but I think that when Francois called them cowards, it made them mad.
It was the worse thing he could have said.
For them.
They're done up like warriors and someone calls them cowards.
They think they're supermen... and think he's subhuman.
Yet he called them cowards.
I had no idea what he might have said to them.
But I understand now, saying that made them lose control.
One of them said: "He insulted us."
I think it was the worst insult they could hear.
Because they thought they were supermen.
"Since being here, I often think of that night.
"And i can't stop wondering what went through my head.
"Why we beat him to death, why we went so far.
"I keep telling myself I didn't set out to kill him.
"Sometimes I wish it had been someone much stronger,
"who'd have given us a hammering.
"We might've Learned a lesson and not gone back.
"But sadly, it wasn't the case.
"Beating up someone because I hate homosexuals...
"I still do hate them.
"But why beat up someone Just because i don't like him
"or because he's different?
"You can fight to protect yourself Or your family,
"but not because someone is different.
"When you told me the psychiatrist had deduced
"that i was violent and a probable repeat offender,
"i was very shocked.
"I don't know how he reached his analysis.
'True, what i did must have been misplaced violence,
"and I had often had fights for no particular reason.
"But I don't want that any more.
"Maybe because I'm apart from my fighting buddies.
"But the violence i used that night, and on other nights i had fought,
"was due to violence I suffered as a child,
"when I couldn't defend myself.
"I internalized hatred and violence inside me.
"When I met Fabien and the rest and they told me of their exploits,
"I thought:
I want to belong to their group.
"I felt safe with them.
"Later, Fabien organized a fight between me and another guy he knew.
"i guess it was a test.
That day...
"I lost, got angry and hid away to cry.
"I thought things would be like before:
"I'd be the soft boy who gets pushed around."
They made their own choices.
I know they had no help, but what they did was inexcusable.
I know there are explanations, but that's no excuse.
I agree with you.
So I can't accept that asshole putting on a 45-minute show!
Saying: "I'm very moved by you and by your family."
How would you react?
He's taking the piss!
If he was truly moved, he wouldn't have made a 45-minute speech.
I know they have to be defended, because they have nothing.
- They must be defended.
- Yeah, right.
It's one of our freedoms and part of our law, and we'd be like them if we didn't allow that.
The trouble is, you can't just excuse everything.
You can understand, but not always excuse.
I'm not talking about revenge.
I mean they should admit to their deeds.
It's not revenge, having them say what they really did.
They stole his face, they stole his identity.
They emptied him of all his human attributes.
Their defense is based on their deeds.
No.
What they want...
The prosecutor has asked for 15 years minimum for the minor and 20 minimum for the two adults.
Minimum!
He asked for that minimum!
Their lawyers don't agree, they think it's too much.
I don't know...
I agree with the other one.
I know prison's not adapted to helping them.
But you can't just free them.
- They were talking about it.
- I know.
You can't release them.
That happened two years ago.
Not one of them regrets it or feels any guilt.
Not one!
- Didn't one say sorry?
- No.
Nothing!
One did, but only because his lawyer told him twice to do say it.
That's not coming from him.
I'm not saying the kid doesn't feel sorry at all.
But the lawyer shouldn't need to tell him.
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not.
Anyway, his lawyer mucked up because the court and the jury
Saw that it was directed, it didn't come from his heart.
Even if the kid is sorry.
Maybe he is.
But he was directed, so there's a doubt.
- What's a life worth?
- A life is priceless.
Then I wouldn't put a price on it.
OK, instead of a price, a sentence?
A sentence?
Life imprisonment.
What's that?
A death sentence?
No, I'm against the death penalty.
I'd put them away for life, for the life they took.
What's that?
They took a life, so they give up theirs.
- So life in prison?
- Sure.
- The law doesn't say so.
- That's a shame.
- What does the law say then?
- 30 years.
That's not the length of a life when you're born.
All right.
But what could justify such a sentence?
What justifies it?
What do you think!
The gratuitousness of the act.
But all delinquent acts are necessarily gratuitous.
Not necessarily, no.
In that case, you pardon a lot of things.
You have to try to understand things.
- Enlarge.
- What's the point of jail exactly?
Are you all right?
I don't know how many they'll be.
- If they're quick it's bad, right?
- That's claptrap.
Only in courtroom dramas!
There's no perfect recipe.
It doesn't mean anything.
They need time to consider the accounts and the pleas.
Your closing statement was really something.
- It gave some courage back.
- You'll need it.
You must go on.
You mustn't stop.
I'd say 25... at least 25 years.
I think...
I think that Franck...
Any less will be good.
25 years is too much.
25 years in a life.
But I think he deserves it.
A man died.
I can't put myself in his parents' shoes, but if it was our son, I couldn't take it.
If someone killed my boy tomorrow...
It's awful...
It's only logical.
They lost a child.
I think Franck will get 15 years, and Michael and Fabien, 25.
That's what I reckon.
Plus 3 years for my wife and 2 for me.
That's what I think.
You have adopted a very noble position,
But you're victims, you're owed something.
You owe nothing.
They owe you.
They should have recognized that debt on day one.
But it didn't come.
They didn't express it.
I sincerely think that Michael feels it.
He feels it but didn't express it.
And that pissed me off.
I thought: "What does he need to hear for him to say it?"
It was finally squeezed out of him.
But that's not part of their code of conduct.
It's not part of their mode of expression.
It's not easy for them, I think.
When the three of them finally did say it, it wasn't easy, because there was a lot of emotion, and at the same time... it was hard for us, since we didn't know how to take it.
Thinking it was a calculated move?
No.
Finding a way to show we hear them, but without...
What I mean is, we need to be careful.
Be careful without engendering doubt.
Because we wouldn't want to give them hope, if they weren't ready to show remorse.
However, if they were, then they'd have to...
Show us they'd heard us.
I think they did hear you.
So do I. But sometimes I think I'm...
The future will tell us.
You need to be patient.
That's what I learned when I lost someone close.
You must be patient and demanding of yourself.
You have the right to be strong one minute, weak the next.
- Exactly.
- You need time.
But people think we're strong as they only see us when we are.
But in truth, the moments of weakness...
We know we're weak.
They owe you, they owe you!
I've always said to Michael that he owes you.
You see?
He has a debt towards you.
And he recognized that at the end.
I truly believe he'll act in the way he said he would.
His aunt helped a lot.
I felt that, too.
Throughout the case.
Even at the start, from the first statements.
- I believe it.
- Good.
I believe it about your client.
- It's important to tell him.
- I will.
You say "I've tried to hear you", and then we'll change it.
"Since the death of our son Francois, we have always..."
Sorry: "son and brother Francois".
"...we have always trusted in the free justice of France.
"Justice has been done.
But we now wish each citizen
"to feel more concerned about all they can do
"to stop such a crime happening again.
"We told the accused, since found guilty and sentenced,
"that we have left the door open and we trust them
"regarding the work needed in order to change
"so they will believe in the republican values
"of equality for all and fraternity.
"From now on, we wish..."
Right: "we wish to begin our period of grief..."
- "...end our period of grief." - "Move on."
No, not "move on".
That's not what I feel.
We said we'd see what we could do afterwards.
"...
From now on, we also wish to reflect..."
Maybe you could reiterate:
"...we, as parents..."
Yes, that's good.
- No, but regarding...
- Regarding what?
Hang on a minute!
Goddammit!
This is a discussion!
- We're all working...
- A united family!
Oh, no it's not!
But it is a family with freedom of speech.
And you've taken that freedom, Mom!
We started working on our grief two years ago.
- What work?
- Regarding the three lads, regarding what they did...
We'll start again. "Since the death of our son and brother Francois,
"we have always trusted in the free justice of France.
"Justice has been done.
But we now wish that each citizen
"to feel more concerned about all they can do
"to stop such a crime happening again.
"We told the accused, now found guilty and sentenced,
"that we have left the door open and trust them
"regarding the work needed for them to change
"so they believe in the republican values of equality and fraternity."
For now, we won't change anything.
Rather than "crime" I'd put "attack".
An attack is already a crime.
- No...
- Yes, it is!
It bears more weight on what happens after.
The attack leads to the crime.
- Then add it with "crime".
- Then, "such an attack".
I'd like to question one word...
Sorry, but it seems important.
It's concerning the "open door".
I'd rather use "ajar".
I think there's an important nuance.
"Open" suggests "we forgive you".
We didn't tell them it was "open", but "ajar".
I just wanted to mention that.
- And stick a finger up!
- What a reaction!
- OK, I'll change it.
- Yes, that's good.
It has my seal of approval.
Can I write?
"Since the death of our son and brother Francois,
"we have always trusted in the free justice of France.
"Justice has been done.
"But we now wish that each citizen
"will feel more concerned about all they can do
"to stop such a crime and such an attack

"We told the accused, since found guilty and sentenced,

"that we trust them

"From now on, we wish to grieve
"in peace, out of the media spotlight.
"Thank you very much."
Two worlds met in this courtroom.
Two worlds, because of the values my clients hold dear.
Values like respect for others.
Values with which they raised their four children, and notably Francois.
They kept these values to the end.
These values also led them to say that they respect the humanity of the accused.
They also agreed to listen to what those young men went through at certain times in their childhood.
My clients drew lines for their children.
Yet they are able to understand that other parents do not, which could thus lead to disasters of this nature.
Thank you very much.
I don't know if sentences set examples or not.
I've always asked that question.
I just don't know.
I really, really don't know.
It's true you can be won over.
Like when you see... his father turn up, testify, leave...
The mother too.
One juror, who wasn't selected in the end, says he met them strolling around Rheims in the afternoon.
We're talking about youngsters of 20, 22 years old!
They come, they testify, they leave.
It was pretty surprising on the part of the families...
They had to be there.
One father wasn't.
And then the sentencing of the parents...
I mean, they're complete imbeciles.
And seeing them walk out of here...
Though the prosecutor did say they'll be locked up in 10 days.
Mr and Mrs X didn't even look at Franck, who was sitting right behind them.
Their own son facing years in prison!
If you can call him that, as they barely raised him.
Well for three days, she was sobbing at the idea of going back inside.
Crazy!
The Marne Juvenile Court sentenced Fabien and Michael to 20 years, the minor to 15 years and his parents to 30 months with 6 suspended.
We're not meting out private revenge.
The prosecution's role is to say:
The acts we are asking the court to condemn are very serious for the victim, but also for you, for society.
Here we had a group of young men with shared interests, none of whom were particularly remarkable.
One had been to jail, but they weren't professional criminals.
They were citizens.
They went off on an alcohol-fuelled expedition to "do some Arabs".
But instead of an Arab, they found a homosexual.
Their hatred was then translated into an act of death.
We must work on this upstream and try to understand it.
Justice can't bring a victim back to life, but we can say:
"Taking a life will cost you dear."
Also we must set an example:
"20 years is the minimum if you kill someone
"while letting off steam over some private hatred."
That's the point of this kind of trial.
More particularly, regarding the human dramas played out everyday in our various courts, where people are often surpassed by some situations and don't take precautions to prevent what happens.
But this act was premeditated, it was sought after.
An "operation" was carried out.
That has to be said.
We mustn't be seen to be saying:
"There's a victim, sure.
"But the perpetrators have mitigating circumstances."
I believe, in the interests of society, that this type of deed must be severely punished.
And it must have real meaning.
"Severely punished" means that two young men will spend 20 years behind bars.
That may sound hard, but it totally fits the tragedy and the way it was carried out.
We have to get him to understand... that we live in a society and we've a right to be different.
And that fighting against people who are different isn't what means... you exist.
Because he existed by destroying others.
So he wasn't "the soft lad", as he said.
It's the negation of others.
Until there's only one order.
Just one.
But he has perhaps understood... a little about the diversity of the world from what happened during the trial.
I know for a fact that it has helped him.
At least, I think it has.
The fact that a Mourad Benkoussa defended him definitely helped him.
The fact that I pleaded from the heart and with all my humanist beliefs helped him.
It brought him closer to us, made him less distrustful.
Six months later
This is an open letter to Fabien, Michael and Franck.
"We, the parents of Francois, have decided to write to you today.
"We don't know if you'll read it and, moreover, if you'll reply.
"At the end of your trial on October 8
"we already knew we would write to you.
"We waited several months before doing so
"as we wanted the pressures of the three-day trial to subside.
"During those three days,
"we watched and listened to you.
"We attempted to decipher your logic of hate
"but were unable to do so.
"We attempted to understand the spiral of violence
"that pushed you into killing our son.
"Francois didn't know you, you didn't know him.
"He trusted you.
"He believed in man, whatever his color, religion or customs,
"He didn't flee you, he told you what he thought.
"You murdered him out of fear and hatred.
"You caused his life and yours to topple over.
"You denied his humanity, thus betraying your own.
"The trial told us about your lives, your family, your friends.
"But we also heard from your lips words that suggested
"something was changing inside you.
"Know that in spite of our pain and our suffering,
"we are not driven by any desire for vengeance.
"Justice was done, and rightly so.
"For you.
"To give you back your human dignity.
"The dignity you lost when you killed Francois.
"We know that you, in prison, are victims of violence
"that has turned against you.
"This test will turn you into men capable of thinking
"and realizing courage doesn't mean attacking the weakest,
"but being able to face each other.
"We hope you will try and succeed.
"You must go forward,
"so you are not trapped for ever in that ideology of death:
"Hatred for he who is different to you.
"Reading and thinking can help you to free yourselves of this.
"Meeting others will be easier if you learn to know yourselves,
"with your wounds, your defects and your qualities.
"Through these meetings, learn to love others.
"They are not necessarily your enemies.
"Francois showed you the way.
"He was courage personified, by not responding to violence,
"but by simply being himself and refusing to be humiliated.
"He truly believed we could co-exist by accepting all that we are
"and by refusing all that shuts us away.
"Don't hesitate to seek help where you are now
"to forge a future for yourselves without hatred and violence.
"We truly wish you success.
"If you like, please write to us.
"We'll certainly reply."
We'll soon be posting that letter...
Your handkerchief...
To those who inspired this film, sincere thanks for your humanism
Dedicated to the family and friends of Francois Chenu
Hey,
Still mad at me about the Christmas party?
No.
I'm just starting to realize you might never be the man I dreamed you'd be.
That's the spirit.
Lower your expectations.
Well,
I have one last wedding thing to return,
And once this is done, the only thing I'll have left to remind me we almost got married will be you.
Oh...
Well, I wish Eric had shown up for your wedding.
The sales lady said my mother-Of-The-Groom dress took 5 pounds off me.
5 pounds!
Okay, what happened to my nice breakfast?
I thought we were done with this whole wedding deal.
Women are never done with it, son.
Anything wrong you do,
They sit on it for 25 years like an egg,
And then it hatches on super bowl sunday.
Oh, man, I can't believe I have to take these shoes back to wanamaker bridal.
Now I have to tell that snot Stacy Wanamaker that I didn't get married.
Oh, Donna, I'll take them back for you.
I've always wanted to meet stacy wanamaker.
I mean, she's everything I've ever wanted to be--
Gorgeous, popular, which, of course, I already am,
But she's also married
And to a guy who owns a real estate company that puts her face on his signs.
Oh, she's like a kennedy.
Yeah, stacy wanamaker was a high school legend.
All the guys would say, "I do...
Wanna make her."
I always wish I had a name that could be done to.
Jackie has a nice rackie?
I like Jackie on her backie?
Oh... thanks, you guys.
Well, thanks for dinner.
Thanks for dessert.
Thanks for breakfast.
Thanks for dessert.
Congratulations, Angie.
You just got four different kinds of herpes.
Hey, Hyde, I just learned something very important.
You know that saying, it's like kissing your sister?
Well, it's totally wrong 'cause kissing your sister is great.
Oh, oh, there's stacy wanamaker.
Hi.
I'm here to return these shoes.
- Name?
- Donna Pinciotti.
Good heavens, these are for a giant.
Were they too big?
Oh, no, no.
The wedding was canceled.
Yeah, the groom said, "I don't."
Oh, Donna, how awful.
What?
Oh, no, no.
I--
I just know how complete being married has made me,
And I always feel so sad when I see girls your age whose window to find that kind of happiness
Is so, so small.
It is not that small.
Honey, I've seen a lot of girls like you who wasted years on a guy who never came through,
And before you know it, you're past your expiration date.
Well, that is not gonna happen to me because...
I'm still getting married.
Yeah, see, I canceled the other wedding 'cause I traded in-
- Up.
- Him.
- Who?
- You.
- What?
Yes.
This is eduardo and he's, um...
A prince.
He's the prince of mexico.
Well, then we are going to make your wedding the best wedding ever, right, Donna?
Donna?
- Apparently, that's you.
- Oh, yes.
What?
Yes.
You just have to come to the big wedding expo this weekend.
Oh, well, that sounds great.
Eduardo and I would love to be there.
Right, Eduardo?
Just a few weeks left to stretch those wings, huh, toots?
Eduardo!
What?
Oh, yes, my bride.
Yes.
Hey.
Oh, Hyde, Angie can't make it to the movie with you because, uh...
Well, I plumb wore her out.
Kelso,
Jackie and i are fighting right now
And I'm in a really bad mood,
So if you don't stop nailing my sister, I'm gonna have to smack you in the head with my car.
Actually, you can't do anything to me because
Because after you stole Jackie from me, we made a pact not to interfere with each other's pursuit of a chick.
I negotiated the pact,
Which mainly consisted of Kelso telling me to tell Hyde to sit on it.
How come you guys always have pacts?
You never give me a pact.
I want a pact.
Well, I would love to stick around and chat,
But I gotta go home and take a shower 'cause Hyde's sister wears a lot of perfume,
And she was all over me.
Friggin' pact.
You know, Hyde,
This doesn't have to be a problem.
I happen to know a lot of ways out of a pact, my friend.
That's true.
We once had a pact to get married, but then he just didn't show up.
So you think you can get her to break up with him?
Maybe,
But that would require you and I going into business together, I.E. Forming a pact,
Which would mean
You gotta do something for me.
I don't think so, man.
This is a starter pact.
You handle this,
You get a big-Boy pact.
I don't know, Eric.
A starter pact?
I mean, that sounds a lot like training wheels, and you were on those for a really long time.
Stacy, hi.
Donna, welcome.
Here is your bride-To-Be sash
And a tiara.
Can I get a sash?
What do you do with a sash?
I don't care.
I want a sash.
Welcome to the beginning of a whole new life.
Wow.
This really is a whole new life.
Oh, did you get some champagne, too?
Oh, I can't.
I'm six months pregnant.
Can't you tell?
I'm huge.
She's perfect.
Now, eduardo, you'll have no say in any of the decisions about your wedding,
So go sit in the groom's lounge.
Oh, goody, new friends.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Hey"...
Oh, perfect,
Everyone's here.
Well, look at all of us just
Packed right in here, huh?
Mom, dad, you remember Angie.
Of course they remember me.
I'm the only black girl in town.
Hello.
Funny thing about Angie--
She dates Kelso.
- Ohh, honey.
- Tough break.
So anyone have any stories about Angie's new boyfriend
And some of his crazy antics?
What do you want?
I got one with water,
One with fire,
One where he burned himself underwater.
Oh,
Okay, I got a good one.
Michael, what are you doing with my blender?
Don't worry.
It's not what you think.
I'm making a blender rocket.
I couldn't have daiquiris for a week.
I've got a better one.
Kelso, it's 6 in the morning.
Did someone glue you to the fridge?
No.
Kelso,
Did you glue yourself to the fridge?
Yes.
Thanks, man.
Why does he glue himself to stuff?
Because he's a big dum-Dum.
Next?
Okay, I got one.
Donna, check it out.
I invented car skiing.
Hit it, toots!
You know, if there's anything he should have glued himself to,
It was probably the top of that car.
Steven
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Forman's doing it.
Clearly you're in charge.
Whoa.
It's my pact.
Why wouldn't you think I'm in charge?
Oh, it's probably because of your narrow shoulders, honey.
They just
Don't shout "leader," you know?
Oh, and jim raises a lipstick.
Pretty confident, huh, jim?
That's right, I am all in.
Okay, read 'em and weep--
Two, four, six, eight, ten.
All evens.
Stacy, this is so much fun.
You know, I never thought I'd end up here.
Steven never wants to discuss marriage.
Steven?
My butler-- He is so uppity.
Eduardo, where's my purse?
I was mugged.
Donna, come to my cousin's wedding this weekend and check out her band.
All right, we'll be there.
No, we won't, Donna.
It's insane.
Excuse me.
My fiancée told me I have to give this back.
Angie just broke up with me.
No.
I don't know what happened.
She just dumped me,
Like, out of nowhere, and I was gonna take her car skiing.
I need a hug from your mother.
Take off the training wheels, buddy, 'cause it looks like somebody's ready for his big-Boy pact.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go pull Kelso off my mother.
Jackie, we're not really going to this wedding, are we?
I have to, Fez.
It feels so good to be a fiancée.
But you're not a fiancée.
You're a super cute high school girl that I've been spying on through a window for three and a half years.
Isn't that enough?
Hey,
What's up?
Nothing.
Usually when I ask that question, you don't stop talking till I pretend to fall asleep.
Ah, well, not today.
You look guilty.
What did you do?
Fez, what did she do?
Oh, I wasn't listening.
I was thinking about this prince named eduardo and his lunatic queen.
Seriously, Steven, everything's fine.
All right,
But I'm telling you,
There's gonna be hell to pay if you've donated all my clothes to the goodwill again.
Now we're lying to Hyde?
This must stop, woman.
Fez, I know it's a little crazy, but what if this is all I get?
I mean, what if steven never wants to settle down?
What if I never get a real wedding or real happiness or real anything?
Or real happiness or real anything?
What if I'm just living in my pink bedroom alone forever?
Fine, I'll go.
But please remember, you're never alone in there.
I called Angie, like, 20 times, and she won't even answer the phone.
Wow.
I guess something really turned her off,
Something incredibly
Powerful.
All right,
So I've narrowed it down to two reasons why Angie might have broken up with me--
She's either a lesbian or a robot.
Come on, man, it's just a girl.
You'll get over it.
Hey, do something for you-
Take up smoking.
I don't wanna get over it.
I just want Angie back.
I'm going home.
Wow.
He really liked her.
I feel like I kicked a puppy.
Well, this is what happens when you get into a pact with Eric Forman--
Complete and utter devastation.
What?
So, Fez, what do you think?
You like my dress?
Yeah, it's okay, but you know what would be more appropriate?
A straight jacket...
Because you're a looney tune.
- But, Fez--
- I said cuckoo!
Donna, eduardo, I want you to meet my cousin janie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It is so nice to see two people declare their love in such an expensive way.
So, janie, you are looking good.
What are you doing later?
Um, going on my honeymoon.
You play hard-To-Get.
I play hard-To-Get-Rid-Of.
F.Y.I.--For your wedding, Donna, tables one and two, where we're sitting, are the popular tables.
Tables five and up are your friends you have to invite
And relatives who drive trucks.
We are gonna get caught.
No, we're not, Fez, okay?
No one knows us here.
We'll be fine.
Come on.
I can't believe they put us at table seven.
I went to high school with the bride's mother.
That's it.
I'm milking the open bar as punishment.
Well, hell, we could have stayed home for that.
Hey, Donna,
I'm not wearing any underwear under this.
Does that, uh,
Does that turn you on?
No.
- That only works when I do it.
- Ooh.
Well, sucks to be the next guy to rent this tux, huh?
All right, Angie, here's the deal.
I did want everybody to tell you those stories about Kelso,
And that was wrong
Because he really likes you,
So you have to take him back.
Steven this is so unlike you.
Well,
A friend of mine sent me a really big baggie from hawaii...
So I'm gonna be saying all sorts of crazy stuff over the next couple weeks.
Well, I didn't break up with Michael because of the stories.
I broke up with him because I saw it was bothering you,
And we have a business to run.
Look, just
Do me a favor and take him back.
I'll think about it.
Oh, man, Hyde,
It is not easy doing it on your desk.
Okay, so I may have already thought about it.
He's so good-Looking.
It's stacy wanamaker.
Damn.
I do wanna make her...
Uh, go to beauty school 'cause she's ugly.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
Um, yeah, hi.
I'm Donna Pinciotti.
Donna.
Donna, she says she's Donna.
Donna?
Donna?
Donna?
Donna!
Eduardo.
No, she's Donna.
Why would you lie?
Are you even engaged?
Can't believe a prince was taken in by a common liar.
Hey.
Hey, how was the wedding?
Well,
The service was beautiful, the flowers were gorgeous,
And your girlfriend was a humiliating wackadoo.
Jackie was there?
Are we still walking from the car?
This is taking forever.
Hey.
Hey,
Thought you'd be on a plane back to prince eduardoland by now.
Donna's mouth is as big as her feet.
Jackie, what the hell were you thinking?
Look, Steven, I know it's a crazy thing to do.
It's just
I wanted to know what it was like to be planning a life and a wedding and everything.
I mean, that's all I've ever wanted,
And I was starting to think it was never gonna happen with you.
Are we back on this again?
Why can't you just be happy with what we've got?
Because I'm not, Steven!
Look, I need to know that we have a future together.
Can't you just give me some kind of sign or just a tiny glimmer of hope that maybe someday we'll get married?
Jackie, I don't know.
That's all you ever say!
Please, Steven, please, just say anything besides "I don't know,"
Anything else!
I don't know.
Okay.
Well, then I can't be with you anymore.
Jackie,
Don't threaten me, okay?
It's not gonna work.
I'm not threatening you, Steven.
I can't waste any more of my time on you if it's not gonna happen for us.
Okay, well, at least now I know.
Janie?
Janie?
Has anyone seen the bride?
The limo's waiting and the groom's gonna pass out any second
Janie?
Janie, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Have a little respect for the bride.
Unless you wanna join us, Yes?
No?
Hey,
Still mad at me about the Christmas party?
No.
I'm just starting to realize you might never be the man I dreamed you'd be.
That's the spirit.
Lower your expectations.

So I'm gonna be saying all sorts of crazy stuff over the next couple weeks.
Well, I didn't break up with Michael because of the stories.
I broke up with him because I saw it was bothering you,
And we have a business to run.
Look, just
Do me a favor and take him back.
I'll think about it.
Oh, man, Hyde,
It is not easy doing it on your desk.
Okay, so I may have already thought about it.
He's so good-Looking.
It's stacy wanamaker.
Damn.
I do wanna make her...
Uh, go to beauty school 'cause she's ugly.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
Um, yeah, hi.
I'm Donna Pinciotti.
Donna.
Donna, she says she's Donna.
Donna?
Donna?
Donna?
Donna!
Eduardo.
No, she's Donna.
Why would you lie?
Are you even engaged?
Can't believe a prince was taken in by a common liar.
Hey.
Hey, how was the wedding?
Well,
The service was beautiful, the flowers were gorgeous,
And your girlfriend was a humiliating wackadoo.
Jackie was there?
Are we still walking from the car?
This is taking forever.
Hey.
Hey,
Thought you'd be on a plane back to prince eduardoland by now.
Donna's mouth is as big as her feet.
Jackie, what the hell were you thinking?
Look, Steven, I know it's a crazy thing to do.
It's just
I wanted to know what it was like to be planning a life and a wedding and everything.
I mean, that's all I've ever wanted,
And I was starting to think it was never gonna happen with you.
Are we back on this again?
Why can't you just be happy with what we've got?
Because I'm not, Steven!
Look, I need to know that we have a future together.
Can't you just give me some kind of sign or just a tiny glimmer of hope that maybe someday we'll get married?
Jackie, I don't know.
That's all you ever say!
Please, Steven, please, just say anything besides "I don't know,"
Anything else!
I don't know.
Okay.
Well, then I can't be with you anymore.
Jackie,
Don't threaten me, okay?
It's not gonna work.
I'm not threatening you, Steven.
I can't waste any more of my time on you if it's not gonna happen for us.
Okay, well, at least now I know.
Janie?
Janie?
Has anyone seen the bride?
The limo's waiting and the groom's gonna pass out any second
Janie?
Janie, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Have a little respect for the bride.
Unless you wanna join us, Yes?
No?
Hey,
Still mad at me about the Christmas party?
No.
I'm just starting to realize you might never be the man I dreamed you'd be.
That's the spirit.
Lower your expectations.
Well,
I have one last wedding thing to return,
And once this is done, the only thing I'll have left to remind me we almost got married will be you.
Oh...
Well, I wish Eric had shown up for your wedding.
The sales lady said my mother-Of-The-Groom dress took 5 pounds off me.
5 pounds!
Okay, what happened to my nice breakfast?
I thought we were done with this whole wedding deal.
Women are never done with it, son.
Anything wrong you do,
They sit on it for 25 years like an egg,
And then it hatches on super bowl sunday.
Oh, man, I can't believe I have to take these shoes back to Wanamaker bridal.
Now I have to tell that snot Stacy Wanamaker that I didn't get married.
Oh, Donna, I'll take them back for you.
I've always wanted to meet Stacy Wanamaker.
I mean, she's everything I've ever wanted to be...
Gorgeous, popular, which, of course, I already am,
But she's also married
And to a guy who owns a real estate company that puts her face on his signs.
Oh, she's like a Kennedy.
Yeah, Stacy Wanamaker was a high school legend.
All the guys would say, "I do...
Wanna make her."
I always wish I had a name that could be done to.
Jackie has a nice rackie?
I like Jackie on her backie?
Oh... thanks, you guys.
Well, thanks for dinner.
Thanks for dessert.
Thanks for breakfast.
Thanks for dessert.
Congratulations, Angie.
You just got four different kinds of herpes.
Hey, Hyde, I just learned something very important.
You know that saying, it's like kissing your sister?
Well, it's totally wrong 'cause kissing your sister is great.
Oh, oh, there's Stacy Wanamaker.
Hi.
I'm here to return these shoes.
- Name?
- Donna Pinciotti.
Good heavens, these are for a giant.
Were they too big?
Oh, no, no.
The wedding was canceled.
Yeah, the groom said, "I don't."
Oh, Donna, how awful.
What?
Oh, no, no.
I--
I just know how complete being married has made me,
And I always feel so sad when I see girls your age whose window to find that kind of happiness
Is so, so small.
It is not that small.
Honey, I've seen a lot of girls like you who wasted years on a guy who never came through,
And before you know it, you're past your expiration date.
Well, that is not gonna happen to me because...
I'm still getting married.
Yeah, see, I canceled the other wedding 'cause I traded in...
Up.
- Him.
- Who?
- You.
- What?
Yes.
This is Eduardo and he's, um...
A prince.
He's the prince of Mexico.
Well, then we are going to make your wedding the best wedding ever, right, Donna?
Donna?
- Apparently, that's you.
- Oh, yes.
What?
Yes.
You just have to come to the big wedding expo this weekend.
Oh, well, that sounds great.
Eduardo and I would love to be there.
Right, Eduardo?
Just a few weeks left to stretch those wings, huh, toots?
Eduardo!
What?
Oh, yes, my bride.
Yes.

Preèasoval / Retiming blsho
Hey.
Oh, Hyde, Angie can't make it to the movie with you because, uh...
Well, I plumb wore her out.
Kelso,
Jackie and i are fighting right now
And I'm in a really bad mood,
So if you don't stop nailing my sister, I'm gonna have to smack you in the head with my car.
Actually, you can't do anything to me because
Because after you stole Jackie from me, we made a pact not to interfere with each other's pursuit of a chick.
I negotiated the pact,
Which mainly consisted of Kelso telling me to tell Hyde to sit on it.
How come you guys always have pacts?
You never give me a pact.
I want a pact.
Well, I would love to stick around and chat,
But I gotta go home and take a shower 'cause Hyde's sister wears a lot of perfume,
And she was all over me.
Friggin' pact.
You know, Hyde,
This doesn't have to be a problem.
I happen to know a lot of ways out of a pact, my friend.
That's true.
We once had a pact to get married, but then he just didn't show up.
So you think you can get her to break up with him?
Maybe,
But that would require you and I going into business together, I.E. Forming a pact,
Which would mean
You gotta do something for me.
I don't think so, man.
This is a starter pact.
You handle this,
You get a big-Boy pact.
I don't know, Eric.
A starter pact?
I mean, that sounds a lot like training wheels, and you were on those for a really long time.
Stacy, hi.
Donna, welcome.
Here is your bride-To-Be sash
And a tiara.
Can I get a sash?
What do you do with a sash?
I don't care.
I want a sash.
Welcome to the beginning of a whole new life.
Wow.
This really is a whole new life.
Oh, did you get some champagne, too?
Oh, I can't.
I'm six months pregnant.
Can't you tell?
I'm huge.
She's perfect.
Now, Eduardo, you'll have no say in any of the decisions about your wedding,
So go sit in the groom's lounge.
Oh, goody, new friends.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- Hey.
"Hey"...
Oh, perfect,
Everyone's here.
Well, look at all of us just
Packed right in here, huh?
Mom, dad, you remember Angie.
Of course they remember me.
I'm the only black girl in town.
Hello.
Funny thing about Angie...
She dates Kelso.
- Ohh, honey.
- Tough break.
So anyone have any stories about Angie's new boyfriend
And some of his crazy antics?
What do you want?
I got one with water,
One with fire,
One where he burned himself underwater.
Oh,
Okay, I got a good one.
Michael, what are you doing with my blender?
Don't worry.
It's not what you think.
I'm making a blender rocket.
I couldn't have daiquiris for a week.
I've got a better one.
Kelso, it's 6 in the morning.
Did someone glue you to the fridge?
No.
Kelso,
Did you glue yourself to the fridge?
Yes.
Thanks, man.
Why does he glue himself to stuff?
Because he's a big dum-Dum.
Next?
Okay, I got one.
Donna, check it out.
I invented car skiing.
Hit it, toots!
You know, if there's anything he should have glued himself to,
It was probably the top of that car.
Steven
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
Forman's doing it.
Clearly you're in charge.
Whoa.
It's my pact.
Why wouldn't you think I'm in charge?
Oh, it's probably because of your narrow shoulders, honey.
They just
Don't shout "leader," you know?
Oh, and Jim raises a lipstick.
Pretty confident, huh, Jim?
That's right, I am all in.
Okay, read 'em and weep.
Two, four, six, eight, ten.
All evens.
Stacy, this is so much fun.
You know, I never thought I'd end up here.
Steven never wants to discuss marriage.
Steven?
My butler.
He is so uppity.
Eduardo, where's my purse?
I was mugged.
Donna, come to my cousin's wedding this weekend and check out her band.
All right, we'll be there.
No, we won't, Donna.
It's insane.
Excuse me.
My fiancée told me I have to give this back.
Angie just broke up with me.
No.
I don't know what happened.
She just dumped me,
Like, out of nowhere, and I was gonna take her car skiing.
I need a hug from your mother.
Take off the training wheels, buddy, 'cause it looks like somebody's ready for his big-Boy pact.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to go pull Kelso off my mother.
Jackie, we're not really going to this wedding, are we?
I have to, Fez.
It feels so good to be a fiancée.
But you're not a fiancée.
You're a super cute high school girl that I've been spying on through a window for three and a half years.
Isn't that enough?
Hey,
What's up?
Nothing.
Usually when I ask that question, you don't stop talking till I pretend to fall asleep.
Ah, well, not today.
You look guilty.
What did you do?
Fez, what did she do?
Oh, I wasn't listening.
I was thinking about this prince named Eduardo and his lunatic queen.
Seriously, Steven, everything's fine.
All right,
But I'm telling you,
There's gonna be hell to pay if you've donated all my clothes to the goodwill again.
Now we're lying to Hyde?
This must stop, woman.
Fez, I know it's a little crazy, but what if this is all I get?
I mean, what if Steven never wants to settle down?
What if I never get a real wedding or real happiness or real anything?
Or real happiness or real anything?
What if I'm just living in my pink bedroom alone forever?
Fine, I'll go.
But please remember, you're never alone in there.
I called Angie, like, 20 times, and she won't even answer the phone.
Wow.
I guess something really turned her off,
Something incredibly
Powerful.
All right,
So I've narrowed it down to two reasons why Angie might have broken up with me.
She's either a lesbian or a robot.
Come on, man, it's just a girl.
You'll get over it.
Hey, do something for you.
Take up smoking.
I don't wanna get over it.
I just want Angie back.
I'm going home.
Wow.
He really liked her.
I feel like I kicked a puppy.
Well, this is what happens when you get into a pact with Eric Forman.
Complete and utter devastation.
What?
So, Fez, what do you think?
You like my dress?
Yeah, it's okay, but you know what would be more appropriate?
A straight jacket...
Because you're a looney tune.
- But, Fez...
- I said cuckoo!
Donna, Eduardo, I want you to meet my cousin Janie.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It is so nice to see two people declare their love in such an expensive way.
So, Janie, you are looking good.
What are you doing later?
Um, going on my honeymoon.
You play hard-To-Get.
I play hard-To-Get-Rid-Of.
F.Y.I. for your wedding, Donna, tables one and two, where we're sitting, are the popular tables.
Tables five and up are your friends you have to invite
And relatives who drive trucks.
We are gonna get caught.
No, we're not, Fez, okay?
No one knows us here.
We'll be fine.
Come on.
I can't believe they put us at table seven.
I went to high school with the bride's mother.
That's it.
I'm milking the open bar as punishment.
Well, hell, we could have stayed home for that.
Hey, Donna,
I'm not wearing any underwear under this.
Does that, uh,
Does that turn you on?
No.
- That only works when I do it.
- Ooh.
Well, sucks to be the next guy to rent this tux, huh?
All right, Angie, here's the deal.
I did want everybody to tell you those stories about Kelso,
And that was wrong
Because he really likes you,
So you have to take him back.
Steven this is so unlike you.
Well,
A friend of mine sent me a really big baggie from Hawaii...
So I'm gonna be saying all sorts of crazy stuff over the next couple weeks.
Well, I didn't break up with Michael because of the stories.
I broke up with him because I saw it was bothering you,
And we have a business to run.
Look, just
Do me a favor and take him back.
I'll think about it.
Oh, man, Hyde,
It is not easy doing it on your desk.
Okay, so I may have already thought about it.
He's so good-Looking.
It's Stacy Wanamaker.
Damn.
I do wanna make her...
Uh, go to beauty school 'cause she's ugly.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
Um, yeah, hi.
I'm Donna Pinciotti.
Donna.
Donna, she says she's Donna.
Donna?
Donna?
Donna?
Donna!
Eduardo.
No, she's Donna.
Why would you lie?
Are you even engaged?
Can't believe a prince was taken in by a common liar.

Okay, well, at least now I know.
Janie?

Has anyone seen the bride?

Janie?
Janie, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Have a little respect for the bride.
Unless you wanna join us, Yes?
No?
This is India... the land that glistens, shines... the land bedecked with the glitter of dreams... beckoning you... if you nurse a hunger, she says, here... you'll find what satisfies it.
Come... rub your shoulders till they're blue... with fame, wealth, power, glory... and your life becomes... a sunlit dream you never want to wake out of
Yes, this is India...a dream... that Bunty and Babli dreamt every night of their lives
And this is the India they live in... an India that says... your dreams should end where your arms do... and you should feel only as much hunger as you can satisfy... step forward.... but only when you're in step with the others... float to the top but not at the cost of anyone else
love, compassion, honesty, respect... are what matter most... this too is India... the India Bunty and Babli grew up in but didn't feel like they belonged to
This world we live in has two kinds of people
One, the kind that does just one thing all their lives and... the kind that does... just about everything in one life I didn't say that, they did and they didn't just say it, they lived it
And how !
No one ever lived life... like they lived theirs and perhaps... no one ever will
So much excitement...
so much adventure, so many joys... all in one single lifetime... no one could have imagined it possible, not even them.
Or then again... maybe they could have

Small town cocoons These dull afternoons... I want to pack them up and go away... away...
The rains come slow The river lies low...
The sea will carry me away
Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Watch the smoke billow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Hear the whistle blow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Call me, oh, watch me go...
Stand aside, make way for me Those clouds are mine to hold
Burnt in black on a white sheet sky I'll write my name, big and bold
On the street that curves around the moon...
At the bend is where l'll stay
On the street that curves around the moon I'll stay far, far away
Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...
Dhin'tinak'dhin Dhin'dhin'ta
Small town cocoons These dull afternoons I want to pack them up and go away... away...
Small town cocoons These dull afternoons... I want to pack them up and go away... away...

The sea will carry me away
Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Hear the whistle blow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Watch the smoke billow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Call me, oh, watch me go...
When I ride I carry in my hair...
The cool whispers of the wind
Ride across the earth, the sky Leave the world behind, unhinged
My forehead adorned, my jewel, the moon I can't walk unnoticed amidst the stars
My forehead shorn of all but the moon I can't live unnoticed up here with stars
Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...
Call me, oh, watch me go... watch me go... lt's not going to come.
- lt will lt won't.- lt will
Boy, go down to the tap and have your bath
Or you'll be standing at the end of a very long line
No dearth of people wanting to get into a line
What do you mean?
- What I mean Ma is... this world has two kinds of people, one, those who line up before taps... and two, those who make themselves taps so they won't need to stand in any line
I happen to belong to the latter.
- You don't belong anywhere
You've already spent forty rupees on this gibberish
How much more will you blow up?
- Ma, how many times do I tell you... I'm not spending anything.
This is an investment
For fifty bucks, this shower is up and running... then I'll fix it... to the community tap and everyone's willing to part with fifty paise... to bathe in a shower.lf five people use it everyday, that's 2.50
In twenty days, fifty bucks are back
That's 2.50 in profits everyday from each shower
Stop.
You're making my head spin
The problem with this Fursatganj, talking sense sends heads spinning
Anyway, do you remember my chit fund idea ?
A finance company in Lucknow...
- l don't want to know anything !
If you don't stop now you'll surely go to jail some day
There...
I told you it'll come
Of course it will.
Why won't it ?
How else will he drown his future ?
Why... oh today was your interview for the railway job !
You didn't go ?
I went !
Pandey'ji called to say that... before I recommend my son for another interview... I should at least make sure that he drags himself there on his own two legs I've lain my thirty five years in the service on the line... and made him agree for another chance tomorrow
Thank God he agreed
How does that matter?
I need to agree too
Rakesh, we're trying to be serious here I told him I don't want to be a ticket collector
So what do you want to be ?
The maker of failed schemes, for life ?
All of Fursatganj thinks you're a deluded Don Quixote
You want them to coin new euphemisms for you ?
Everyone...
Fursatganj is packed with asses.
And all asses can do is... chew the cud and bear the burden.
I wasn't born to do either
Oh you'll become a Birla-Tata-Ambani?
- Why can't I be ?
They didn't fall out of the sky.
They too were born here on this earth
At least they were born here.
You belong to a different planet altogether!
Dad, don't get me started again.
I've made up my mind I'm not going to waste my entire life trapped in a job
Look here I've spent thirty five years in this job You think my life's been a total waste ?
After a lifetime of service, does the government even bother... about your opinion?
After thirty five years of... shuttling up and down that same train route, does even one passenger... from all those thousand trips remember what you look like in your shabby coat ?
When you die, will anybody except Ma and I, shed a single tear ?
Will the railways take a day off ?
Dad your life means nothing.
There's no respect, no fun, no meaning
When I walk wearing this shabby coat, that seems to embarrass you so much... people stop in their tracks to pay me their respects
Shopkeepers are up on their feet to attend to Mr Ticket Collector
Why?
Because my poor black cotton coat... is untainted by ill-gotten gain... it is the mark of my esteem
Rakesh... the interview is at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning
Get there in time.
Or get lost
Find a meaning for your life wherever you want, however you want to
Because we can't live up to your high expectations... we're sorry
There's something about you baby
You too
You're not half bad either
Go easy on the lipstick... it shouldn't look too tacky.
And one thing you ought to know
A ragged skirt doesn't make you sexy lt's what's in your eyes...
like in mine
Dear God... my daughter has gone insane!
- lf worshipping my beauty... is tantamount to being insane, then I plead insanity lf craving for fame is insane then I plead insanity lf the desire to renounce this pigeon-hole Pankinagar... for the great wide marvellous world outside is insane... then I plead complete insanity
And you are driving me nuts.
Take off that shirt l'm sorry, I don't believe beauty needs cheap exposure
One tight slap and all your beliefs will change
You've ruined all his best shirts
Ruined ?
These shirts will fetch millions.
There'll be grand auctions
Supermodel Vimmi's shirts !
The ones she wore when she dreamt of success
Ladies and gents, do I hear a hundred thousand...
One...
Two...
Three !
Jassi, where's my shirt ?
Right here...
What's she up to now?
- She's just fooling around...
Fooling around...?
Go on, enjoy yourself... till the time you can
What are you trying to do?
- Trying to be coy about my marriage
But doesn't seem to be coming too naturally
Your father isn't joking.
You won't find a man like Surinder... even if you turn Kanpur and Lucknow inside out.
Count your blessings... a head clerk has fallen into your lap that too in a place like Pankinagar
Papa'ji, I think...
I'll run away from home
Listen to her !
I kept telling you we shouldn't allow cable tv in her room
All day-and-nights she's whispering to those naked witches on her walls
And now she even wants to run away.
- No harm in that, no ?
You go ahead, run away
But see, it's 1 1 o'clock.
Eat lunch before running
What are you saying?
- l don't want a weight on my mind... my daughter running away on an empty stomach ?
I'm warning you, I'll really run away if you even think of marrying me off... to that... that ten out of ten!
- Ten out of ten ?
That ass always got ten out of ten in every godforsaken subject... what a nerd
Who wouldn't want to marry such a man?
- Then why don't you ?
Spare me
Now get out of that outfit and help your mother with the cooking I've called them to lunch tomorrow
I want things to be finalised before the evening tea hits the table
Enough.
Don't make me hurt you
Why are you taking them off?
- You don't know why ?
It's time you realised that you can't live like you want to anymore
You'll have to adjust to your new family's ways
You'll eat, drink, walk, sleep the way they want you to
Look, I'm your mother.
All I want is to see you happy
Forget all of this
You're leaving this for a new world.
- lt feels like I'm leaving the world
The more you think about it the more you'll hurt
Just do as I say.
You'll learn to be happy
Mummy, if I request Papa'ji not to marry me off just yet, will he listen ?
The facial cream is on the washbasin.
Don't forget to apply it
Tea... piping hot tea...
A little extra milk never killed a cow.
- Sir ?
I said, two extra teaspoonfuls of milk never killed the calf's mother.
Pour
There's more milk than water in it, sir.
- More milk, I said
Hey give back my glass
Catch it if you can
Your name sir?
- l'm what you'd call Raj Kapoor Tiwari
Where's your seat here, show me... I'm not on your list...the other one.
I talked to the ticket checker, paid him
Oh, so you've paid him a bribe
No, no...
- Give me your address
Why do you need my address ?
Do you see that berth number ?
Take a look.
- Number seven
Coach FC1 , berth number 7
Always reserved for... the Fursatganj staff going to Lucknow.
I've been using this berth for 3 years
The entire railway division knows that.
How could anyone have given it to you ?
Could you tug that chain for me please ?
Trust Finance Chit Fund Company Loans, chit funds for every need
You think you're the first person to come up with this idea ?
We spend eight hours a day in offices like this, chewing tobacco, eh ?
200 out of every 1 00 finance companies dream of a scheme like this... but trip over their own two feet... trying to find 500 investors to chip in a thousand rupees each
The answer to my next question is on your face but... I'll ask you anyway...
Mister, where are your 500 investors ?
What if I tell you I have them ?
Where...?
Here
I've slogged it out for a whole year, sir i've gotten together 500 investors from my town and the neighbouring ones... willing to put up a thousand rupees each in any good finance company
Where are you from?
Fursatganj
Fursatganj !
Where I was once
Not one finance company... will waste five minutes over a list like this one
Talk of investments
Small town-guys have a habit of dreaming big.
No ban on dreaming indulge yourself
But next time, come up with a scheme that... a thousand others haven't thought up before you.
Get it ?
Now excuse me
Where are you going, lady?
- To enter the contest
You can't go in.
- lf l can't go inside... how do I take part in the competition?
Let me in. I've come really far I said, you can't go in.
- l say, I have to enter
Can I help you ?
- Yes, myself Vimmi Saluja... I've come to enter the contest.
- You're too late
What...?
- The entries closed two days ago
You mean the contest's begun?
- No, not yet
Oh, that's a relief.
- l said, entries have closed
But the contest hasn't begun!
- l said "the-entries-have-closed"
So open up for two minutes, I'll quickly squeeze in !
You're from some village?
Miss Quickly-squeeze-in !
This is no village fair to squeeze-in-slip-out when-you-wish
This is the Miss India contest, but what would you know ?
Oh c'mon Pammi, forget it
One minute... would I know what ?
- The desire and the ability... to become Miss India are two very different things.
So go home... and start a beauty parlour.
- Why not beauty-parlour yourself ?
Excuse me ?
Ever watched your figure ?
At least ten kilos overweight... with black-dyed hair and desperately-curving-lipline... with miles-thick lipstick.
You know all about make-up.
Beauty parlour's for you
What a bitch
Listen...
Yes?
- Please come with me to the toilet lt's right at the end of the platform and it's really dark
Come
Weren't you on the Jhansi Mail this morning ?
Returning?
Here on business?
- Yes I came for the Miss India contest
So how was it ?
Good... very good I got through the first round
Good... good...
Miss India !
And you ?
Here on business too?
- Oh no... no...
Work is something I don't really believe in I came here for a meeting
There's a finance company here, they want to buy my scheme I had to come personally you see, it's a matter of millions
So, you're becoming a model soon?
- l guess so
You'll become famous.
- Yes...
I guess so
People will buzz around you like bees around honey
Yes...
I guess they will
Why are you crying ?
I didn't mean to insult you
No, don't take me otherwise I belong to a decent family, I wouldn't dream of it
Calm down, everyone's watching
Poor thing... she's in grieving I was only sympathising...
Everything's fine
You'll be the first girl to cry after making it to the Miss India contest
I didn't make it anywhere
Aren't you ashamed of lying ?
Actually, I lied too... the manager of the finance company didn't quite buy my scheme... I think he doesn't have the drive
Bloody idiot
Foulmouthing... me...?
Escort her to the loo and then get abused for it ?
I escorted you !
Who do you think you are ?
You mean if you go back now...?
- Wedding bells...
That's too bad.
- Very
Then ?
I'll run away.
- You already have
So, what'll you do now?
- What'll you do ?
Whatever I do, I'm not giving up.
And I'm not going back home
Then, where will you go?
- Kanpur
Why Kanpur?
- The company has a head office there I'll show my scheme to senior officers, I'm sure they'll get it
Why don't you come along to Kanpur?
- Who me...?
Miss India contests are held all over.
Maybe they'll allow you to enter there
You got to find a way into the contest, else what use was running away ?
So long, I guess the next time I see you it'll be on TV I guess so.
Thank you.
And good luck for your big meeting
Thanks but that was superfluous. I only need to make a presentation and... voila !
I'll have 1 00 finance companies running rings around me
See you
Unbelievable.
Got to admit...
very few people have brains as sharp I say, just once in a whole year, let me meet just one such person
But two in a single day, unbelievable!
Would you believe... just half an hour ago, another man came to me with an identical scheme
Who?
- Manager of our Lucknow branch...
Mr Qureishi !
Imagine... a rare gem lay buried in my own backyard
He got a 1 0,000 bonus on the spot !
He even had a list of 500 investors
Unbelievable !
What a man !
- Where's he staying ?
Landmark Hotel.
- ln Landmark !
And why not ?
The 1 0,000 bonus !
Give me as much I'll go to live in a five star too
Next?
- Vimmi Saluja
Address?
- 2/5 Ballygunj, Pankinagar
One minute...
Doesn't Pankinagar fall within the Lucknow district ?
It does?
- Yes, Lucknow district
You didn't fill up the form in Lucknow?
- What difference, here or there ?
I was passing through Kanpur so I thought I'll get it over with
Very good
Please step outside
Sir'ji, just a matter of an address...
- Go away !
Rules are rules
Please...
- Get lost
Oversmartness
Look, I can't bend the rules
But if you wish... I can forget rules for a while
Yes sir!
- But nothing comes for free
Sir, I'll do whatever you wish !
Very good!
Once you're Miss India... you'll have all the wealth, all the fame your heart ever desired
But I?
I'm still stuck to the same ... chair and table
Oh sure... I have nothing right now...
but I promise, when I'm Miss India... I'll pay you...
everything you'll ever want
You're mistaken.
You have everything I'll ever want... right now I won't force you.
Registration closes in five minutes.
Think it over
You'll find me at the same table
What's your name?
- Jajjan
You make tea?
- No, I serve tea
This world we live in boy, has two kinds of people
One, those who serve tea.
And those to whom tea is served
The faster you become one of the latter, the better the life that you'll live
Has somebody hurt you ?
Two teas and chips
Two?
Why ?
Problem ?
- No.
But who's the second cup for?
If I drink two cups, will it start a war?
God, this world we live in...!
Get a hold on this kid
It's no use.
- What ?
No use being earnest, unwitting fools getting shoved in stinking little towns
Then...?
- Bombay... the only city in all of India where a man is recognised for his worth... the only place where you can start from the pavement and end up in palaces... where ambition isn't pushed around, but cheered, egging you on
How're you so sure?
- How... if Dhirubhai Ambani, Ratan Tata, Birla had been in Lucknow-Kanpur... they'd be swatting flies in Ambani General Stores, Tata Flour Mills
And Birla Tobacco Stall.
Bombay...
gave them the recognition they deserved
Look where it got them...
So you want to go Bombay ?
You can come along too.
What'll you do here ?
All the top models are in Bombay.
Damn this narrow-minded small-town mob lt's the place for Miss India, no?
- Yes
A ticket to Bombay, how much would it cost ?
Not that I have that kind of cash
I got the cash, don't worry.
- What...?
We've seen where truth has landed us.
Now let's say what they want to hear
And what's that...?
- Oi Jajjan, where's Landmark Hotel ?
One whiskey...
- Which one sir ?
Imported.
How much for a Black Label?
- Four hundred, sir
For a bottle ?
- No. 30 ml
Small peg I'll try an Indian whiskey for a change.
And don't forget the peanuts
Some pretty suave people you got walking into this Gazal Bar
One Black Label
Sir
Sir !
You here ?
Fursatganj !
All of Lucknow seems to be pouring into Kanpur today
Slick !
What are you doing here ?
- You'll be seeing more of me here
What do you mean ?
- My scheme got rocking
Which... the same one ?
- No... it was unworkable
You tipped me off in time.
I could've wasted another good year
This is another scheme.
- Which is this ?
I explained this scheme, they offered me a two per cent stake in the channel
What channel...?
- A news channel
News channel
Nowadays this news channel business is taking off like a rocket ln 3 months, they're giving investors a 300 per cent return on investment
Cigarette ?
- Really ?
How much... is the investment ?
- At least 1 00,000
Won't they take a little less ?
I mean, I could invest too...?
Why don't you have a chat ?
Give me an introduction
This is Mr Qureishi
- Q.Q.Qureishi
Q.Q.Qureishi, a very dear friend.
Whatever I am today is because of him
Mr Qureishi would like to invest in the channel
How many millions ?
He's not like other investors...
this is just a friendly gesture... about ten thousand ?
- Ten
Ten...?
Fifteen... ?
But you're aware, it should be at least...
Ok, all right, now how can I refuse you ?
One request, this remains between us ... let this be our little secret
No, no... !
- Promise
We must be in Delhi by morning
So you take the cash from him... and fetch us a receipt from my room ln the meantime, if he has no objections Mr Qureishi can give me company
Yes ?
Well ?
- No...
I mean no problem
Ten ?
Fursatganj, don't forget the receipt
Would you like to dance with me Mr Q.Q.Qureishi ?
You dance really well.
- Thank you
Where's the ladies' room ?
- Thank you
The washroom... where is it ?
- Bartender, where's the washroom ?
Run
What d'you think of my acting ?
Better than yours ?
Who conned him to your table ?
- Who made the sucker dance ?
I'd love to see Q.Q.Qureishi dancing
Hey, the cash
Some sample
Your share.
- You keep it lt's your share.
- Not a gift
Just bank it for me till Bombay.
I can't manage money
We had fun though, no ?
Lots...
Move it.
Sit in the bus
Passengers for Dehradun and Ambala, your bus is leaving
Name ?
- Bunty
And the Mrs ?
Babli
Bunty...
Babli... seats 2 1 and 22
Get inside
Bunty...
Babli... what the hell...?
- Nothing... move on. 2 1 and 22
What do you mean nothing?
- Sit down, I'll explain
When I was a kid I always blamed Bunty for all the mischief I did
And we've just stolen money.
So...
- But... what the hell is Babli ?
Why, what's wrong ?
I don't have a problem with Bunty
You look like your Bunty !
But Babli... she sounds like a fat slob
Fat or thin, now it's sealed.
- You could've asked me
Ask my wife her name in front of a bus conductor ?
Who are you calling your wife ?
- l didn't say that, he thought so
And you let it pass !
Now everyone in this bus thinks I'm Bunty's wife
What are you doing ?
Everyone will think Bunty's wife is a shrew
Stop it !
- You stop it I'm not talking.
- Suits me
Babli, big deal
At least we managed enough to get us to Bombay
This stash won't last us a week in Bombay
And...?
And...
I think we'll need lots more if we want to make it in Bombay
Where will we get so much money ?
- The same place we got this from
You mean another... ?
Are you mad ?
What are you saying ?
- l'm not saying a thing.
Bunty is
And I'm doing what Bunty's saying ?
- Who are you to do ?
Babli will
Babli ?
But I am Babli !
- Sure
You are when you are
You aren't when you aren't
Say, what are you now...?
Bunty.
You...?
Babli...?
TmG
Babli Bose, Food Inspector.
I'll inspect your kitchen
We hear, the beer is adulterated here.
- Tony, a chilled beer for the sahib
One step, two step, he steps it up swings it, pumps it, struts his stuff
Meet Bunty
Minute by minute, she turns it up spins it so you can't get enough
Meet Babli
Spinning like tops, orchestrating rip-offs... they'll clean your pockets, cock a snook and be off
There ain't a legit soul from who they never stole
When they dig, they dig so deep you can't get out of that hole
Bunty Saluja, Tourism department.
Unclean rooms.
Got to inspect
Unclean ?
How many days of inspection ?
- Three
Bunty And Babli
They maybe two... but they're too much
Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch
Consider it your's
Take it away... fly away, she's yours
What model number is this ?
- Model number can take a hike !
Why isn't your man back yet ?
- What man ?
Man... means husband.
- Husband !
What crap.
You bloody fool
Love is wild like pigeon wings
Tantrums trip on diamond rings
Don't you blink
You might see their shadows pass
Tea cups clink.
Tea cups crash.
Forgive, forget, they have a fight... wipe their mouths and take full flight... come, come, come on, come on, one step, two step, swing it Bunty
Bulandshahr is abuzz with the amusing misadventures... of this daring duo who call themselves Bunty and Babli
People seem to be in awe of their ingenuity and audacity
Would you like a room or a suite ?
No, I don't want just a room I want the hotel...
we're here to buy this place I never thought I'd sell this place.
But your strong background... and this mind blowing offer...
I'd have to be a lunatic to refuse
How long are you here ?
A week maybe...
- Stay here then... as our guests
This hotel's as good as yours.
We'll discuss details over the weekend
No, doesn't look good.
We can't stay before we've signed the dotted line I won't take no for an answer
Well if you insist... champagne ?
Searched every inch of Mussoorie sir, I can't find them
What do you mean ?
And their stuff ?
- They even stole ours
Damn them
Come away, come away
All our sparkles fly right across the sky
Then we sight the morning light Float up high
Witness the magic of Guru'ji
People running after you like this ... it's a heady feeling
What...?
- Makes me feels like I'm an achiever
They walk wrapped in perfume mists
Hold the world in love-locked fists
You won't see them flit about till they want you to, and when you do... he slides with a swagger.
- He's Bunty
She glides zig-zagger.
- She's Babli
Their tales are lore...
been told a score times and more
And will be sung forever more I can't see any tunnel here...
- We've paid a hundred bucks apiece
Where's that Bunty guide ?
Spinning like tops, orchestrating rip-offs... they'll clean your pockets, cock a snook and be off... there ain't a legit soul from who they never stole... and they dig so deep you can't get out that hole
One step, two step
Swings it, pumps it, struts his stuff
Oye Bunty
She turns it on, spins it so you can't get enough.
Oye Babli
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli
They maybe two but they're too much Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch
I'm so hungry I can't think straight
And you will shut up and eat whatever's available.
No tantrums
Makes you cry ?
What's to cry about ?
- None of your business
Look, what I meant was you can't get pizzas out here
All right, I'll get whatever you feel like
Tell me what you want
Who...?
- l want my mummy
But... out here...?
I miss her
You miss her a lot ?
Go on, get it over with
Over ?
Not over !
I'm missing her, not laying an egg !
Over !
What do you miss ?
When I was little...
Papa'ji would talk about taking us for a holiday, far away from Pankinagar
But in all my years of waiting, we never saved up enough for a holiday
You want to send some money home ?
Do you want to call them ?
Come...
No one's saying anything
Then why are you wasting your breath ?
- l don't know why...
I think it's Vimmi
Who's this ?
Some nut
Papa'ji lt's me...
Papa'ji
Vimmi, my child...
where did you disappear ?
I'm okay Papa, I'm fine
Vimmi my child, where are you ?
I can't tell Mummy, but I'm fine
Look dear...
No Papa'ji, don't ask me to come back now...
I don't want to come back
But I really love both of you
No, my child, listen to me...
- No Papa'ji. I'm hanging up now
Bye... I love you both very much
You want to call home too ?
No
Folks at home must be worried about you too
No one worries about me
What are you doing here ?
Wondering where he's now ... how he's doing
Do you think I was too harsh on him ?
- You were right in whatever you did
Have your tea, it's time to go to work
Enough ?
Satisfied ?
If you manage money like this in Bombay in no time, you'll be back... in your punk-whatever-town.
- Pankinagar, you bloody idiot
Wherever, but you're finished.
- What's left to count ?
You've blown it all up.
- l have, have I...?
Expensive dresses, shoploads of makeup just fell out of the sky ?
They came from the same place as your watch, designer shirt, jeans... and... this deodorant that smells like turnip pickle gone bad
They fell off the sky, they did
Now what ?
I've been thinking...
Let's... do it one more time ?
- No... we've pooled enough to get us to Bombay.
- Vimmi this world we live in... has two kinds of people.
One...
those who collect enough and those... who'll never have enough.
Myself and Tata-Birla-Ambanis are the other kind
That's why they're where they are today.
And once we're in Bombay... we won't get another chance.
So...
let's take one last crack.
Just once more
You think so ?
I know so.
So I say so
Who says so ?
You or Bunty ?
- Bunty's always saying so
Today a little of me is with Bunty.
- Oye Rakesh... my sweet bloody idiot
This one.
- No problem
There's just one problem
Just tell me.
- l'm leaving for Mussoorie tonight
Oh, that is a beautiful place - l know
Tomorrow I have an inauguration.
- Your inauguration ?
Not mine... my hotel's
Oh, I see
Look Mrs...
- Miss...
Miss... earliest we can deliver would be by tomorrow morning lt's closing time, you see ?
And we can't stay open for one machine
No, no... not one machine.
- Then ?
All.
- All...?
But if the mall isn't open...
- No...
I'll open up myself...
I mean... I'll open it up myself for you
Lovely
Sixty thousand
You take cash don't you ?
- l take anything you say
Let's shop
Easy brother, easy.
The stuff inside is real precious
Sorry for troubling you so much.
- You can trouble me as much as you wish
Please visit our hotel sometime.
- Sure
Your machines are now yours
Here's the balance amount
Thank you very much
- Mention not
May God send customers like you my way every day I pray we come by shops like yours everyday
I have the same...
We seem to share similar tastes.
- l wish we find more in common
Mehmood !
Let her rip.
- You sound like he's after us already lf he isn't, then he soon will
Oye Bunty, you gave him a licking ?
300,000 worth of shades
400,000 in watches
700,000 in electronic items
Deal
Time for a Chinese lunch.
Come I can't count any more
The incredible incident at the renowned Center One Mall in Bareilly... has confounded the police.
Sources say, the perpetrators of this heist are...
Bunty and Babli whose capers have already made headlines in many cities
Even as investigations proceed, by now Bunty and Babli must be far far away
Tomorrow morning !
Bombay.
- That soon ?
Before you've brushed your teeth.
This train gets there like a bullet
Good.
We can get to work the minute we get there
You're hunting for the top models ?
- Like you're catching your Tata-Birlas
Your share
Always splitting cash at the drop of a hat ?
What's with you ?
Let's just get it over with, no ?
So tomorrow... you get on with your life, I'll get on with mine
What'll you do without me ?
I mean, on your own... in Bombay ?
Hog the whole bathroom ?
You'll have complete freedom too, no ?
Nobody will be getting on your nerves
Well you didn't bug me that much.
- Really now ?
The way you fought, I would have to be the meanest man in the world I can't believe, by tomorrow morning I'll be in Bombay
All these dreams, all these years...
is everything finally coming true ?
Flap your wings, come on let's fly
Flap your wings, let's taste the sky
TmG
Balle-Balle on a Sundae-Sunday
Flap your wings, come on let's fly.
Flap your wings, let's taste the sky
Let's set the streets of Juliet on fire.
Dance with Romeo in the streets of desire
We explode with the light
Burn the dance floor, girl
Nach Baliye Dance the Balle
Want bangles on your wrist, love ?
- Nach Baliye
Want jewels in your hair, love ?
- Nach Baliye
Run anklets around your feet, love ?
- Nach Baliye
Give me bangles on my wrist, love
Weave jewels into my hair, love
Run anklets around my feet, love
Love to watch you baby, turn around
The red carpet of dreams unfurls for us to walk on
Fate's now a little toy, to toss, to roll, to rock on
Take your bets now, gamble your life.
Fate's at my feet.
Ready to ride ?
Then come... take my hand, love... I'll give you the ride of your life
Then take my hand, love... give me the ride of my life
Let's set the streets of Juliet on fire, dance with Romeo in the streets of desire
We explode with the light
Burn the dance floor, girl
Dance the Balle
Clap your hands everybody, everybody just clap your hands
Day doesn't sink into night here
These roads stay awake, alight here
Tip-toeing upon my eyelids are dreams that never sleep
Then take my hand, love... I'll give you the ride of your life
Attention
Train from Delhi to Bombay is arriving on platform 36 instead of platform 1 2
Bunty-Babli's largesse for the poor Con duo named in several heists
Bombay's really crowded, no ?
Everyone's here to make their dreams come true, no ?
What's this stench ?
Must be fish, no...?
Where do you think fashion shows happen here ?
Let's get you into a taxi
- And... you ?
I'm going back.
- What !
Look, I don't want to stay in Bombay.
- What do you mean ?
I just... wanted to be really famous...
a name to be reckoned with... a name in the headlines
Vimmi, for the first time in my life I think I have a talent no one else has
I realise now, I never was Rakesh.
I've always been Bunty... I've always enjoyed being him
To tell you the truth, I never had the perseverance it takes... to become a Tata or Ambani, nor the calibre
Anyway, doesn't matter now.
I think I've discovered my destination
And I'm on my way towards it
Look... this is what I want to do... all my life, freely
But you please become a model, a supermodel... so take care
All this... you did it all alone ?
That's not what I meant.
- Then...?
Without you...
- You can't walk one step, you know ?
Wants himself in headlines !
Who wants to read about you ?
No one's interested in reading or publishing a Bunty-minus-Babli
Truth is... without me, you could've done nothing and you never will
Your taxi...
Tell me... can you ?
Yes
No
Can you live without me ?
Yes
Then why are you screaming taxi-taxi ?
- Because you need to go
Yes...
- So tell me... where ?
Where you want to go
Who says so ?
You or Babli ?
What do you think ?
Must be you
So will you do something about it ?
If that's the case then I must do something about it, no ?
What the hell !
I didn't mean that
Wasn't me. lt was Bunty.
- Everyone's staring
We're in Bombay.
No one looks at anyone here
Think it over I won't let you rule over the bathroom.
- Done
No more sleeping alone on the floor.
- Sounds good
What about all the modelling dreams ?
- That's Vimmi's problem
But you...?
- l've become Babli
Forever
You know what it's worth ?
Not five paise. lt's a fake
Who...?
- What...?
What's your name?
Mehmood
You're a comedian ?
Let's start by making you laugh ?
Okay, two jokes for you
One
Mrs and Mr Flea come out after a matinee show
Mrs Flea says, I'm tired today
Mr Flea says, honey don't worry, I'll hail us a dog
You are that dog...
the one they rode for the hike
Now spill it, did you go to Center One that night or no ?
No sir
This here, is my second joke
Where are those two now ?
Long time... gone
Names...?
Bunty and Babli
How old are they ?
Bunty's around 23-24
Babli is 20-2 1
She was really sweet, well mannered and intelligent, sir
Even the boy was all heart, great guy
That's quite something, sir
No, you asses are quite something
To think that petty criminals... booked for cheating, misdemeanour, malfeasance, fraud and perjury... are quite something
And not just you, the whole lot of you from this generation is quite something
Right and wrong, good esteem and bad, good deeds and bad... you've forgotten what sets them apart
But I can tell the difference.
And I'm going to teach you fools too
The newspapers say that for boys and girls in schools and colleges... these two crooks are role models.
- So they want to be role models ?
Fine... then that's what they'll become... I'll make them a fine example of a cure for this generation
What did you say their names were ?
- Bunty and Babli
This Bunty-Babli better watch out for me
We'll never ever cheat on each other
We'll always place each other before ourselves
Okay
We'll never ever break each other's hearts
And if we do so accidentally, we won't burst into tears without warning
Okay, we will never eat or drink anything without each other
Except early morning tea
You wake up like a queen at noon I can't wait that long
We'll give each other the same amount of love forever
Why ?
We can give more !
I'll love you even more tomorrow... more the day after and so much more the day after the day after
We'll cut off all ties with those who don't understand us
Except our parents.
- Your parents
We'll be Bunty-Babli for the rest of our lives
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except...
Except...?
- Leave that to me
Okay
Now the groom may kiss the bride !
- Oye Rakesh just married !
Look... right at the outset of this marriage I want to tell you all about my past
I don't want any issues later ln school, when I was in Class Two, Mukesh used to sit behind me
He used to tug at my plaits
And you know...
it used to make me giggle like crazy
These boys are all scoundrels
They'll try their luck with every cute girl
How true
How lucky l am, you aren't like those boys
Rakesh... you're such a good boy
Sweet boy
So... what I was saying was...
now that you are my wife... my mate in joy and sorrow... for all my days to come... and nights... understand ?
Asleep ?
On your wedding night !
This world we live in has two kinds of people... those who aren't married and those who are
So...?
So you belong to the latter, no ?
So ?
So marry me now you fool
TmG
The clouds have torn
My sky has flown
I see my skies breaking free of the earth at the horizon... soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit... soft, slow, tip-toeing my love
Do you see what I see...
the earth flows like a river... earth in water, water in earth dissolve and begin to shiver
Then my sky breaks free of the earth at the horizon
No consciousness of what I am I have no sense of what I'll be
This time now seems unreal This can't be happening to me
You slowly dissolve in me I slowly fade into you
Our feet stop, pick up a dream Our paths shift, it's coming true
The sky turns over lazily on it's cloud bed lt just might melt, rain down to kiss the ground
The earth dips its toe tips in a water well lt just might find feet roll up, start walking around... soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit... soft, slow, tip-toeing my love
Say the word and I stop.
Say the other and I move lf this is madness that consumes me, let it be a madness too
Say the word and I stop.
Say the other and I move
A stranger to my destinations I go where you want me to
Soft, bit by thieving bit
Softly, my love
Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's Each other's forever they'll be
Each other's forever...
- They'll be
They began their lives... in small sleepy towns, towns they detested
So they popped up in big cities doing the kind of things I detested
Not for poverty, need or misfortune.
Only for fun
Turning to crime for fun?
I'd never ever heard that before
News of Bunty-Babli's capers poured in from all quarters... dripping into my ears like red hot molten iron
Girls and boys in schools and colleges began to idolize them as new age heroes
Constantly breathing down their necks, I even started to think like them... what next, their next sharp turn...?
My hunches were hitting bull's eye... and I was inching closer to them with every passing day
They took their infamy for success and quickly jumped from cons to scams
Scams no one had ever heard of or imagined before
Okay, how about Kerala ?
- Too hot
Manali ?
- No, it is too cold
Jaipur ?
- lt's too dusty
Ladakh ?
- lt's too lonely, Harry
How many times am I gonna tell you, it's a damn historical monument... not a hotel which I can rent
That's your problem Harry, you said if we came to India... I could get married wherever I want.
This is what I want
You are impossible
Am I...
I am ?
- Yes
Really ?
Fine !
- Yes
Do you see what I see?
- l'm not blind
Do you hear what I hear ?
- l'm not deaf
Are you thinking what I'm thinking ?
- l'm no mind reader.
Get to the point
Protesters... thirty.
Taxi drivers...?
- Four
School children ?
- Twenty.
With one teacher
Newspaper ?
- Agra Times
Minister's office.
- Very good !
And a wedding bash.
- Oye Rakesh !
A first round knockout
I want to marry there Harry, not put it in my living room I told you it's not possible Kate
Selling Taj...

Today's newspaper sir ?

- Yes sir

By him, sir
Excuse me
Hold on
No sir, it is not possible.
We cannot sell Taj Mahal to a foreigner
Even if the price is high ?
- No price is too high for Taj Mahal
How about 1 00 million dollars?
- No sir 1 50 million.
- No sir
1 75 million.
- Sir, I told you, it's not possible 200 million.
- Well... 250 million
Why don't you speak with her?
- Who ?
Phoolsakhi'ji
Who is Phoolsakhi'ji ?
Minister in charge of purchase and selling of the Taj Mahal
Where's the typist ?
She's down with viral fever.
We're getting another typist
Get her quickly.
- l'll be in the office all day today
Let's pack in as much corruption as we can today
Of course.
- The typist is here madam'ji
Sit
My niece's doctoral thesis.
I want it typed out by this evening
Of course, it's me.
Go on
What...
I'm coming right away
What's the matter ma'am ?
- Riot outside my house !
Hurry
You keep typing I'll be back in an hour
How long have you been in government ?
- Not very long
And the minister ?
- Not very long either
Sir...
You brought the other money ?
I can't believe !
Someone is actually selling the Taj Mahal
Nor can I believe !
Someone is actually buying
This ass is going to get kicked
Crowshit on your egghead
He'll be crying for help in two days
How do I look ?
- Very fine
How are you madam ?
Would you believe I've been dying to see you ?
Madam, this is Mr Harry Epstein
He wants to buy the Taj Mahal
Exactly I'm not selling
But madam, we had a deal...
- Why are you late ?
But ma'am...
Shut up
So you can't sell the Taj Mahal to me ?
It's all a big mistake
And you have wasted my time
One minute
I said I can't sell the Taj Mahal but it doesn't mean you can't have it I don't understand
You can lease it on rent
For how long ?
Five years
Ten
Lease document ready for five.
interested, not interested ?
Interested, interested
Why are you protesting ?
- Because we have grievances
What grievances ?
- Meet our demands or else
What demands ?
The revolution...
- Long live the revolution
Never mind that, but what are your demands ?
Down with tyranny
Whose...?
- Every tyrant's
Five years
All Harry Epstein's
For a price of 250 million dollars.
- Good doing business with you
And here is your fee 5 million Rupees, cash

Quit India...?
- State your demands or I'll arrest you
We demand that Ms Kalasakhi...
- But I'm Phoolsakhi !
Tell them !
- You've got the address wrong
She is Ms Phoolsakhi.
Now get out.
- Okay.
Sorry.
Fine.
Relax.
Don't mind
Okay then, goodbye.
- Thank you madam
See you.
- Namaste
Which country are you from ?
- Oh, all of them
Your guests should be here soon
Goodbye
What happened to this elevator ?
- Could be stuck somewhere lt's coming.
- Let's go
Finished ?
- Nearly
It sure is nice of Mr Bunty to throw us this wonderful wedding party
And you !
Thank you, it's a dream come true
Not possible
What do you mean not-possible, I own the Taj Mahal ls he nuts ?
He says he owns the Taj Mahal !
Poor thing, God can really be cruel sometimes
Open the gate before I fire you ... dismiss you
Dismiss ?
He says he'll get us dismissed
Doctor ?
You need one ?
We call doctor ?
No doctor !
You talk to Mr Bunty
He wants some Bunty fellow
What Bunty...?
Hey wait a minute are they Bunty and Babli ?
So finally you arrive !
They sold the Taj and scooted while you stood by and watched it happen ?
Tomorrow when you sell it again I'll still be left watching
What !
- Look madam... a bull doesn't budge until he sees red in his face... and it takes a scam to prod me into action. I just got the news, no ?
That's no way to talk.
- Really ?
And how did they talk ?
Go on, file your report about descriptions, characteristics
Stop staring at me and do it
No one could've pulled off this caper without the help of insiders
Who could it be ?
- Could've been you, madam
You left her alone in the room at a perfect time
Corruption happens at the top floor.
But one has to climb from the ground floor
There's a saying amongst us policemen.
Orderlies make more under the table
See son... you shouldn't have gone to the wedding, that too in a new car.
Getting it ?
Hey trumpet
Yes sir ?
What's the most requested song nowadays ?
Babu'ji, slow it down now
Stand up here
Play
I heard you took an American to his wedding altar
No sir i know their names.
I want to know where they are
Harry says, he was so smooth, and convincing.
Harry's no fool
And you believed ?
- l did lt was in the Times of India.
- All newspapers say... all Americans have sex all the day, I believe ?
Don't look at it, you hear me ?
Don't look at it
Sir how about leaving ?
What can we possibly get to know here ?
Here you learn to what lengths a man can go... for the smallest of things
Get the serial numbers of the currency that he withdrew from his bank
Tell me joke
Non-veg
Tired of turning wheels ?
Now watch how the wheels of fortune turn I didn't see a thing.
What can I say?
I'm a simple honest man
God !
This one turns out to be honest!
Wheel back that car... go on... back out... go away, far away
There.
Stop
The longer the distance, the more it looks like an accident
Don't move or I'll shoot.
- Sir, what are you saying ?
I told you !
I saw nothing.
- No one's ever seen... what's about to happen right now
Come on, slam the car.
- No... please
Slam him.
- Please !
No... I saw, I saw!
I saw everything
Turn off the engine
Stand straight
See no evil.
Speak no evil.
Hear no evil but if you can profit, grab it
Gandhi'ji would've come here personally to whack you for being so honest
Who else was in it with them?
Go on, give him every detail
What's wrong ?
Why are you sulking?
You're upset with me ?
Moron, the Taj got sold, not your taxi.
Like some nuts ?
No ?
Suit yourself
There was no corner of the country Bunty and Babli hadn't been to
And every newspaper was cheering their ingenuity
But I was dying to see them behind bars
No there's no mistake about this order.
Your assignment is being changed
But I've completely committed myself to the case
Bunty-Babli's case is being assigned to the federal agencies
To whom ?
- Federal investigation
God
Our politicians have become honest?
The feds have time for Bunty and Babli ?
They have your sympathies?
- Not those two
My sympathies are with the feds.
- You think the feds can't get them ?
Why ?
- Because they can't think like them
And you can?
I'm beginning to feel we're related somehow
From tomorrow, you're taking charge of the gold at the airport
Very well sir
You're the boss I'll take charge of hell if you want me to
Anyway what's the score?
- What ?
I found myself a night-watchman's job.
This is how I got to bide my time
Dashrath Singh... lf there's anybody who'll lay a finger on Bunty and Babli, it's me
You find this funny ?
You can do this yourself the next time I won't be able to do this even if I tried, love
But you can make a mockery of those who do ?
Ok, I'm sorry
- What idiot could've made you a father
You
One rum, large
You don't need to pay sir
Did I mention I'm a policeman?
- Hear me out, sir
The gentleman out there is hosting food and drinks for all guests tonight
Who...?
- The man in black
They're buying this restaurant
No way.
We're picking up the tab for everyone tonight
Not tonight.
Tomorrow
From tomorrow, this hotel is yours to do as you please.
But tonight's on me
Friends, cocktails and dinner for everyone on the house
Vodka
Whiskey
Cocktail?
Gin
Rum
Flying to the moon?
- You're selling the tickets ?
You've just bought yourself a one-way ticket I don't believe much in buying tickets but yes, I do want to fly to the moon
You're a man in a hurry?
Somewhat
There's this one place in which men-in-a-hurry usually end up
You see...
- What ?
This world we live in has two kinds of people I see.
- One, the kind that listens
And the kind that talks.
I belong to the latter
So sure of yourself ?
What do you do?
- Cleaning l'm in the cleaning business.
We clean out places
What kind of places ?
- Any kind
So you like tidy places?
- No, I like tidy sums of money
Interesting man.
Where are you from?
- Allahabad
Aha, you look that type
Sir, one more large ?
Bring it on then
What's happening here ?
You're smoking in front of your baby?
- How the hell can he see me ?
Babies know everything.
- How can they know everything ?
Stop it I get the feeling I'm her baby
And he who is he ?
I... am...
- He is...
Whoever, doesn't matter.
Come on
Women... are like this only.
- How and how do you think women are ?
Oye, don't stoke my anger.
- Hello, what's happening here ?
A fight can't you see?
- That I can, but why ?
Private matters of husband-wife!
How meddlesome
Please stub that out
You look like a long lost father!
Ought to be setting an example for him
And you better come along.
I'm checking out the rooms in this hotel
Don't take too long
Don't come back in an hour or two.
Spoilt the mood for no rhyme or reason
You seem to be much fallen-in-love
You've never fallen... in love?
Once, a little
What?
A little
In a summer of Delhi l came upon her
Every single day on bus number 481 ... I would fall all over myself to vacate the ladies' seat... and she would sit down with the sweetest smile
For a whole year...
- You never spoke ?
When our eyes were saying so much how could words dare to interfere ?
But... I can shower her with gifts, can't I ?
So every week, I'd fall over myself to give her my gift
And she...
- Would smile ?
And take it
And I'm sure that one day, in return for all my gifts she would give me... that one big gift I've been waiting for.
- So did the gift arrive ?
Winter arrived
On the 2 1 st of December... wrapped in a maroon shawl and a warm smile... she stepped into the bus.
Radiance on her face and in her hands... a Golden Bakery box.
Inside that box... were the world's most beautiful heart shaped... you know... heart-shaped pastries
And then for the first time in a year... she spoke her first words to me
Please... would you distribute these pastries to all the passengers I just got engaged
Ei handsome
What happened ?
She's calling you
Who is ?
Tonight's your night
Those pangs you feel in your heart have pained me too
Why not drown our pains tonight?
Nice
Rare are those moments in life when desire calls
Come into my arms, or come and slit my throat
Oh forget it... this give and take of hearts takes a lot of heart... and doing it so boldly for the world to see... it's a woman's art you see ln this winning and losing of hearts what are men worth ?
His ruthless gaze... tore up the street... took me apart lt ran a razor's edge down the willing side of my heart
TmG
I fall to restless pieces... don't look at me that way
I fall to restless pieces, don't look at me that way
A townful of men in ruin surrenders to what I say
stretch with desire, I take my bow I stretch with desire... come touch me now
Night eyes... night eyes... your night eyes...
The moon sleeps inside those night eyes
Night eyes, your night eyes Night falls inside those night eyes
Night eyes, my night eyes We are one inside twin night eyes
Night eyes, your night eyes The moon sleeps inside those night eyes
These sighs you swore, wrote them in kohl
Come to life inside these eyes
That kiss you left on my handkerchief I knot it until it dies
Oh your words are wisps from incense bowls
You waft in lazy like the warm wind rolls
I bow, I stretch... come touch me I stretch with desire, I take my bow
Night eyes, my night eyes You're a shadow inside my night eyes
These eyes take me by surprise
Ask private questions, brook no lies
Hide under those veil-like lids
The curtains behind which she shies
No curtains hide my pain, no lies try to guard me I hurt only when she gives her word not to scar me
Night eyes, your night eyes I was stung when I sung to your night eyes
Night eyes, your night eyes The moon sleeps inside my night eyes
You are mine in the memories of old stone cities
Our songs still echo in those forlorn cities
From the south gate arch to where the north gate lies... you and I are lore set in stone cities I hear the call of the saint on the wall
And swear by the black beauty of your eyes I'm the guardian from evil your eyes never had I'll suffuse them with smiles so they never look sad
Our bodies, they ache Our lips, they quake
Come touch me, oh touch me, oh touch me now
Tonight is the night, the night is tonight
Tonight's the night, oh night-eyes
I love the way you sway
Madam, I am your only Adam
Night eyes...
oh the dark of her nights in my eyes
Why do you dole out free drinks?
Why give free drinks, you fool!
How will you run your hotel ?
Anyway... I enjoyed your company
I feel satisfied and a little in love
And it helped me forget those two
Forget them... you've nothing to do with those scoundrels
Generally... I don't take to strangers too well
But I don't know... I don't know why the two of you have touched my heart
We've done what...?
- Touched my heart... you could've been my children
You haven't told us your name.
- You haven't told...
My name is Dashrath
Dashrath Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Police
You're a police'wallah?
- What did you think ?
Balloon' wallah?
Why what's come over you ?
What's it ?
- Rickshaw' wallah...
Sit in the rickshaw
Go on, take him home.
- Yes, take me home lt's very late.
- Very late at night
Take me to the airport ... no not there I'm going to Police Lines.
- Go on, quick
Oh my God, the very same Dashrath Singh the one who's been after us ?
My baby almost had a heart attack!
That was close, let's get out of here
Get out ?
The fun's only just begun
- What are you talking about ?
Look, he never knew what we look like.
He still doesn't.
But now... we know who he is and we also know that... he's in charge of the security of the gold stashed at the airport
By God !
You are...
- Vimmi, if we don't... steal the meat right from the lion's den... what did we achieve?
- Your hunger's getting out of hand
Now we're a threesome.
We'll need more food... what do you say ?
You'll get us killed someday
India's Central Bank doesn't keep it's gold in any one place
To protect the gold from fires, floods or earthquakes... the cache is split over four different cities
Depending on the requirements of various banks... this gold is shuttled by air between these four cities once every week
How they cracked this confidential information, they haven't divulged
But what they did that day no one could have ever imagined
Not even me...
Delhi-Mumbai, 9.1 0 pm tonight.
Korpal, Puneet, Mr
Delhi-Calcutta, 9.40 pm.
Sharma, Vandana, Mrs
What's this other ticket for?
- Backup
Why the Air Traffic Control number?
- Backup
A back up for everything?
Oye Rakesh, is there one for you too ?
Yes
Who ?
You
Smart
Call back the Jet airways flight Mumbai.
The bomb is ticking
What nonsense.
A bomb on the plane ?
Jet 9W31 2.
Yes Delhi Control ?
Turn back and proceed for landing on emergency runway number 2
There is a bomb scare
Delhi Control is this a joke?
Bomb on board, he says
Jet 9W31 2.
Turning back
Which runway?
- Number 2.
Bomb squad is on the runway
The caller's number.
Get it now
Go get the number from them.
Now !
We can't have the number lt isn't under our jurisdiction.
- As long as the gold is on board... this plane, the bomb, this airport, everything is under our jurisdiction
How many people knew about the gold?
- Four bank employees
Are you implying the news was leaked?
- Give me the key to the box
But we are not permitted to open it.
- Give me the key
Now it's your responsibility.
- The bomb might explode any time, sir
The bomb has exploded.
Send message to headquarters. I am assuming command
DCP Dashrath Singh here...
Surround the airport area
Locate persons who do not have any reason to be here at this hour
Take suspects into custody and inform immediately
They received the bomb scare from this number
Dial
Ringing
Orange Maruti Swift 5700
Vimmi we'll have to ditch this car.
They've spotted it.
Get out
Stop... taxi
Stop... please
Papa'ji, please help us !
I'll give you more money than you ever imagined
Son, for this job, I won't take money even if you give it to me... come my child, get up, you'll do fine
Have faith in god.
Faith prevails
Sir, what are you saying ?
Policemen in every hospital and nursing home ?
We won't have men for policing the city.
- She's in labour.
She's about to deliver
Every child born in Delhi tonight will see a policeman's face... before anything else
That Dashrath Singh figured me out.
- How are you so sure?
I know. I saw it in his eyes...
Then... in no time every hospital in Delhi will be crawling with policemen
Which hospital do you want to go to son ?
The biggest...
the biggest hospital in Delhi
Not a hospital or nursing home, they'll go to a nondescript clinic lf l know that Bunty, he'll definitely take Babli to the biggest hospital
Vimmi, don't be afraid
This hospital is packed choc-a-bloc with newborns and their mothers lt'll take them ages to check each bed.
But you please hurry it up lt isn't in my hands, bloody idiot !
I told you you'll get us killed someday
Hush
But hey, what life did I have before I met you ?
is everything all right?
- Yes
Papa'ji... if you weren't here today...
- There would have been someone else
The Lord up there runs a regular courier service
He always provides for ones in need
Where are you going ?
You can't go in
Pointless... he must've taped the gate downstairs.
Walk
Those two have fled the hospital but they haven't fled Delhi yet
Seal Delhi, sir
Papa'ji, all that you've done for us...
- One honest man would do for another
Papa'ji, you're kidding me
By now you must have figured that we aren't half as honest as we seem
I don't know what you've done to make these people hunt you down... but I see a simple honesty in your eyes... take care son.
God bless you
For the next week or so they'll be baying for our blood
We'll return afterwards... but where have you hidden the gold ?
What's your baby, a boy or a girl ?
What will you name your baby ?
Before you think of a name you need to see the baby at least ?
A day has gone by, have you even taken one look at your baby ?
Did you hold your child in your arms, even once... once even ?
Vimmi, you know we didn't have any time for these.
Had I stopped for all this... all three of us would've either been jailed or killed by now
Some reason for celebration !
The day he is born... his parents die
Cursed fate to be born with !
- Not his fault, is it ?
That's what I'm saying!
What wrong has he done... to deserve parents who can go to jail anytime... leaving him to rot on the streets
What are you trying to say?
- Enough I won't do this anymore.
Neither will you...
Then what else can we do?
- Anything, whatever everyone else does lf we had to end up doing what everybody else does... why did we ever run away from home?
- Because we were wrong
Now we're not free to live as we like.
Now we're responsible for one more life
How's he going to grow up?
- How ?
With us, that's how
With us?
And which school will he go to ?
You know this world we live in has two kinds of people.
One... who waste the best years of their lives in schools and colleges.
And... the kind who school themselves.
Like us.
We taught us to do what we're doing
Which is what he'll learn?
- Of course !
And then he'll go to jail someday?
- Have we ever been to jail?
We very nearly got thrown into jail I don't want my son growing up behind bars... or dying young on the run
Do you remember agreeing on all our marriage vows except...
We'll be Bunty-Babli for the rest of our lives
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except...
Except...?
- Leave that to me
Okay
This is the exception Rakesh
You're getting over-emotional about this motherhood business
But now I am whatever I am.
Now I want to hear your decision
Choose. it's either this life ... or a life together
So what have you decided?
What'll I do without the two of you ?
Those marriage vows weren't mere words
Fursatganj or Pankinagar?
is it you that's saying this or... ?
Bunty and Rakesh.
-Both
What ?
Tickets
Since when are we buying tickets ?
- From today
Why become so damn honest ?
Oye Rakesh, you're in love
Oh all right
Rakesh my boy, this world we live in has two kinds of men.
One... the kind that thinks twice before getting married
And the kind that thinks afterwards like you, you idiot
Two tickets for Fursatganj
Name ?
Rakesh Trivedi, Vimmi Trivedi
Bunty and Babli
You've had a long run.
You must be tired
Can we have some water ?
Die of thirst dog !
Not for me.
For the two of them
You won't believe me but we quit being crooks half an hour ago
Absolutely right, I won't believe you.
- But if I insist I'm telling the truth ?
I'll start doing right now what I had planned to do to you in jail
Why are you looking at me like that ?
- He's telling the truth
Guaranteed by you, India's biggest bonafide liar ?
I'm not lying
A dog's tail insists it became ramrod straight half an hour ago ?
You're as old as my father... no one's had the cheek to talk to her like that
So you respect your elders now, do you ?
- And why shouldn't we ?
Now don't tell me you pray first thing every morning too !
She does
So...?
- So what !
Now you pray to your heart's content in jail !
It's all your fault... now suffer.
- My fault ?
Who's idea was it to go straight ?
- lt was for a good cause... do you want your son to go to jail ?
- So where's he going now ?
Now I see how the two of you have been fooling people for years
Pappu is hungry
Pappu ?
When did we start calling him Pappu ?
Got to call him something no?
You're thinking of the gold all the time
Let's step outside for a while I'm not going anywhere.
- Up
Darned luck.
No one ever caught us when we were in the thick of it
But the moment we quit...
- Why did you get into all this ?
I wanted to become someone important.
- And... you became ?
You won't understand.
- Why... why won't I understand ?
Because he never did.
- Who ?
My father
He's just like you
You're trying to con me again
May I...?
- A smoke ?
Sure...
Where are you going ?
If she sees me smoking she'll scream
The child will stay with the mother
What's the use of crying now ?
Should've considered this beforehand.
- What else to do ?
Become a ticket collector and collect ten rupee bribes all my life ?
You can come in
We'll have to make a phone call to your home or mine
We certainly can't take him with us.
- No, it won't come to that I'll figure something.
- And con ourselves out of this one too ?
What else to do ?
Take with me to jail, the very son for whose sake I gave up everything ?
What justice !
Jails are for reforming.
And here, three people are being jailed
Two of whom have reformed and a third who's completely innocent
Don't worry Vimmi. I'll crack a plan.
- What plan Rakesh ?
We've run out of plans
Vimmi do you have any idea what jails are like ?
How will you spend so many years inside one ?
Let's do something, I'll take the blame for everything
Then you're free to go home to Fursatganj with the baby
All you wanted was to become a model I dragged you into this whole thing
You can't even make a cup of tea for yourself. ln jail... how ?
I'll manage Vimmi, don't worry about me
Have you ever managed to do anything alone ?
In any case, Bunty is nothing without Babli
Get up
Unlock yourselves... I can't do it...
We're nearing the railway signal on the outskirts of Delhi
The train halts there for two minutes
The two of... the three of you can get off and go wherever you wish
No one recognises Bunty and Babli except me
And no one ever will
Sir...
- Shut up.
Not a word
Or I just might change my mind
Get going
That's enough
Whether it was my life's biggest mistake or their best con act, I didn't know
But policemen are human too, believe it or not... we wear those uniforms only on our body, at heart we're as vulnerable as babies
I believed I had destroyed Bunty-Babli, so I let Rakesh and Vimmi go... because I think the law needs to destroy crime, not lives
The bank's gold was recovered from the spot Babli had indicated
The recoveries continued for months afterwards... monies and valuables stolen by Bunty and Babli I think they had told me the truth about going back... to live respectable, honest lives like their parents
Rakesh'ji could you perhaps increase the pressure
What a joy
This world we live in has two kinds of Pappus.
One... the kind who obey their parents and get to eat chocolates and the kind that doesn't and gets locked up inside toilets
You are...?
- The first
My darling baby
But he didn't even drink his milk.
- He'll eat the chocolate
What good are chocolates?
You and your fads
No, I'm feeling cold...
- Forget the cold.
Be fashionable
What are you teaching Pappu ?
To speak the truth and pray every morning
Where's my son ?
One of his friends is waiting downstairs
Friends and folks in Fursatganj find all the time for fun
You fix the name of this city.
I'll fix this friend
My son is genius from... childhood
I am very lucky l got a daughter-in-law who is very very smart
It's such a joy to know that our son and his wife... have done things so important that your department still remembers them
Never told folks at home what all you achieved ?
Maybe you should tell us
Nervous already ?
A scam is in the offing
Huge scam
Sir... I swear by my son, I've given it up
I've no idea of what scams are happening
For three years now, I'm following a work-home-work routine
This scam has got to be stopped.
- Then go ahead and stop it
We cannot stop it
Who else can ?
You
Then save me from this respectable-dignified life !
Please
Who's saying this ?
You or...?
- We both I'm through lf l make mango pickle one more time I'll die lt's killing me, Rakesh
Keep the faith
Once upon a time he told me that he was in the business of cleaning
So I put them on the job of cleaning up society

This is India... the land that glistens, shines... the land bedecked with the glitter of dreams... beckoning you... if you nurse a hunger, she says, here... you'll find what satisfies it.
Come... rub your shoulders till they're blue... with fame, wealth, power, glory... and your life becomes... a sunlit dream you never want to wake out of
Yes, this is India...a dream... that Bunty and Babli dreamt every night of their lives
And this is the India they live in... an India that says... your dreams should end where your arms do... and you should feel only as much hunger as you can satisfy... step forward.... but only when you're in step with the others... float to the top but not at the cost of anyone else
love, compassion, honesty, respect... are what matter most... this too is India... the India Bunty and Babli grew up in but didn't feel like they belonged to
This world we live in has two kinds of people
One, the kind that does just one thing all their lives and... the kind that does... just about everything in one life I didn't say that, they did and they didn't just say it, they lived it
And how !
No one ever lived life... like they lived theirs and perhaps... no one ever will
So much excitement...
so much adventure, so many joys... all in one single lifetime... no one could have imagined it possible, not even them.
Or then again... maybe they could have

Small town cocoons These dull afternoons... I want to pack them up and go away... away...
The rains come slow The river lies low...
The sea will carry me away
Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Watch the smoke billow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Hear the whistle blow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Call me, oh, watch me go...
Stand aside, make way for me Those clouds are mine to hold
Burnt in black on a white sheet sky I'll write my name, big and bold
On the street that curves around the moon...
At the bend is where l'll stay
On the street that curves around the moon I'll stay far, far away
Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...
Dhin'tinak'dhin Dhin'dhin'ta
Small town cocoons These dull afternoons I want to pack them up and go away... away...
Small town cocoons These dull afternoons... I want to pack them up and go away... away...

Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Hear the whistle blow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Watch the smoke billow
Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Call me, oh, watch me go...
When I ride I carry in my hair...
The cool whispers of the wind
Ride across the earth, the sky Leave the world behind, unhinged
My forehead adorned, my jewel, the moon I can't walk unnoticed amidst the stars
My forehead shorn of all but the moon I can't live unnoticed up here with stars
Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...
Call me, oh, watch me go... watch me go... lt's not going to come.
- lt will lt won't.- lt will
Boy, go down to the tap and have your bath
Or you'll be standing at the end of a very long line
No dearth of people wanting to get into a line
What do you mean?
- What I mean Ma is... this world has two kinds of people, one, those who line up before taps... and two, those who make themselves taps so they won't need to stand in any line
I happen to belong to the latter.
- You don't belong anywhere
You've already spent forty rupees on this gibberish
How much more will you blow up?
- Ma, how many times do I tell you... I'm not spending anything.
This is an investment
For fifty bucks, this shower is up and running... then I'll fix it... to the community tap and everyone's willing to part with fifty paise... to bathe in a shower.lf five people use it everyday, that's 2.50
In twenty days, fifty bucks are back
That's 2.50 in profits everyday from each shower
Stop.
You're making my head spin
The problem with this Fursatganj, talking sense sends heads spinning
Anyway, do you remember my chit fund idea ?
A finance company in Lucknow...
- l don't want to know anything !
If you don't stop now you'll surely go to jail some day
There...
I told you it'll come
Of course it will.
Why won't it ?
How else will he drown his future ?
Why... oh today was your interview for the railway job !
You didn't go ?
I went !
Pandey'ji called to say that... before I recommend my son for another interview... I should at least make sure that he drags himself there on his own two legs I've lain my thirty five years in the service on the line... and made him agree for another chance tomorrow
Thank God he agreed
How does that matter?
I need to agree too
Rakesh, we're trying to be serious here I told him I don't want to be a ticket collector
So what do you want to be ?
The maker of failed schemes, for life ?
All of Fursatganj thinks you're a deluded Don Quixote
You want them to coin new euphemisms for you ?
Everyone...
Fursatganj is packed with asses.
And all asses can do is... chew the cud and bear the burden.
I wasn't born to do either
Oh you'll become a Birla-Tata-Ambani?
- Why can't I be ?
They didn't fall out of the sky.
They too were born here on this earth
At least they were born here.
You belong to a different planet altogether!
Dad, don't get me started again.
I've made up my mind I'm not going to waste my entire life trapped in a job
Look here I've spent thirty five years in this job You think my life's been a total waste ?
After a lifetime of service, does the government even bother... about your opinion?
After thirty five years of... shuttling up and down that same train route, does even one passenger... from all those thousand trips remember what you look like in your shabby coat ?
When you die, will anybody except Ma and I, shed a single tear ?
Will the railways take a day off ?
Dad your life means nothing.
There's no respect, no fun, no meaning
When I walk wearing this shabby coat, that seems to embarrass you so much... people stop in their tracks to pay me their respects
Shopkeepers are up on their feet to attend to Mr Ticket Collector
Why?
Because my poor black cotton coat... is untainted by ill-gotten gain... it is the mark of my esteem
Rakesh... the interview is at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning
Get there in time.
Or get lost
Find a meaning for your life wherever you want, however you want to
Because we can't live up to your high expectations... we're sorry
There's something about you baby
You too
You're not half bad either
Go easy on the lipstick... it shouldn't look too tacky.
And one thing you ought to know
A ragged skirt doesn't make you sexy lt's what's in your eyes...
like in mine
Dear God... my daughter has gone insane!
- lf worshipping my beauty... is tantamount to being insane, then I plead insanity lf craving for fame is insane then I plead insanity lf the desire to renounce this pigeon-hole Pankinagar... for the great wide marvellous world outside is insane... then I plead complete insanity
And you are driving me nuts.
Take off that shirt l'm sorry, I don't believe beauty needs cheap exposure
One tight slap and all your beliefs will change
You've ruined all his best shirts
Ruined ?
These shirts will fetch millions.
There'll be grand auctions
Supermodel Vimmi's shirts !
The ones she wore when she dreamt of success
Ladies and gents, do I hear a hundred thousand...
One...
Two...
Three !
Jassi, where's my shirt ?
Right here...
What's she up to now?
- She's just fooling around...
Fooling around...?
Go on, enjoy yourself... till the time you can
What are you trying to do?
- Trying to be coy about my marriage
But doesn't seem to be coming too naturally
Your father isn't joking.
You won't find a man like Surinder... even if you turn Kanpur and Lucknow inside out.
Count your blessings... a head clerk has fallen into your lap that too in a place like Pankinagar
Papa'ji, I think...
I'll run away from home
Listen to her !
I kept telling you we shouldn't allow cable tv in her room
All day-and-nights she's whispering to those naked witches on her walls
And now she even wants to run away.
- No harm in that, no ?
You go ahead, run away
But see, it's 1 1 o'clock.
Eat lunch before running
What are you saying?
- l don't want a weight on my mind... my daughter running away on an empty stomach ?
I'm warning you, I'll really run away if you even think of marrying me off... to that... that ten out of ten!
- Ten out of ten ?
That ass always got ten out of ten in every godforsaken subject... what a nerd
Who wouldn't want to marry such a man?
- Then why don't you ?
Spare me
Now get out of that outfit and help your mother with the cooking I've called them to lunch tomorrow
I want things to be finalised before the evening tea hits the table
Enough.
Don't make me hurt you
Why are you taking them off?
- You don't know why ?
It's time you realised that you can't live like you want to anymore
You'll have to adjust to your new family's ways
You'll eat, drink, walk, sleep the way they want you to
Look, I'm your mother.
All I want is to see you happy
Forget all of this
You're leaving this for a new world.
- lt feels like I'm leaving the world
The more you think about it the more you'll hurt
Just do as I say.
You'll learn to be happy
Mummy, if I request Papa'ji not to marry me off just yet, will he listen ?
The facial cream is on the washbasin.
Don't forget to apply it
Tea... piping hot tea...
A little extra milk never killed a cow.
- Sir ?
I said, two extra teaspoonfuls of milk never killed the calf's mother.
Pour
There's more milk than water in it, sir.
- More milk, I said
Hey give back my glass
Catch it if you can
Your name sir?
- l'm what you'd call Raj Kapoor Tiwari
Where's your seat here, show me... I'm not on your list...the other one.
I talked to the ticket checker, paid him
Oh, so you've paid him a bribe
No, no...
- Give me your address
Why do you need my address ?
Do you see that berth number ?
Take a look.
- Number seven
Coach FC1 , berth number 7
Always reserved for... the Fursatganj staff going to Lucknow.
I've been using this berth for 3 years
The entire railway division knows that.
How could anyone have given it to you ?
Could you tug that chain for me please ?
Trust Finance Chit Fund Company Loans, chit funds for every need
You think you're the first person to come up with this idea ?
We spend eight hours a day in offices like this, chewing tobacco, eh ?
200 out of every 1 00 finance companies dream of a scheme like this... but trip over their own two feet... trying to find 500 investors to chip in a thousand rupees each
The answer to my next question is on your face but... I'll ask you anyway...
Mister, where are your 500 investors ?
What if I tell you I have them ?
Where...?
Here
I've slogged it out for a whole year, sir i've gotten together 500 investors from my town and the neighbouring ones... willing to put up a thousand rupees each in any good finance company
Where are you from?
Fursatganj
Fursatganj !
Where I was once
Not one finance company... will waste five minutes over a list like this one
Talk of investments
Small town-guys have a habit of dreaming big.
No ban on dreaming indulge yourself
But next time, come up with a scheme that... a thousand others haven't thought up before you.
Get it ?
Now excuse me
Where are you going, lady?
- To enter the contest
You can't go in.
- lf l can't go inside... how do I take part in the competition?
Let me in. I've come really far I said, you can't go in.
- l say, I have to enter
Can I help you ?
- Yes, myself Vimmi Saluja... I've come to enter the contest.
- You're too late
What...?
- The entries closed two days ago
You mean the contest's begun?
- No, not yet
Oh, that's a relief.
- l said, entries have closed
But the contest hasn't begun!
- l said "the-entries-have-closed"
So open up for two minutes, I'll quickly squeeze in !
You're from some village?
Miss Quickly-squeeze-in !
This is no village fair to squeeze-in-slip-out when-you-wish
This is the Miss India contest, but what would you know ?
Oh c'mon Pammi, forget it
One minute... would I know what ?
- The desire and the ability... to become Miss India are two very different things.
So go home... and start a beauty parlour.
- Why not beauty-parlour yourself ?
Excuse me ?
Ever watched your figure ?
At least ten kilos overweight... with black-dyed hair and desperately-curving-lipline... with miles-thick lipstick.
You know all about make-up.
Beauty parlour's for you
What a bitch
Listen...
Yes?
- Please come with me to the toilet lt's right at the end of the platform and it's really dark
Come
Weren't you on the Jhansi Mail this morning ?
Returning?
Here on business?
- Yes I came for the Miss India contest
So how was it ?
Good... very good I got through the first round
Good... good...
Miss India !
And you ?
Here on business too?
- Oh no... no...
Work is something I don't really believe in I came here for a meeting
There's a finance company here, they want to buy my scheme I had to come personally you see, it's a matter of millions
So, you're becoming a model soon?
- l guess so
You'll become famous.
- Yes...
I guess so
People will buzz around you like bees around honey
Yes...
I guess they will
Why are you crying ?
I didn't mean to insult you
No, don't take me otherwise I belong to a decent family, I wouldn't dream of it
Calm down, everyone's watching
Poor thing... she's in grieving I was only sympathising...
Everything's fine
You'll be the first girl to cry after making it to the Miss India contest
I didn't make it anywhere
Aren't you ashamed of lying ?
Actually, I lied too... the manager of the finance company didn't quite buy my scheme... I think he doesn't have the drive
Bloody idiot
Foulmouthing... me...?
Escort her to the loo and then get abused for it ?
I escorted you !
Who do you think you are ?
You mean if you go back now...?
- Wedding bells...
That's too bad.
- Very
Then ?
I'll run away.
- You already have
So, what'll you do now?
- What'll you do ?
Whatever I do, I'm not giving up.
And I'm not going back home
Then, where will you go?
- Kanpur
Why Kanpur?
- The company has a head office there I'll show my scheme to senior officers, I'm sure they'll get it
Why don't you come along to Kanpur?
- Who me...?
Miss India contests are held all over.
Maybe they'll allow you to enter there
You got to find a way into the contest, else what use was running away ?
So long, I guess the next time I see you it'll be on TV I guess so.
Thank you.
And good luck for your big meeting
Thanks but that was superfluous. I only need to make a presentation and... voila !
I'll have 1 00 finance companies running rings around me
See you
Unbelievable.
Got to admit...
very few people have brains as sharp I say, just once in a whole year, let me meet just one such person
But two in a single day, unbelievable!
Would you believe... just half an hour ago, another man came to me with an identical scheme
Who?
- Manager of our Lucknow branch...
Mr Qureishi !
Imagine... a rare gem lay buried in my own backyard
He got a 1 0,000 bonus on the spot !
He even had a list of 500 investors
Unbelievable !
What a man !
- Where's he staying ?
Landmark Hotel.
- ln Landmark !
And why not ?
The 1 0,000 bonus !
Give me as much I'll go to live in a five star too
Next?
- Vimmi Saluja
Address?
- 2/5 Ballygunj, Pankinagar
One minute...
Doesn't Pankinagar fall within the Lucknow district ?
It does?
- Yes, Lucknow district
You didn't fill up the form in Lucknow?
- What difference, here or there ?
I was passing through Kanpur so I thought I'll get it over with
Very good
Please step outside
Sir'ji, just a matter of an address...
- Go away !
Rules are rules
Please...
- Get lost
Oversmartness
Look, I can't bend the rules
But if you wish... I can forget rules for a while
Yes sir!
- But nothing comes for free
Sir, I'll do whatever you wish !
Very good!
Once you're Miss India... you'll have all the wealth, all the fame your heart ever desired
But I?
I'm still stuck to the same ... chair and table
Oh sure... I have nothing right now...
but I promise, when I'm Miss India... I'll pay you...
everything you'll ever want
You're mistaken.
You have everything I'll ever want... right now I won't force you.
Registration closes in five minutes.
Think it over
You'll find me at the same table
What's your name?
- Jajjan
You make tea?
- No, I serve tea
This world we live in boy, has two kinds of people
One, those who serve tea.
And those to whom tea is served
The faster you become one of the latter, the better the life that you'll live
Has somebody hurt you ?
Two teas and chips
Two?
Why ?
Problem ?
- No.
But who's the second cup for?
If I drink two cups, will it start a war?
God, this world we live in...!
Get a hold on this kid
It's no use.
- What ?
No use being earnest, unwitting fools getting shoved in stinking little towns
Then...?
- Bombay... the only city in all of India where a man is recognised for his worth... the only place where you can start from the pavement and end up in palaces... where ambition isn't pushed around, but cheered, egging you on
How're you so sure?
- How... if Dhirubhai Ambani, Ratan Tata, Birla had been in Lucknow-Kanpur... they'd be swatting flies in Ambani General Stores, Tata Flour Mills
And Birla Tobacco Stall.
Bombay...
gave them the recognition they deserved
Look where it got them...
So you want to go Bombay ?
You can come along too.
What'll you do here ?
All the top models are in Bombay.
Damn this narrow-minded small-town mob lt's the place for Miss India, no?
- Yes
A ticket to Bombay, how much would it cost ?
Not that I have that kind of cash
I got the cash, don't worry.
- What...?
We've seen where truth has landed us.
Now let's say what they want to hear
And what's that...?
- Oi Jajjan, where's Landmark Hotel ?
One whiskey...
- Which one sir ?
Imported.
How much for a Black Label?
- Four hundred, sir
For a bottle ?
- No. 30 ml
Small peg I'll try an Indian whiskey for a change.
And don't forget the peanuts
Some pretty suave people you got walking into this Gazal Bar
One Black Label
Sir
Sir !
You here ?
Fursatganj !
All of Lucknow seems to be pouring into Kanpur today
Slick !
What are you doing here ?
- You'll be seeing more of me here
What do you mean ?
- My scheme got rocking
Which... the same one ?
- No... it was unworkable
You tipped me off in time.
I could've wasted another good year
This is another scheme.
- Which is this ?
I explained this scheme, they offered me a two per cent stake in the channel
What channel...?
- A news channel
News channel
Nowadays this news channel business is taking off like a rocket ln 3 months, they're giving investors a 300 per cent return on investment
Cigarette ?
- Really ?
How much... is the investment ?
- At least 1 00,000
Won't they take a little less ?
I mean, I could invest too...?
Why don't you have a chat ?
Give me an introduction
This is Mr Qureishi
- Q.Q.Qureishi
Q.Q.Qureishi, a very dear friend.
Whatever I am today is because of him
Mr Qureishi would like to invest in the channel
How many millions ?
He's not like other investors...
this is just a friendly gesture... about ten thousand ?
- Ten
Ten...?
Fifteen... ?
But you're aware, it should be at least...
Ok, all right, now how can I refuse you ?
One request, this remains between us ... let this be our little secret
No, no... !
- Promise
We must be in Delhi by morning
So you take the cash from him... and fetch us a receipt from my room ln the meantime, if he has no objections Mr Qureishi can give me company
Yes ?
Well ?
- No...
I mean no problem
Ten ?
Fursatganj, don't forget the receipt
Would you like to dance with me Mr Q.Q.Qureishi ?
You dance really well.
- Thank you
Where's the ladies' room ?
- Thank you
The washroom... where is it ?
- Bartender, where's the washroom ?
Run
What d'you think of my acting ?
Better than yours ?
Who conned him to your table ?
- Who made the sucker dance ?
I'd love to see Q.Q.Qureishi dancing
Hey, the cash
Some sample
Your share.
- You keep it lt's your share.
- Not a gift
Just bank it for me till Bombay.
I can't manage money
We had fun though, no ?
Lots...
Move it.
Sit in the bus
Passengers for Dehradun and Ambala, your bus is leaving
Name ?
- Bunty
And the Mrs ?
Babli
Bunty...
Babli... seats 2 1 and 22
Get inside
Bunty...
Babli... what the hell...?
- Nothing... move on. 2 1 and 22
What do you mean nothing?
- Sit down, I'll explain
When I was a kid I always blamed Bunty for all the mischief I did
And we've just stolen money.
So...
- But... what the hell is Babli ?
Why, what's wrong ?
I don't have a problem with Bunty
You look like your Bunty !
But Babli... she sounds like a fat slob
Fat or thin, now it's sealed.
- You could've asked me
Ask my wife her name in front of a bus conductor ?
Who are you calling your wife ?
- l didn't say that, he thought so
And you let it pass !
Now everyone in this bus thinks I'm Bunty's wife
What are you doing ?
Everyone will think Bunty's wife is a shrew
Stop it !
- You stop it I'm not talking.
- Suits me
Babli, big deal
At least we managed enough to get us to Bombay
This stash won't last us a week in Bombay
And...?
And...
I think we'll need lots more if we want to make it in Bombay
Where will we get so much money ?
- The same place we got this from
You mean another... ?
Are you mad ?
What are you saying ?
- l'm not saying a thing.
Bunty is
And I'm doing what Bunty's saying ?
- Who are you to do ?
Babli will
Babli ?
But I am Babli !
- Sure
You are when you are
You aren't when you aren't
Say, what are you now...?
Bunty.
You...?
Babli...?
TmG
Babli Bose, Food Inspector.
I'll inspect your kitchen
We hear, the beer is adulterated here.
- Tony, a chilled beer for the sahib
One step, two step, he steps it up swings it, pumps it, struts his stuff
Meet Bunty
Minute by minute, she turns it up spins it so you can't get enough
Meet Babli
Spinning like tops, orchestrating rip-offs... they'll clean your pockets, cock a snook and be off
There ain't a legit soul from who they never stole
When they dig, they dig so deep you can't get out of that hole
Bunty Saluja, Tourism department.
Unclean rooms.
Got to inspect
Unclean ?
How many days of inspection ?
- Three
Bunty And Babli
They maybe two... but they're too much
Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch
Consider it your's
Take it away... fly away, she's yours
What model number is this ?
- Model number can take a hike !
Why isn't your man back yet ?
- What man ?
Man... means husband.
- Husband !
What crap.
You bloody fool
Love is wild like pigeon wings
Tantrums trip on diamond rings
Don't you blink
You might see their shadows pass
Tea cups clink.
Tea cups crash.
Forgive, forget, they have a fight... wipe their mouths and take full flight... come, come, come on, come on, one step, two step, swing it Bunty
Bulandshahr is abuzz with the amusing misadventures... of this daring duo who call themselves Bunty and Babli
People seem to be in awe of their ingenuity and audacity
Would you like a room or a suite ?
No, I don't want just a room I want the hotel...
we're here to buy this place I never thought I'd sell this place.
But your strong background... and this mind blowing offer...
I'd have to be a lunatic to refuse
How long are you here ?
A week maybe...
- Stay here then... as our guests
This hotel's as good as yours.
We'll discuss details over the weekend
No, doesn't look good.
We can't stay before we've signed the dotted line I won't take no for an answer
Well if you insist... champagne ?
Searched every inch of Mussoorie sir, I can't find them
What do you mean ?
And their stuff ?
- They even stole ours
Damn them
Come away, come away
All our sparkles fly right across the sky
Then we sight the morning light Float up high
Witness the magic of Guru'ji
People running after you like this ... it's a heady feeling
What...?
- Makes me feels like I'm an achiever
They walk wrapped in perfume mists
Hold the world in love-locked fists
You won't see them flit about till they want you to, and when you do... he slides with a swagger.
- He's Bunty
She glides zig-zagger.
- She's Babli
Their tales are lore...
been told a score times and more
And will be sung forever more I can't see any tunnel here...
- We've paid a hundred bucks apiece
Where's that Bunty guide ?
Spinning like tops, orchestrating rip-offs... they'll clean your pockets, cock a snook and be off... there ain't a legit soul from who they never stole... and they dig so deep you can't get out that hole

She turns it on, spins it so you can't get enough.
Oye Babli
Bunty Aur Babli Bunty and Babli
They maybe two but they're too much Tough-2-catch, too fast-2-touch
I'm so hungry I can't think straight
And you will shut up and eat whatever's available.
No tantrums
Makes you cry ?
What's to cry about ?
- None of your business
Look, what I meant was you can't get pizzas out here
All right, I'll get whatever you feel like
Tell me what you want
Who...?
- l want my mummy
But... out here...?
I miss her
You miss her a lot ?
Go on, get it over with

Not over !
I'm missing her, not laying an egg !
Over !
What do you miss ?
When I was little...
Papa'ji would talk about taking us for a holiday, far away from Pankinagar
But in all my years of waiting, we never saved up enough for a holiday
You want to send some money home ?
Do you want to call them ?
Come...
No one's saying anything
Then why are you wasting your breath ?
- l don't know why...
I think it's Vimmi
Who's this ?
Some nut
Papa'ji lt's me...
Papa'ji
Vimmi, my child...
where did you disappear ?
I'm okay Papa, I'm fine
Vimmi my child, where are you ?
I can't tell Mummy, but I'm fine
Look dear...
No Papa'ji, don't ask me to come back now...
I don't want to come back
But I really love both of you
No, my child, listen to me...
- No Papa'ji. I'm hanging up now
Bye... I love you both very much
You want to call home too ?
No
Folks at home must be worried about you too
No one worries about me
What are you doing here ?
Wondering where he's now ... how he's doing
Do you think I was too harsh on him ?
- You were right in whatever you did
Have your tea, it's time to go to work
Enough ?
Satisfied ?
If you manage money like this in Bombay in no time, you'll be back... in your punk-whatever-town.
- Pankinagar, you bloody idiot
Wherever, but you're finished.
- What's left to count ?
You've blown it all up.
- l have, have I...?
Expensive dresses, shoploads of makeup just fell out of the sky ?
They came from the same place as your watch, designer shirt, jeans... and... this deodorant that smells like turnip pickle gone bad
They fell off the sky, they did
Now what ?
I've been thinking...
Let's... do it one more time ?
- No... we've pooled enough to get us to Bombay.
- Vimmi this world we live in... has two kinds of people.
One...
those who collect enough and those... who'll never have enough.
Myself and Tata-Birla-Ambanis are the other kind
That's why they're where they are today.
And once we're in Bombay... we won't get another chance.
So...
let's take one last crack.
Just once more
You think so ?
I know so.
So I say so
Who says so ?
You or Bunty ?
- Bunty's always saying so
Today a little of me is with Bunty.
- Oye Rakesh... my sweet bloody idiot
This one.
- No problem
There's just one problem
Just tell me.
- l'm leaving for Mussoorie tonight
Oh, that is a beautiful place - l know
Tomorrow I have an inauguration.
- Your inauguration ?
Not mine... my hotel's
Oh, I see
Look Mrs...
- Miss...
Miss... earliest we can deliver would be by tomorrow morning lt's closing time, you see ?
And we can't stay open for one machine
No, no... not one machine.
- Then ?
All.
- All...?
But if the mall isn't open...
- No...
I'll open up myself...
I mean... I'll open it up myself for you
Lovely
Sixty thousand
You take cash don't you ?
- l take anything you say
Let's shop
Easy brother, easy.
The stuff inside is real precious
Sorry for troubling you so much.
- You can trouble me as much as you wish
Please visit our hotel sometime.
- Sure
Your machines are now yours
Here's the balance amount
Thank you very much
- Mention not
May God send customers like you my way every day I pray we come by shops like yours everyday
I have the same...
We seem to share similar tastes.
- l wish we find more in common
Mehmood !
Let her rip.
- You sound like he's after us already lf he isn't, then he soon will
Oye Bunty, you gave him a licking ?
300,000 worth of shades
400,000 in watches
700,000 in electronic items
Deal
Time for a Chinese lunch.
Come I can't count any more
The incredible incident at the renowned Center One Mall in Bareilly... has confounded the police.
Sources say, the perpetrators of this heist are...
Bunty and Babli whose capers have already made headlines in many cities
Even as investigations proceed, by now Bunty and Babli must be far far away
Tomorrow morning !
Bombay.
- That soon ?
Before you've brushed your teeth.
This train gets there like a bullet
Good.
We can get to work the minute we get there
You're hunting for the top models ?
- Like you're catching your Tata-Birlas
Your share
Always splitting cash at the drop of a hat ?
What's with you ?
Let's just get it over with, no ?
So tomorrow... you get on with your life, I'll get on with mine
What'll you do without me ?
I mean, on your own... in Bombay ?
Hog the whole bathroom ?
You'll have complete freedom too, no ?
Nobody will be getting on your nerves
Well you didn't bug me that much.
- Really now ?
The way you fought, I would have to be the meanest man in the world I can't believe, by tomorrow morning I'll be in Bombay
All these dreams, all these years...
is everything finally coming true ?
Flap your wings, come on let's fly
Flap your wings, let's taste the sky
TmG
Balle-Balle on a Sundae-Sunday
Flap your wings, come on let's fly.
Flap your wings, let's taste the sky
Let's set the streets of Juliet on fire.
Dance with Romeo in the streets of desire
We explode with the light
Burn the dance floor, girl
Nach Baliye Dance the Balle
Want bangles on your wrist, love ?
- Nach Baliye
Want jewels in your hair, love ?
- Nach Baliye
Run anklets around your feet, love ?
- Nach Baliye
Give me bangles on my wrist, love
Weave jewels into my hair, love
Run anklets around my feet, love
Love to watch you baby, turn around
The red carpet of dreams unfurls for us to walk on
Fate's now a little toy, to toss, to roll, to rock on
Take your bets now, gamble your life.
Fate's at my feet.
Ready to ride ?
Then come... take my hand, love... I'll give you the ride of your life
Then take my hand, love... give me the ride of my life
Let's set the streets of Juliet on fire, dance with Romeo in the streets of desire
We explode with the light
Burn the dance floor, girl
Dance the Balle
Clap your hands everybody, everybody just clap your hands
Day doesn't sink into night here
These roads stay awake, alight here
Tip-toeing upon my eyelids are dreams that never sleep
Then take my hand, love... I'll give you the ride of your life
Attention
Train from Delhi to Bombay is arriving on platform 36 instead of platform 1 2
Bunty-Babli's largesse for the poor Con duo named in several heists
Bombay's really crowded, no ?
Everyone's here to make their dreams come true, no ?
What's this stench ?
Must be fish, no...?
Where do you think fashion shows happen here ?
Let's get you into a taxi
- And... you ?
I'm going back.
- What !
Look, I don't want to stay in Bombay.
- What do you mean ?
I just... wanted to be really famous...
a name to be reckoned with... a name in the headlines
Vimmi, for the first time in my life I think I have a talent no one else has
I realise now, I never was Rakesh.
I've always been Bunty... I've always enjoyed being him
To tell you the truth, I never had the perseverance it takes... to become a Tata or Ambani, nor the calibre
Anyway, doesn't matter now.
I think I've discovered my destination
And I'm on my way towards it
Look... this is what I want to do... all my life, freely
But you please become a model, a supermodel... so take care
All this... you did it all alone ?
That's not what I meant.
- Then...?
Without you...
- You can't walk one step, you know ?
Wants himself in headlines !
Who wants to read about you ?
No one's interested in reading or publishing a Bunty-minus-Babli
Truth is... without me, you could've done nothing and you never will
Your taxi...
Tell me... can you ?
Yes
No
Can you live without me ?
Yes
Then why are you screaming taxi-taxi ?
- Because you need to go
Yes...
- So tell me... where ?
Where you want to go
Who says so ?
You or Babli ?
What do you think ?
Must be you
So will you do something about it ?
If that's the case then I must do something about it, no ?
What the hell !
I didn't mean that
Wasn't me. lt was Bunty.
- Everyone's staring
We're in Bombay.
No one looks at anyone here
Think it over I won't let you rule over the bathroom.
- Done
No more sleeping alone on the floor.
- Sounds good
What about all the modelling dreams ?
- That's Vimmi's problem
But you...?
- l've become Babli
Forever
You know what it's worth ?
Not five paise. lt's a fake
Who...?
- What...?
What's your name?
Mehmood
You're a comedian ?
Let's start by making you laugh ?
Okay, two jokes for you 769 01:16:07,822 -- 01:16:08,413 One
Mrs and Mr Flea come out after a matinee show
Mrs Flea says, I'm tired today
Mr Flea says, honey don't worry, I'll hail us a dog
You are that dog...
the one they rode for the hike
Now spill it, did you go to Center One that night or no ?
No sir
This here, is my second joke 777 01:16:52,800 -- 01:16:54,143 Where are those two now ?
Long time... gone
Names...?
Bunty y Babli
How old are they ?
Bunty's around 23-24
Babli is 20-21
She was really sweet, well mannered and intelligent, sir
Even the boy was all heart, great guy
That's quite something, sir
No, you asses are quite something
To think that petty criminals... booked for cheating, misdemeanour, malfeasance, fraud and perjury... are quite something
And not just you, the whole lot of you from this generation is quite something
Right and wrong, good esteem and bad, good deeds and bad... you've forgotten what sets them apart
But I can tell the difference.
And I'm going to teach you fools too
The newspapers say that for boys and girls in schools and colleges... these two crooks are role models.
- So they want to be role models ?
Fine... then that's what they'll become... I'll make them a fine example of a cure for this generation
What did you say their names were ?
- Bunty and Babli
This Bunty-Babli better watch out for me
We'll never ever cheat on each other
We'll always place each other before ourselves
OK
We'll never ever break each other's hearts
And if we do so accidentally, we won't burst into tears without warning
Okay, we will never eat or drink anything without each other
Except early morning tea
You wake up like a queen at noon I can't wait that long
We'll give each other the same amount of love forever
Why ?
We can give more !
I'll love you even more tomorrow... more the day after and so much more the day after the day after
We'll cut off all ties with those who don't understand us
Except our parents.
- Your parents
We'll be Bunty-Babli for the rest of our lives
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except...
Except...?
- Leave that to me okej
Now the groom may kiss the bride !
- Oye Rakesh just married !
Look... right at the outset of this marriage I want to tell you all about my past
I don't want any issues later ln school, when I was in Class Two, Mukesh used to sit behind me
He used to tug at my plaits
And you know...
it used to make me giggle like crazy
These boys are all scoundrels
They'll try their luck with every cute girl
How true
How lucky l am, you aren't like those boys
Rakesh... you're such a good boy
Sweet boy
So... what I was saying was...
now that you are my wife... my mate in joy and sorrow... for all my days to come... and nights... understand ?
Asleep ?
On your wedding night !
This world we live in has two kinds of people... those who aren't married and those who are
So...?
So you belong to the latter, no ?
So?
So marry me now you fool
TMG
The clouds have torn
My sky has flown I see my skies breaking free of the earth at the horizon... soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit... soft, slow, tip-toeing my love
Do you see what I see...
the earth flows like a river... earth in water, water in earth dissolve and begin to shiver
Then my sky breaks free of the earth at the horizon
No consciousness of what I am I have no sense of what I'll be
This time now seems unreal This can't be happening to me
You slowly dissolve in me I slowly fade into you
Our feet stop, pick up a dream Our paths shift, it's coming true
The sky turns over lazily on it's cloud bed lt just might melt, rain down to kiss the ground
The earth dips its toe tips in a water well lt just might find feet roll up, start walking around... soft, slow, on tip-toe bit by thieving bit...
Say the word and I stop.
Say the other and I move lf this is madness that consumes me, let it be a madness too
Say the word and I stop.
Say the other and I move
A stranger to my destinations I go where you want me to
Soft, bit by thieving bit
Softly, my love
Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's Each other's forever they'll be
Babli is Bunty's and Bunty is Babli's Each other's forever they'll be
Each other's forever...
- They'll be
They began their lives... in small sleepy towns, towns they detested
Not for poverty, need or misfortune.
Only for fun
Turning to crime for fun?
I'd never ever heard that before
News of Bunty-Babli's capers poured in from all quarters... dripping into my ears like red hot molten iron
Girls and boys in schools and colleges began to idolize them as new age heroes
Constantly breathing down their necks, I even started to think like them... what next, their next sharp turn...?
My hunches were hitting bull's eye... and I was inching closer to them with every passing day
They took their infamy for success and quickly jumped from cons to scams
Scams no one had ever heard of or imagined before
Okay, how about Kerala ?
- Too hot
Manali ?
- No, it is too cold
Jaipur ?
- lt's too dusty
Ladakh ?
- lt's too lonely, Harry
How many times am I gonna tell you, it's a damn historical monument... not a hotel which I can rent
That's your problem Harry, you said if we came to India... I could get married wherever I want.
This is what I want
You are impossible
Am I...
I am ?
- Yes
Really ?
Fine !
- Yes
Do you see what I see?
- l'm not blind
Do you hear what I hear ?
- l'm not deaf
Are you thinking what I'm thinking ?
- l'm no mind reader.
Get to the point
Protesters... thirty.
Taxi drivers...?
- Four
School children ?
- Twenty.
With one teacher
Newspaper ?
- Agra Times
Minister's office.
- Very good !
And a wedding bash.
- Oye Rakesh !
A first round knockout
I want to marry there Harry, not put it in my living room I told you it's not possible Kate
Selling Taj...
- Never, never
Government don't be...

Extremely sorry sir, I apologise
Today's newspaper sir ?
Thank you so much, sir

- Yes sir
By who ?
By him, sir
Excuse me
Hold on
No sir, it is not possible.
We cannot sell Taj Mahal to a foreigner
Even if the price is high ?
- No price is too high for Taj Mahal
How about 100 million dollars?
- No sir 1 50 million.
- No sir
175 million.
- Sir, I told you, it's not possible 200 million.
- Well... 250 milion
Why don't you speak with her?
- Who ?
Phoolsakhi-ji
Who is Phoolsakhi-ji?
Minister in charge of purchase and selling of the Taj Mahal
Where's the typist ?
She's down with viral fever.
We're getting another typist
Get her quickly.
- l'll be in the office all day today
Let's pack in as much corruption as we can today
Of course.
- The typist is here madam'ji
Sit !
My niece's doctoral thesis.
I want it typed out by this evening
Of course, it's me.
Go on
What...
I'm coming right away
What's the matter ma'am ?
- Riot outside my house !
Hurry !
You keep typing I'll be back in an hour
How long have you been in government ?
- Not very long
And the minister ?
- Not very long either
Sir...
You brought the other money ?
I can't believe !
Someone is actually selling the Taj Mahal
Nor can I believe !
Someone is actually buying
This ass is going to get kicked
Crowshit on your egghead
He'll be crying for help in two days
How do I look ?
- Very fine
How are you madam ?
Would you believe I've been dying to see you ?
Madam, this is Mr Harry Epstein
He wants to buy the Taj Mahal
Exactly I'm not selling
But madam, we had a deal...
- Why are you late ?
But ma'am...
Shut up !
So you can't sell the Taj Mahal to me ?
It's all a big mistake
And you have wasted my time
One minute
I said I can't sell the Taj Mahal but it doesn't mean you can't have it I don't understand
You can lease it on rent
For how long ?
Five years
Ten
Lease document ready for five.
interested, not interested ?
Interested, interested
Why are you protesting ?
- Because we have grievances
What grievances ?
- Meet our demands or else
What demands ?
The revolution...
- Long live the revolution
Never mind that, but what are your demands ?
Down with tyranny
Whose...?
- Every tyrant's
Five years
All Harry Epstein's
For a price of 250 million dollars.
- Good doing business with you
And here is your fee 5 million Rupees, cash
Tell me your demands.

Quit India, quit India
Quit India...?
- State your demands or I'll arrest you
We demand that Ms Kalasakhi...
- But I'm Phoolsakhi !
Tell them !
- You've got the address wrong
She is Ms Phoolsakhi.
Now get out.
- Okay.
Sorry.
Fine.
Relax.
Don't mind
Okay then, goodbye.
- Thank you madam
See you.
- Namaste
Which country are you from ?
- Oh, all of them
Your guests should be here soon
Goodbye
What happened to this elevator ?
- Could be stuck somewhere lt's coming.
- Let's go
Finished ?
- Nearly
It sure is nice of Mr Bunty to throw us this wonderful wedding party
And you !
Thank you, it's a dream come true
Not possible
What do you mean not-possible, I own the Taj Mahal ls he nuts ?
He says he owns the Taj Mahal !
Poor thing, God can really be cruel sometimes
Open the gate before I fire you ... dismiss you
Dismiss ?
He says he'll get us dismissed
Doctor ?
You need one ?
We call doctor ?
No doctor !
You talk to Mr Bunty
He wants some Bunty fellow
What Bunty...?
Hey wait a minute are they Bunty and Babli ?
So finally you arrive !
They sold the Taj and scooted while you stood by and watched it happen ?
Tomorrow when you sell it again I'll still be left watching
What !
- Look madam... a bull doesn't budge until he sees red in his face... and it takes a scam to prod me into action. I just got the news, no ?
That's no way to talk.
- Really ?
And how did they talk ?
Go on, file your report about descriptions, characteristics
Stop staring at me and do it
No one could've pulled off this caper without the help of insiders
Who could it be ?
- Could've been you, madam
You left her alone in the room at a perfect time
Corruption happens at the top floor.
But one has to climb from the ground floor
There's a saying amongst us policemen.
Orderlies make more under the table
See son... you shouldn't have gone to the wedding, that too in a new car.
Getting it ?
Hey trumpet
Yes sir ?
What's the most requested song nowadays ?
Babu'ji, slow it down now
Stand up here
Play
I heard you took an American to his wedding altar
No, sir i know their names.
I want to know where they are
Harry says, he was so smooth, and convincing.
Harry's no fool
And you believed ?
- l did lt was in the Times of India.
- All newspapers say... all Americans have sex all the day, I believe ?
Don't look at it, you hear me ?
Don't look at it
Sir how about leaving ?
What can we possibly get to know here ?
Here you learn to what lengths a man can go... for the smallest of things
Get the serial numbers of the currency that he withdrew from his bank
Tell me joke
Non-veg
Tired of turning wheels ?
Now watch how the wheels of fortune turn I didn't see a thing.
What can I say?
I'm a simple honest man
God !
This one turns out to be honest!
Wheel back that car... go on... back out... go away, far away
There.
Stop
The longer the distance, the more it looks like an accident
Don't move or I'll shoot.
- Sir, what are you saying ?
I told you !
I saw nothing.
- No one's ever seen... what's about to happen right now
Come on, slam the car.
- No... please
Slam him.
- Please !
No... I saw, I saw!
I saw everything
Turn off the engine
Stand straight
See no evil.
Speak no evil.
Hear no evil but if you can profit, grab it
Gandhi'ji would've come here personally to whack you for being so honest
Who else was in it with them?
Go on, give him every detail
What's wrong ?
Why are you sulking?
You're upset with me ?
Moron, the Taj got sold, not your taxi.
Like some nuts ?
No ?
Suit yourself
There was no corner of the country Bunty and Babli hadn't been to
And every newspaper was cheering their ingenuity
But I was dying to see them behind bars 6 MONTH LATER
No there's no mistake about this order.
Your assignment is being changed
But I've completely committed myself to the case
Bunty-Babli's case is being assigned to the federal agencies
To whom ?
- Federal investigation
God !
Our politicians have become honest?
The feds have time for Bunty and Babli ?
They have your sympathies?
- Not those two
My sympathies are with the feds.
- You think the feds can't get them ?
Why ?
- Because they can't think like them
And you can?
I'm beginning to feel we're related somehow
From tomorrow, you're taking charge of the gold at the airport
Very well sir
You're the boss I'll take charge of hell if you want me to
Anyway what's the score?
- What ?
I found myself a night-watchman's job.
This is how I got to bide my time
Dashrath Singh... lf there's anybody who'll lay a finger on Bunty and Babli, it's me
You find this funny ?
You can do this yourself the next time I won't be able to do this even if I tried, love
But you can make a mockery of those who do ?
Ok, I'm sorry
- What idiot could've made you a father
You
One rum, large
You don't need to pay sir
Did I mention I'm a policeman?
- Hear me out, sir
The gentleman out there is hosting food and drinks for all guests tonight
Who...?
- The man in black
They're buying this restaurant
No way.
We're picking up the tab for everyone tonight
Not tonight.
Tomorrow
From tomorrow, this hotel is yours to do as you please.
But tonight's on me
Friends, cocktails and dinner for everyone on the house
Vodka
Whiskey
Cocktail?
Gin
Rum
Flying to the moon?
- You're selling the tickets ?
You've just bought yourself a one-way ticket I don't believe much in buying tickets but yes, I do want to fly to the moon
You're a man in a hurry?
Somewhat
There's this one place in which men-in-a-hurry usually end up
You see...
- What ?
This world we live in has two kinds of people I see.
- One, the kind that listens
And the kind that talks.
I belong to the latter
So sure of yourself ?
What do you do?
- Cleaning l'm in the cleaning business.
We clean out places
What kind of places ?
- Any kind
So you like tidy places?
- No, I like tidy sums of money
Interesting man.
Where are you from?
- Allahabad
Aha, you look that type
Sir, one more large ?
Bring it on then
What's happening here ?
You're smoking in front of your baby?
- How the hell can he see me ?
Babies know everything.
- How can they know everything ?
Stop it !
I get the feeling I'm her baby
And he who is he ?
I... am...
- He is...
Whoever, doesn't matter.
Come on
Women... are like this only.
- How and how do you think women are ?
Oye, don't stoke my anger.
- Hello, what's happening here ?
A fight can't you see?
- That I can, but why ?
Private matters of husband-wife!
How meddlesome !
Please stub that out
You look like a long lost father!
Ought to be setting an example for him
And you better come along.
I'm checking out the rooms in this hotel
Don't take too long
Don't come back in an hour or two.
Spoilt the mood for no rhyme or reason
You seem to be much fallen-in-love
You've never fallen... in love?
Once, a little
What?
A little
In a summer of Delhi l came upon her
Every single day on bus number 481 ... I would fall all over myself to vacate the ladies' seat... and she would sit down with the sweetest smile
For a whole year...
- You never spoke ?
When our eyes were saying so much how could words dare to interfere ?
But... I can shower her with gifts, can't I ?
So every week, I'd fall over myself to give her my gift
And she...
- Would smile ?
And take it
And I'm sure that one day, in return for all my gifts she would give me... that one big gift I've been waiting for.
- So did the gift arrive ?
Winter arrived
On the 2 1 st of December... wrapped in a maroon shawl and a warm smile... she stepped into the bus.
Radiance on her face and in her hands... a Golden Bakery box.
Inside that box... were the world's most beautiful heart shaped... you know... heart-shaped pastries
And then for the first time in a year... she spoke her first words to me
Please... would you distribute these pastries to all the passengers I just got engaged
Ei handsome
- Yeah?
What happened ?
She's calling you
Who is ?
Tonight's your night
Those pangs you feel in your heart have pained me too
Why not drown our pains tonight?
Nice
Rare are those moments in life when desire calls
Come into my arms, or come and slit my throat
Oh forget it... this give and take of hearts takes a lot of heart... and doing it so boldly for the world to see... it's a woman's art you see ln this winning and losing of hearts what are men worth ?
His ruthless gaze... tore up the street... took me apart lt ran a razor's edge down the willing side of my heart
TmG I fall to restless pieces... don't look at me that way I fall to restless pieces, don't look at me that way
A townful of men in ruin surrenders to what I say stretch with desire, I take my bow I stretch with desire... come touch me now
Night eyes... night eyes... your night eyes...
The moon sleeps inside those night eyes
Night eyes, your night eyes Night falls inside those night eyes
Night eyes, my night eyes We are one inside twin night eyes
Night eyes, your night eyes The moon sleeps inside those night eyes
These sighs you swore, wrote them in kohl
Come to life inside these eyes
That kiss you left on my handkerchief I knot it until it dies
Oh your words are wisps from incense bowls
You waft in lazy like the warm wind rolls I bow, I stretch... come touch me I stretch with desire, I take my bow
Night eyes, my night eyes You're a shadow inside my night eyes
These eyes take me by surprise
Ask private questions, brook no lies
Hide under those veil-like lids
The curtains behind which she shies
No curtains hide my pain, no lies try to guard me
I hurt only when she gives her word not to scar me
Night eyes, your night eyes I was stung when I sung to your night eyes
Night eyes, your night eyes The moon sleeps inside my night eyes
You are mine in the memories of old stone cities
Our songs still echo in those forlorn cities
From the south gate arch to where the north gate lies... you and I are lore set in stone cities I hear the call of the saint on the wall
And swear by the black beauty of your eyes I'm the guardian from evil your eyes never had I'll suffuse them with smiles so they never look sad
Our bodies, they ache Our lips, they quake
Come touch me, oh touch me, oh touch me now
Tonight is the night, the night is tonight
Tonight's the night, oh night-eyes I love the way you sway

Madam, I am your only Adam
Night eyes...
oh the dark of her nights in my eyes
Why do you dole out free drinks?
Why give free drinks, you fool!
How will you run your hotel ?
Anyway... I enjoyed your company
I feel satisfied and a little in love
And it helped me forget those two
Forget them... you've nothing to do with those scoundrels
Generally... I don't take to strangers too well
But I don't know... I don't know why the two of you have touched my heart
We've done what...?
- Touched my heart... you could've been my children
You haven't told us your name.
- You haven't told...
My name is Dashrath
Dashrath Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Police
You're a police'wallah?
- What did you think ?
Balloon' wallah?
Why what's come over you ?
What's it ?
- Sir, Rickshaw' wallah...
Sit in the rickshaw
Go on, take him home.
- Yes, take me home lt's very late.
- Very late at night
Take me to the airport ... no not there I'm going to Police Lines.
- Go on, quick
Oh my God, the very same Dashrath Singh the one who's been after us ?
My baby almost had a heart attack!
That was close, let's get out of here
Get out ?
The fun's only just begun
- What are you talking about ?
Look, he never knew what we look like.
He still doesn't.
But now... we know who he is and we also know that... he's in charge of the security of the gold stashed at the airport
By God !
You are...
- Vimmi, if we don't... steal the meat right from the lion's den... what did we achieve?
- Your hunger's getting out of hand
Now we're a threesome.
We'll need more food... what do you say ?
You'll get us killed someday
India's Central Bank doesn't keep it's gold in any one place
To protect the gold from fires, floods or earthquakes... the cache is split over four different cities
Depending on the requirements of various banks... this gold is shuttled by air between these four cities once every week
How they cracked this confidential information, they haven't divulged
But what they did that day no one could have ever imagined
Not even me...
Delhi-Mumbai, 9.1 0 pm tonight.
Korpal, Puneet, Mr
Delhi-Calcutta, 9.40 pm.
Sharma, Vandana, Mrs
What's this other ticket for?
- Backup
Why the Air Traffic Control number?
- Backup
A back up for everything?
Oye Rakesh, is there one for you too ?
Yes
Who ?
You
Smart
Call back the Jet airways flight Mumbai.
The bomb is ticking
What nonsense.
A bomb on the plane ?
Jet 9W31 2.
Yes Delhi Control ?
Turn back and proceed for landing on emergency runway number 2
There is a bomb scare
Delhi Control is this a joke?
Bomb on board, he says
Jet 9W31 2.
Turning back
Which runway?
- Number 2.
Bomb squad is on the runway
The caller's number.
Get it now
Go get the number from them.
Now !
We can't have the number lt isn't under our jurisdiction.
- As long as the gold is on board... this plane, the bomb, this airport, everything is under our jurisdiction
How many people knew about the gold?
- Four bank employees
Are you implying the news was leaked?
- Give me the key to the box
But we are not permitted to open it.
- Give me the key
Now it's your responsibility.
- The bomb might explode any time, sir
The bomb has exploded.
Send message to headquarters. I am assuming command
DCP Dashrath Singh here...
Surround the airport area
Locate persons who do not have any reason to be here at this hour
Take suspects into custody and inform immediately
They received the bomb scare from this number
Dial
Ringing
Orange Maruti Swift 5700
Vimmi we'll have to ditch this car.
They've spotted it.
Get out !
Stop... taxi
Stop... please
Papa'ji, please help us !
I'll give you more money than you ever imagined
Son, for this job, I won't take money even if you give it to me... come my child, get up, you'll do fine
Have faith in god.
Faith prevails
Sir, what are you saying ?
Policemen in every hospital and nursing home ?
We won't have men for policing the city.
- She's in labour.
She's about to deliver
She goes at dar for a moment
Every child born in Delhi tonight will see a policeman's face... before anything else
That Dashrath Singh figured me out.
- How are you so sure?
I know. I saw it in his eyes...
Then... in no time every hospital in Delhi will be crawling with policemen
Which hospital do you want to go to son ?
The biggest...
the biggest hospital in Delhi
Not a hospital or nursing home, they'll go to a nondescript clinic lf l know that Bunty, he'll definitely take Babli to the biggest hospital
Vimmi, don't be afraid
This hospital is packed choc-a-bloc with newborns and their mothers lt'll take them ages to check each bed.
But you please hurry it up lt isn't in my hands, bloody idiot !
I told you you'll get us killed someday
Hush
But hey, what life did I have before I met you ?
is everything all right?
- Yes
Papa'ji... if you weren't here today...
- There would have been someone else
The Lord up there runs a regular courier service
He always provides for ones in need
Where are you going ?
You can't go in
Pointless... he must've taped the gate downstairs.
Walk
Those two have fled the hospital but they haven't fled Delhi yet
Seal Delhi, sir
Papa'ji, all that you've done for us...
- One honest man would do for another
Papa'ji, you're kidding me
By now you must have figured that we aren't half as honest as we seem
I don't know what you've done to make these people hunt you down... but I see a simple honesty in your eyes... take care son.
God bless you
For the next week or so they'll be baying for our blood
We'll return afterwards... but where have you hidden the gold ?
What's your baby, a boy or a girl ?
What will you name your baby ?
Before you think of a name you need to see the baby at least ?
A day has gone by, have you even taken one look at your baby ?
Did you hold your child in your arms, even once... once even ?
Vimmi, you know we didn't have any time for these.
Had I stopped for all this... all three of us would've either been jailed or killed by now
Some reason for celebration !
The day he is born... his parents die
Cursed fate to be born with !
- Not his fault, is it ?
That's what I'm saying!
What wrong has he done... to deserve parents who can go to jail anytime... leaving him to rot on the streets
What are you trying to say?
- Enough I won't do this anymore.
Neither will you...
Then what else can we do?
- Anything, whatever everyone else does lf we had to end up doing what everybody else does... why did we ever run away from home?
- Because we were wrong
Now we're not free to live as we like.
Now we're responsible for one more life
How's he going to grow up?
- How ?
With us, that's how
With us?
And which school will he go to ?
You know this world we live in has two kinds of people.
One... who waste the best years of their lives in schools and colleges.
And... the kind who school themselves.
Like us.
We taught us to do what we're doing
Which is what he'll learn?
- Of course !
And then he'll go to jail someday?
- Have we ever been to jail?
We very nearly got thrown into jail I don't want my son growing up behind bars... or dying young on the run
Do you remember agreeing on all our marriage vows except...
We'll be Bunty-Babli for the rest of our lives
And we'll live out all our dreams.
- Except...
Except...?
- Leave that to me
Okay
This is the exception Rakesh
You're getting over-emotional about this motherhood business
But now I am whatever I am.
Now I want to hear your decision
Choose. it's either this life ... or a life together
So what have you decided?
What'll I do without the two of you ?
Those marriage vows weren't mere words
Fursatganj or Pankinagar?
is it you that's saying this or... ?
Bunty and Rakesh.
-Both
What ?
Tickets
Since when are we buying tickets ?
- From today
Why become so damn honest ?
Oye Rakesh, you're in love
Oh all right
Rakesh my boy, this world we live in has two kinds of men.
One... the kind that thinks twice before getting married
And the kind that thinks afterwards like you, you idiot
Two tickets for Fursatganj
Name ?
Rakesh Trivedi, Vimmi Trivedi
Bunty and Babli
You've had a long run.
You must be tired
Can we have some water ?
Die of thirst dog !
Not for me.
For the two of them
You won't believe me but we quit being crooks half an hour ago
Absolutely right, I won't believe you.
- But if I insist I'm telling the truth ?
I'll start doing right now what I had planned to do to you in jail
Why are you looking at me like that ?
- He's telling the truth
Guaranteed by you, India's biggest bonafide liar ?
I'm not lying
A dog's tail insists it became ramrod straight half an hour ago ?
You're as old as my father... no one's had the cheek to talk to her like that
So you respect your elders now, do you ?
- And why shouldn't we ?
Now don't tell me you pray first thing every morning too !
She does
So...?
- So what !
Now you pray to your heart's content in jail !
It's all your fault... now suffer.
- My fault ?
Who's idea was it to go straight ?
- lt was for a good cause... do you want your son to go to jail ?
- So where's he going now ?
Now I see how the two of you have been fooling people for years
Pappu is hungry
Pappu ?
When did we start calling him Pappu ?
Got to call him something no?
You're thinking of the gold all the time
Let's step outside for a while I'm not going anywhere.
- Up
Darned luck.
No one ever caught us when we were in the thick of it
But the moment we quit...
- Why did you get into all this ?
I wanted to become someone important.
- And... you became ?
You won't understand.
- Why... why won't I understand ?
Because he never did.
- Who ?
My father
He's just like you
You're trying to con me again
May I...?
- A smoke ?
Sure...
Where are you going ?
If she sees me smoking she'll scream
The child will stay with the mother
What's the use of crying now ?
Should've considered this beforehand.
- What else to do ?
Become a ticket collector and collect ten rupee bribes all my life ?
You can come in
We'll have to make a phone call to your home or mine
We certainly can't take him with us.
- No, it won't come to that I'll figure something.
- And con ourselves out of this one too ?
What else to do ?
Take with me to jail, the very son for whose sake I gave up everything ?
What justice !
Jails are for reforming.
And here, three people are being jailed
Text:
By RahelSurshi :)
Two of whom have reformed and a third who's completely innocent
Don't worry Vimmi. I'll crack a plan.
- What plan Rakesh ?
We've run out of plans
Vimmi do you have any idea what jails are like ?
How will you spend so many years inside one ?
Let's do something, I'll take the blame for everything
Then you're free to go home to Fursatganj with the baby
All you wanted was to become a model I dragged you into this whole thing
You can't even make a cup of tea for yourself. ln jail... how ?
I'll manage Vimmi, don't worry about me
Have you ever managed to do anything alone ?
In any case, Bunty is nothing without Babli
Get up
Unlock yourselves... I can't do it...
We're nearing the railway signal on the outskirts of Delhi
The train halts there for two minutes
The two of...
The three of you can get off and go wherever you wish
No one recognises Bunty and Babli except me
And no one ever will
Sir...
- Shut up.
Not a word
Or I just might change my mind
Get going
That's enough
Whether it was my life's biggest mistake or their best con act, I didn't know
But policemen are human too, believe it or not... we wear those uniforms only on our body, at heart we're as vulnerable as babies
I believed I had destroyed Bunty-Babli, so I let Rakesh and Vimmi go... because I think the law needs to destroy crime, not lives
The bank's gold was recovered from the spot Babli had indicated
The recoveries continued for months afterwards...
Monies and valuables stolen by Bunty and Babli I think they had told me the truth about going back... to live respectable, honest lives like their parents
Rakesh'ji could you perhaps increase the pressure
What a joy
This world we live in has two kinds of Pappus.
One... the kind who obey their parents and get to eat chocolates and the kind that doesn't and gets locked up inside toilets
You are...?
- The first
My darling baby
But he didn't even drink his milk.
- He'll eat the chocolate
What good are chocolates?
You and your fads
No, I'm feeling cold...
- Forget the cold.
Be fashionable
What are you teaching Pappu ?
To speak the truth and pray every morning
Where's my son ?
One of his friends is waiting downstairs
Friends and folks in Fursatganj find all the time for fun
You fix the name of this city.
I'll fix this friend
My son is genius from... childhood
I am very lucky l got a daughter-in-law who is very very smart
It's such a joy to know that our son and his wife... have done things so important that your department still remembers them
Never told folks at home what all you achieved ?
Maybe you should tell us
Nervous already ?
A scam is in the offing
Huge scam
Sir... I swear by my son, I've given it up
I've no idea of what scams are happening
For three years now, I'm following a work-home-work routine
This scam has got to be stopped.
- Then go ahead and stop it
We cannot stop it
Who else can ?
You
Then save me from this respectable-dignified life !
Please
Who's saying this ?
You or...?
- We both I'm through lf l make mango pickle one more time I'll die lt's killing me, Rakesh
Keep the faith
Hace tiempo me dijo que estaba en el negocio de la limpieza
Once upon a time he told me that he was in the business of cleaning

Have you thought from her perspective?
Ever considered how'd she feel living on a boat for ten years?
Don't confine that girl anymore just because of your selfish greed.
I'm gonna find that girl's parents and come back for sure.
Wedding Day
is that old man crazy?
Asshole...
What the hell?
Asshole...
-What the hell...
- Are you crazy?
We paid to come here, so how could you run us out now?
- Hey old man!
- Just leave it alone.
I said let's go!
I said let's go!
Who the hell said to come here?
Her parents are looking for her.
You have to leave here now.
I know it hurts to leave him after he raised you for ten years, but you have to see the world.
What gives a kidnapper the right to hit her?
Ever considered her parents, who've looked for her for ten years?
Because of your vile desires you've destroyed a human being's life!
You're a demon for ruining this girl's life!
Tell me my fortune, too.
I want to know whether I'll leave with this girl, or whether you'll marry her and live happily.
You're scared, aren't you?
I'll leave tomorrow morning.
Please let her go.
She has to see what's out there.
Are you OK?
2005?

Hey kid, come here.
How old are you?
I heard you came on this boat when you were seven and never left.
You really lived just on this boat?
Gosh, then you won't know anything about what goes on outside.
Hey kid.
That old man isn't your grandfather, is he?
You two just sleep?
Why'd you dress so light?
Yeah.
Did you know that old man's gonna marry that girl when she turns 17?
What a rotten thief.
I bet they cuddle up all night.
Don't look.
An arrow will pierce your eye.
Oh yeah, I heard he tells fortunes.
- Fortunes?
- Yeah!
What kind of fortunes?
Old man, tell me my fortune.
My wife's been fishy lately, and nothing's working out for me.
What lunatic reads fortunes that way?
You're right.
What?
Fuck this!
Why?
Is your wife cheating?
Old man, what you said was true?
- I'm asking you if it's true?
- What did he say?
For someone who traps a kid on a boat, what does he know about fortunes?
You were kidding, right?
Think he'd kid around after risking that girl's life to tell your fortune?
So what did he say?
Wedding Day
It's tiny.
Try catching one of these at least.
Go sit over there.
One, two, three.
Take a look.
Hey you, come here.
Come sit here, hurry.
This is you.
You came out better than I thought.
Hey, are you living with that old man?
You're really pretty.
Stay still.
I'll grab it for you.
Hold this.
I'll look for it.
Now hold still.
- Get out of there!
- Where could it be?
I'll grab it for you.
Hey, I'll find it!
Let's see, where could it be?
Could it be here?
Asshole.
Come here.
Will it be okay?
Shit, we're the only ones here.
Old man, don't you think you were too harsh on us?
- She's not there?
- No.
Go in.
She's not here.
See if there's a way out.
How old are you?
Have you been to Seoul?
You'd probably be in high school.
You just lived on this boat?
Aren't you lonely?
Is that old man your grandfather?
Dad.
Is that girl his granddaughter?
No, he found her when she was six.
Gosh, it's been ten years already.
Then she lived on this boat for ten years?
And she never left?
I think so.
How could he do that to her?
He's a bad person.
Old man!
My business isn't doing so well lately.
Could you tell me my fortune?
Isn't this too dangerous?
What if she gets hit?
He wasn't a mute?
What did he say?
Why are you laughing?
What did he say?
What are you doing?
I didn't touch her!
What's with you, old man?
Have you thought from her perspective?
Ever considered how'd she feel living on a boat for ten years?
Don't confine that girl anymore just because of your selfish greed.
I'm gonna find that girl's parents and come back for sure.

Did you know that old man's gonna marry that girl when she turns 17?
What a rotten thief.
I bet they cuddle up all night.
Don't look.
An arrow will pierce your eye.
Oh yeah, I heard he tells fortunes.
- Fortunes?
- Yeah!
What kind of fortunes?
Old man, tell me my fortune.
My wife's been fishy lately, and nothing's working out for me.
What lunatic reads fortunes that way?
You're right.
What?
Fuck this!
Why?
Is your wife cheating?
Old man, what you said was true?
- I'm asking you if it's true?
- What did he say?
For someone who traps a kid on a boat, what does he know about fortunes?
You were kidding, right?
Think he'd kid around after risking that girl's life to tell your fortune?
So what did he say?
Wedding Day
It's tiny.
Try catching one of these at least.
Go sit over there.
One, two, three.
Take a look.
Hey you, come here.
Come sit here, hurry.
This is you.
You came out better than I thought.
Hey, are you living with that old man?
You're really pretty.
Stay still.
I'll grab it for you.
Hold this.
I'll look for it.
Now hold still.
- Get out of there!
- Where could it be?
I'll grab it for you.
Hey, I'll find it!
Let's see, where could it be?
Could it be here?
Asshole.
Come here.
Will it be okay?
Shit, we're the only ones here.
Old man, don't you think you were too harsh on us?
- She's not there?
- No.
Go in.
She's not here.
See if there's a way out.
How old are you?
Have you been to Seoul?
You'd probably be in high school.
You just lived on this boat?
Aren't you lonely?
Is that old man your grandfather?
Dad.
Is that girl his granddaughter?
No, he found her when she was six.
Gosh, it's been ten years already.
Then she lived on this boat for ten years?
And she never left?
I think so.
How could he do that to her?
He's a bad person.
Old man!
My business isn't doing so well lately.
Could you tell me my fortune?
Isn't this too dangerous?
What if she gets hit?
He wasn't a mute?
What did he say?
Why are you laughing?
What did he say?
What are you doing?
I didn't touch her!
What's with you, old man?
Have you thought from her perspective?
Ever considered how'd she feel living on a boat for ten years?
Don't confine that girl anymore just because of your selfish greed.
I'm gonna find that girl's parents and come back for sure.
Wedding Day
Is that old man crazy?
Asshole...
What the hell?
Asshole...
- What the hell...
- Are you crazy?
We paid to come here, so how could you run us out now?
- Hey old man!
- Just leave it alone.
I said let's go!
I said let's go!
Who the hell said to come here?
Her parents are looking for her.
You have to leave here now.
I know it hurts to leave him after he raised you for ten years, but you have to see the world.
What gives a kidnapper the right to hit her?
Ever considered her parents, who've looked for her for ten years?
Because of your vile desires you've destroyed a human being's life!
You're a demon for ruining this girl's life!
Tell me my fortune, too.
I want to know whether I'll leave with this girl, or whether you'll marry her and live happily.
You're scared, aren't you?
I'll leave tomorrow morning.
Please let her go.
She has to see what's out there.
Are you OK?
(waves)
Sebastian came to me.
I was coaching the 11-year-olds and under.
He came to me when he was six and said he could play.
I said, "No, you're not ready yet."
He said, "Dan, I promise I can play."
So I gave him a shot.
I didn't play him.
I put him on the team, but I never played him.
My best player fouled out.
I put him in, and he was making moves that...
I couldn't describe them, because he was six years old, and I was like, "Oh, my God."
And we lost the game, but we went upstairs and I told my mother, "He can play."
I said, "A little work, a little help here, a little help there, he can play."
And then he told me.
After everybody went to bed, we sat up, he told me, "Dan, I really want to play this game.
I want to be good."

(# "Moment of Clarity" by Jay-Z)
# Thank God for granting' me this moment of clarity
# This moment of honesty The world'll feel my truths
# Through my hard-knock life.
My gift and the curse
# I gave you volume after volume of my work so you can feel my truths
# I built the dynasty by being one of the realest niggers out
# Way beyond a reasonable doubt
# From my "Blueprint" beginnings to that "Black Album" endin'
# Listen close.
You hear what I'm about Nigger feel my truths
I mean, the kid been making noise for years, and they're talking about him like he's a superstar already, which, in a sense, he is.
In the 'hood, he's a superstar to them.
He has a cult following.
It's like people are obsessed with seeing what he do, because they've never seen it.
I've been here 37 years.
I've never seen a game like that in Coney Island.
He has a smile, he's marketable, he's intelligent.
He has everything.
He has everything that a superstar needs.
# Thank God for granting' me this moment of clarity
# This moment of honesty The world'll feel my truths
# Through my hard-knock life.
My gift and the curse
# I gave you volume after volume of my work so you can feel my truths
Ain't nobody ending.
Ain't nobody leaving from the court.
All day, 24-7.
I can't sleep sometimes.
From my window I can hear the ball bouncing all night.
All night.
All night.
Right.
This is MSG.
We call it the Garden.
So this is where all the talent comes and plays.
Everybody comes and competes.
This has been going on a long time.
It's the Garden.
Everybody knows about the Garden in New York.
Back up, back up, man.
Hi.
- How you doing?
- (woman) Hi.
How are you?
If there was a place where I had to put my child, and I wanted him to be a basketball player,
I'd put him right in Coney Island, anywhere in Coney Island, from Stillwell to Seagate.
Every block, there's a basketball court.
When you step out of the building you see the court, and that's what your friends do, so you've got no choice but to play basketball.
And then having Stephon make it out of the projects.
All the kids, we all saw that.
He pulled up with his Bentley, and we know his mother has a big house, and that's something that we all wanted.
Third floor.
That's my window right there.
Third floor.
Stephon - fourth floor, you know?
That's where all the talent comes from around here.
Sebastian's a mixture of a lot of players from Coney Island.
He has the talent like Stephon, he got a jump shot like me, he got a handle like the kid named Strawberry that lives on 20-07, used to be here.
He's a mixture.
Give me five.
Here.
Here.
- I got money.
- Give me a dollar.
Give me a dollar.
You don't want the ball?
He ain't from Coney Island.
What you doing to them in the house?
You gotta sleep with the ball.
When you're growing up, put it under your arm, go to sleep on it.
And your dream will come true.
(Sebastian) Look.
Rest in peace, Deuce.
This is his wall here.
Got killed on the streets.
Gunned down.
He was on his way to Georgia Tech.
He lived right in this building right here.
So we definitely keep his name alive, and every time we walk by, we say, "What's up?" to him.
Like, "What's up, Deuce?"
(man) Everybody starts, but nobody finishes when it comes to basketball.
One year half the team failed off.
They all decided that they wasn't gonna go back to school, they wasn't gonna finish, and they're still here not finishing.
That's why when we get one, the whole 'hood embraces him.
(Sebastian) Give me five, huh?
Whoo!
Give me five, huh?
This is my little brother Ethan right here.
Ethan, King Osiris, the mighty king.
He's next.
They're coming for you, little bro.
He'll go for a hundred million out of eighth grade.
Whoo!
Whoo!
It's a cycle.
He'll be just like me.
I was just like him.
In one.
This is what we wanna do for the rest of our lives - play basketball.
- I'm tired.
- You tired?
(laughter)
So you beat me.
- You beat me, son?
- You gotta win.
You gotta.
You're the man.
You're the king of the clay.
(woman) OK.
This is my mother.
For all the reporters that call and want to speak to my mother and see her, here she is, right here, all right?
I'm making some lunch for the boys.
My mother's the best cook in the world.
If you don't know that, you better ask somebody.
For real.
My mother's a warrior.
There was times...
When we say when we were coming up that we was poor, it was not, like, poor that we lived in the projects and...
We was poor, man.
We didn't have nothing.
We didn't have anything, really, so...
There was times...
I remember, and I always said - I never said this on camera - there was times when I had no sneakers.
I would have a pair of boots, and I had no sneakers.
So I had to borrow a pair of sneakers from my friends, or take my sister's - we used to wear the same size sneakers - or take her sneakers and go to my games.
That was...
I remember those things.
I don't forget.
A lot of people would have made a bigger thing about everything I was doing.
My mother helped keep me levelheaded.
She'll be happy about it, she'll smile about it, but she was like, you know:
"It's really nothing until you make it."
She's seen what happened with my brother.
My brother had one foot inside the door, then they snatched his dream from him.
- This is my big brother.
- I don't play that.
See?
I said I'd show you my big brother.
My brother...
Being in a poor family, my brother had a chance to go to the NBA, so she was excited about that.
Then when it didn't happen, that shattered a lot of dreams within my household.
(Daniel) My brother Jamel went to Providence.
He went four years.
He led the Big East at scoring, and he didn't get drafted.
That was never heard of.
I'd never even heard of that before.
(Sebastian) I remember that day.
We was in the house watching the draft.
We was reading in the magazines he's gonna be between ten and 15, so we just knew he was gonna get drafted.
We all sat here and we waited for his name to be called, and it never got called.
You look at the second round, you'd think there's not a lot of good players, but Jamel Thomas from Providence, I like his game.
I think these guys are steals if they fall down any further.
I was just thinking that everybody was gonna be all right, everybody was gonna be all right.
Unfortunately, everybody just got hurt from it.
I didn't even get picked up at all.
The whole house was crying and it's like, "What am I supposed to do?"
That experience was probably the worst day of my life.
To be honest, when Steph made it, I thought I made it too.
I felt like I made it.
It was like, "OK, you made it, everybody else is gonna make it."
And then when he bought his mother the house, I had the same ideas.
Thought it was gonna be like that, but it just didn't happen.
But I'd tell Sebastian, I'd say, "That's why you must work hard every day."
"Put yourself in my shoes and don't put yourself in Stephon's shoes."
"You don't want to happen to you what happened to me."
You know, it hurt my mother so, and she was so devastated, she just couldn't take it.
She wouldn't be able to take it if that was to happen to Sebastian.
So that's why she's really shy with the cameras and stuff like that - she really ain't into it, you know.
(interviewer) How does that fit into your motivation?
That's big, right there.
That's big.
I'm working for my mother, to change that day around, that draft day, for her, which wasn't good.
You know, for me to come and put a smile on my mother's face.
And we're gonna do it too.
We've gotta go up the steps.
Good afternoon, and thank you all for being here.
We're all here for one main reason, and I would like to introduce him now.
Please welcome Sebastian Telfair.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I want to thank everyone for coming here today and showing support for me.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
To also, my family, I want to thank you all for sticking with me.
I know it ain't easy.
I watch you go through everything I go through.
I love you all.
Everything is gonna be good.
Now I'll tell you what I came to tell everybody, that I will be attending the University of Louisville, with Rick Pitino.
I'll take any questions.
Right there.
(man) Physically, how will you handle the rigors of college basketball?
It's very physical, the conference that you're gonna be in.
- Are you prepared?
- Am I prepared?
Yes, I'm prepared.
I'm from Coney Island.
(laughter)
(applause)
Now, pick it up.
Good.
Good.
Better.
(man) Put the hands up!
Good.
Give me the ball.
Everything is good.
Get out the way.
I'm looking for attitude.
This is all good.
This is all good.
This is all good.
This is all good.
This is all good.
Yeah, Jerry!
Good job, you.
Good job, you!
That nigger nuked on a rebound!
(man) This season's a big season.
Last year we repeated as city champions.
If we win again.
It'd be three in a row.
Which would be the first ever in PSAL history.
New York City's the Mecca of basketball.
If you can win three championships in a league where Hall-of-Fame players came from, that's unbelievable.
Ah!
Game!
Y'all running no better than that?
Damn!
Stop!
This season it's real!
- (girl) Good luck.
- Thanks.
- Come on, buddy.
- Have a good one.
Good luck, baby.
Good luck.
We need a shot of you, kind of like you're walking to the game, holding a basketball.
See where those people just walked out there?
If you walk out, but then walk my way.
(commentator) Rose Hill gym at Fordham University.
The main stage for tonight's Edgewater-Lincoln game.
The task in hand.
Slowing down this man -
Sebastian Telfair from Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.
Is he the greatest or simply the latest?
One question that begs in the progressive high school basketball classic.
(Daniel) We're the team everybody came to see.
All right?
These motherfucking lights is on now.
These motherfucking lights is on now!
(all shout)
- (Daniel) Aight!
- (all) Aight!
- (Daniel) Aight!
- (all) Aight!
Let's do it, then.
(commentator) Darius Washington heats it up.
Nice pitch to Brandon Johnson.
Antonio Pena with a slam.
Ripping it again.
Feeling it.
Spin cycle.
Telfair.
Coming right back with a little dunk.
You gotta love this.
(whistle)
(man) Hey, listen.
Is it your back?
Your knee?
Maybe it's his ankle.
Suck it up, man.
- (woman) Is it his leg?
- (woman #2) His ankle.
(man) Come on, let's go.
Help him up.
Let's go.
Come on.
(applause)
The war's not over yet, nigger.
We're down, but we ain't out.
The war's not over yet.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Argh!
Hold on.
Hold on.
Ah!
See?
No, no.
(man) You ain't got it up here, right?
You all right?
These niggers are busting your ass so let's get to work.
Let's stop all the bullshitting.
'Cause pain is temporary.
Just go a little.
You're gonna have to walk it out.
Focus, baby.
You'll be smiling after this.
I'll be waiting to see you at the door.
(all) One, two, three, together!
- Where we at?
- I'm right here.
- Where we at?
- We're on the floor right now.
We're on the floor right now.
It's time to shine, nigger.
It's time to shine, nigger.
It's time to shine.
(commentator) Telfair looking spry on a bad wheel.
Telfair got the switch.
Nice beat inside.
That's how you drop a dime.
Here comes Darius Washington.
And picked clean by Telfair.
Telfair with the left.
I'm liking some of that.
The lead is down to two.
And Sebastian Telfair has a menacing look in his eyes.
Telfair with 24. and the meter is still running.
And gets the charge.
Listen, motherfuckers, when he runs through the screen, hit the fucking nigger, you hear me?
Come on.
What the fuck?
(commentator) Telfair reeling.
Got it back on the give-and-go.
Hit the floor.
That's a New York City shot.
And Lincoln has a one-point lead.
Telfair kicks it out.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
Congratulations.
That was a great game.
What a game.
- You do a super job.
- (man) You do a great job.
Thank you for everything.
Watching him, I realize that if he puts on a Louisville uniform, he'll be the best point guard that I would have coached at the collegiate ranks.
And you have Derek Jeter, Yankee superstar come in.
Then you have Jay-Z.
Then you have two or three professional scouts, which makes me uneasy.
Jeter was great, Jay-Z was outstanding, but the pro scouts made me a little uneasy.
So I left in a little bit of turmoil, because that was probably the first time since recruiting Sebastian that I felt there was a chance he could entertain the NBA.
Telfair, can I have your signature, please?
Thanks, Telfair.
(Jamel) This year's important for Sebastian.
To be honest.
I think that's a good decision to go to Louisville.
But I think as the season goes on, I think scouts and gyms will bite.
They'll take him out.
I think he's that good.
But I'm on my way to Greece to play professional basketball, and the reason why I have to go, because I provide the money for my family.
If you can't make it in the NBA and you want to make money.
You have to take your talent across the water.
(man) He did.
Don't deny it.
(man #2) Nah, I can't.
Who are you going with?
Who are you going with?
I'm the commentator.
Who are you going with tonight?
- Carmelo.
- Carmelo.
OK.
We got one for Carmelo.
Mr. Sebastian Telfair, who are you going with?
- King James.
- King James.
Oh, dunk that, Bronny.
Let's go.
We gotta get some more of those.
We gotta get some more of those.
King James.
That's all you needed, the dunk.
That's it.
It's over.
It's just a game when you're playing, but this is a business.
Definitely at the time that I'm coming up, it's a lot different.
These guys like LeBron James, $90 million for the sneaker contract, this ain't no game.
$90 million - 100, whatever he got - for a sneaker?
That's not no game.
This is serious.
At a certain age, a certain stage in your life, if you're one of those people, it turns completely into a business.
When I was in junior high school I wanted a tattoo.
I wanted a tattoo or something.
My brothers shout me down:
"You can't get no tattoos.
It's not gonna be good for your image."
So that's my business.
I'm starting my business right there.
That's like a job.
Like, people get up and go to work,
I get up and go to school and play basketball.
Your first business you're gonna get, if you're one of the top basketball players, is the sneaker market, where they got a basketball camp, like Adidas, Reebok and Nike.
The sneaker companies come and recruit you and try to get you to go to their camp.
You're with them through your high-school years, and so when you go on to college or the NBA, you're friends with them and that's what sneaker you'll sign with.
The first thing we in the industry do is identify the kid.
Then you get the kid and he's on your camp list, he plays in your all-star games.
He'll get every new product that the company has.
I guarantee it.
He's no different than Jay-Z going into a playground.
He walks in, all the people know who he is and you want him showing your logo.
But you gotta have the high-school team, because you have access to the paraphernalia of the high-school kid - all the uniforms that they wear, the gym that they play in, signage everywhere.
It's a smart promotion.
That's a gift from Adidas.
Brandon, come over and help me with this.
Find me some 12s.
I think today's kid - the star kid, the one that you've anointed through the media and through your own intuition - when he's given the goodies, he is gonna be the man.
Whoo!
He knows it and the world knows it, and the teammates know it also.
6-2.
- (man) What's on the line, Tiny?
- The sneakers.
They're playing for the sneakers right now, man.
Anything goes.
Ooh.
Those sneakers.
Watch those shoes, man.
Here are the sneakers.
Here are the sneakers.
Big game.
We're going to Sheepshead Bay.
You know, they always give us a hard time.
The atmosphere over there is crazy.
All the other sports, they get a bus to go to the games.
The basketball team, we don't.
And we're, like, the best team in the school.
We don't get no love.
All these championships, we should get a bus.
- It's cold out here, man.
- It's freezing.
(Nyan) I don't like coming through here, man.
Especially at night, man.
I don't like this stuff.
We gotta do this every other game, man.
We'll be smacking teams, 'cause we'll be pissed off.
By the time we get there we'll be mad already.
I think we got off at the wrong stop, man.
(cheering)
He's gonna stop!
No foul!
No foul!
He's gonna stop.
(Sebastian) Yo, where are the uniforms at?
Where are the uniforms at?
He wants to play, wants to help his team.
So...
I always tell him, if it ain't broken, you can play, so...
Sebastian, please be careful.
(crowd chanting)
(buzzer)
I'm not mad because we lost.
I'm mad at everybody because...
Y'all motherfuckers don't sacrifice for nothing.
All y'all care about is y'all.
If y'all don't go out and fight for each other, and dive on the floor, and scratch and bite, whatever you gotta do to win, together, we ain't gonna win.
We ain't gonna win.
Not fucking hanging around.
You're tragic.
You should be the motherfucker busting your ass.
Ain't nobody gonna fucking fail me with the college.
Nobody!
You should be the first nigger trying to do it.
I didn't go to college.
All my brothers went to college, but I put my foot in the ass.
All of them.
Wake up, man.
Better wake up.
You're only as good as right now.
Once it's over, it's over.
Once it's over, it's over, yo.
(Dan) These awards are my pride and joy.
This - "We present this award to our assistant coach of the year Daniel Turner.
"From all your players."
This is all voluntary, what I do.
Everything I do is from my heart.
The big thing - my brother's there, so...
I told my mother I'd take care of him, so...
That's pretty much why I do that.
I'm one of Sebastian's biggest fans, so I put this together.
You know?
This is his first year at ABCD camp.
He turned it out.
His first year at ABCD camp, he was with Stephon.
This one right here, he's 13.
That's when he first really became noticed.
I don't know if you can get this, but this is Stephon and Sebastian.
Sebastian was seven.
Stephon was still at high school.
That's throwback for you right there.
I think I sacrificed a lot for my brothers.
And not just Sebastian, for all my brothers.
That was my job, being the oldest, you know, to make sure they fulfilled their life.
You know, I live through them.
At the end of the day, I'm happy 'cause they're happy.
That's all that matters.
(Tiny) Ten.
Doubling it - 20.
At least you got two vowels.
Is it your turn, Coach?
I'll be taking the lead.
What are you gonna spell with that crap?
Not with this, you gotta...
- I know.
I played Scrabble.
- All right, then.
University of Louisville.
Hey, what's up?
- What up?
- What's up with you?
Sebastian, how are you, man?
How you been?
In the zone, buddy.
In the zone.
This shit's crazy.
We need some equipment at Lincoln, man.
If I get a chance, I'm gonna get Lincoln some equipment like this.
This is nice.
This is the dorm at Louisville.
We're trying to see what's up in there.
Know what I mean?
(Sebastian) This is for the players.
I'm gonna show you this room.
Damn, I ought to pass my classes.
- Oh, this is hot!
- (Sebastian) Oh, this is crazy.
Yo, this whole wall...
this whole wall right here's a TV.
Look.
This comes down.
See that thing there?
- Are you serious?
- This is crazy.
- Mom.
What's up?
It's Sebastian.
- (news report on television)
I'm fine.
Yeah, everything's good.
Yeah, they're treating us real nice.
There's a lot of fans out here, so it's real nice.
We didn't play.
We play tomorrow at 5 o'clock.
Cardinal fans will get a glimpse of the future tomorrow after the U of L game.
Brooklyn point guard sensation.
Sebastian Telfair.
And PRP big man.
Terrance Farley.
Will share the floor at Louisville Gardens.
The two future teammates talked about Saturday's game in a news conference.
Telfair trying to put the talk about him heading straight for the NBA behind him.
- I will be at Louisville.
- (man) Is that a definite?
Is that a definite?
Yeah.
If I'm alive.
(newscaster) Tipoff for tomorrow's game is 5pm.
What's up?
Look at this.
So cute.
"Bassy buzz."
I like that.
"The Bassy buzz."
(cheering)
I named my cat Bassy, because he's our favorite player now.
It's packed out there.
Louisville is not playing around.
They take it serious.
So going here, it's about...
I went around and saw seven teams' NBA scouts there.
- (man #1) Man!
- (man #2) What?
I've seen B.J. Armstrong, I've seen Danny Ainge.
- That got me nervous!
- I don't know who B.J. Armstrong is.
He's, like, a scout for the Chicago Bulls.
This is a big game, son.
(cheering)
- What's up, Bassy?
- What's up, man?
(commentator) Number 31.
Sebastian Telfair.
(commentator) Sebastian Telfair.
And that's the ball game.
Final score:
Lincoln. 77.
Beavers. 69.
(man) OK.
Thank you.
Say thank you.
Thanks.
Only doing T-shirts.
If you don't have a T-shirt, please get out of line.
- "Chosen one."
- That's for you.
- That's not to sign.
- That's for you.
(Sebastian) Thank you.
And can you sign this?
Get them Cardinals to the nationals.
After the game, I got a call from Sonny Vacarro and I'm speaking to him, 'cause he's somebody that always helped me out all through my years at high school, and I get a lot of information from him.
So I'm thinking, "I just had a good game."
I'm not thinking, "OK, NBA guys is looking at me now."
He spoke to me.
He was like, "Things is turning."
I was like, "What do you mean?"
He was like, "I think you got a shot of going to the NBA."
So I laughed.
I called my mother.
She was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah.
Don't listen to that."
We was all together.
We heard something like shots.
We didn't know what it was.
My mother was nervous and Ethan was hysterical.
There's ten of us in my family.
It could've been any one of us.
And my little brother Ethan plays in this hallway, running up and down.
This hallway's haunting me.
It could have been anybody.
Let's hope God takes better care of them than we did.
You know, there's tragedy everywhere.
This past weekend it hit so close to home.
That's something you want your family away from, and that's what I'm trying to do.
Where they don't gotta witness things like people getting murdered, things like that.
I was sitting and thinking and I asked myself, you know, what I feel is best for me and my family.
You know, you hear everyone and, you know, what they got to say, people, you know, filling your head with...
You gotta be true to yourself.
'Cause if someone believes in me and I don't, then that doesn't mean anything.
You know, me, personally, I do think I can play in the NBA.
But I'm still in the projects.
My mother's still gotta struggle in the projects.
I'm still broke.
You know.
So I'm still grounded.
Just trying to.
You know...
Just waiting for my chance.
(man) A lot of people out here dying for stupid reasons.
I've seen a lot of people die out here, close friends' demise.
You know, I used to be a knucklehead when I was growing up, so if you get a chance to live, do it.
There's a lot of people that wish they could sit here and tell a story like I'm telling it.
But they're not.
Out here, basketball saves a lot of us.
A lot of young people will say it gives you something to do.
Everybody wants to be a baller.
Everybody growing up out here wants to be an NBA player.
(interviewer) What would life here be like without basketball?
There won't be no life.
It would be nothing.
There would be nothing out here.
I'm calling my man Tick Tick Boom over 'cause he was striving to go to NBA too.
He's still out here, you know, trying to do his thing.
My man, what's up?
It was fun at school, but after you get out and you realize you're not as good as you wanna be or you thought you was, it becomes a burden because you're trying to be the best you could be,
and your best is not what people want.
When it hit me, it was like, "I'm not gonna get paid for this."
It felt like I'd lost my life.
Basketball was my life.
As you get older, you know it's just a game.
When you're young, you're thinking this game's gonna get your mother this house, get your family out of here.
Once you see...
That was the biggest burden.
That's why it's hard to explain, 'cause once I didn't, I knew my mother'd still be here, my sister'd still be down there, my brother'd be over there.
So that was, like, the hardest thing.
I just wasn't doing this for myself.
Then once you fail, you really feel like you failed your family.
I'm still here.
It's pain.
As long as I'm here, it's pain.
No lie.
As long as I'm here, it's pain.
- Do what you gotta do.
- (cheering)
(# "Radio Free Brooklyn" by Pete Miser)
(man) Oh, yeah!
Yes, baby!
(commentator) Telfair spins right through the defense.
Two defenders came up there to help.
It didn't matter.
Stay down, Nyan!
(commentator) Inside there.
Howard extends and flushes.
- Ooh!
- (whistle)
(commentator) Howard spinning right.
Telfair knifing through the defense.
And he finishes.
Hey, take your time, boy.
It's like walking in the park, boy.
(commentator) Now the final 11 seconds.
Telfair controlling.
Here we go.
They get it to Telfair.
Telfair.
The step-back three-pointer.
- He knocks it down!
- (cheering)
Where's my mother?
Where's my mother?
Where's Mommy?
You did it again.
(Sebastian) Yeah!
- We don't gotta count this strip too long.
- I know.
That was one shot I'll never forget.
That was my first buzzer beater I ever hit.
When you know the NBA's there and everyone's around, they're looking at you, they wanna see if you're that player that they're reading about, like my brother Dan says, when the lights is on, it's time to perform.
My nigger!
I wasn't expecting to come out and play well and get the attention that I'm getting.
Not how it's going now.
I think it's a lot better than I thought it would ever go, but, you know, it's here and it's happening.
He raised a big stink about it, and then he said, "I guess it's taken care of."
'Cause someone showed him the check and now it's kinda fine.
It was always fine.
He just was attacking me because he wanted direct communication with players and I wouldn't give it to him.
I don't know why people have got hard feelings.
I don't know why people don't think I've been around.
My record speaks for itself.
(Tiny) It's no worse than anybody writing a story about you that got the facts mixed up.
I don't see no problem.
I'm only doing what I was taught - what was done to me.
When I was coming to high school, people used to try to recruit people, or give us free sneakers here and there.
People just blow it up because I'm winning and I'm young, and I'm not the prototype high-school coach anymore.
I look like...
I dress like, you know, the kids, because that's my environment.
And if I was put in Wall Street, I'd look like somebody in Wall Street.
I'm from Coney Island, so I'm looking like I'm from Coney Island.
There's a lot of people out there that have got so much negativity to say.
"Oh, he's driving an Escalade."
"Oh, his brother wears a diamond watch."
"Dan got a Rolex."
So what?
I mean, we all work and we want nice things too.
When you're dealing with project kids, we're being fathers, we're big brothers, sometimes we're even being mothers.
We feed most of these kids every day.
You know, and it's sad that I had to read that article about Coach.
That hurt me, because I'm with him all the time, so I know he don't do the things they say he's doing.
You know?
I know since my brother's been here, he's protecting my brother like it was his brother.
So, you know, it's a real situation that people just don't understand.
Do y'all understand?
In the history of the Public Schools League, no team has ever won three straight championships.
Motherfuckers want y'all like...
Y'all are targets.
"One...
"and we done!"
That's some scary shit, son.
Five games to win the championship.
Don't get nervous on me, son.
He's shaking with nerves.
All the other games we played, that don't mean shit.
That buzzer beater that he shot?
It's over.
Done.
# Get up, I get down Get up, I get down
# Get up, I get down Get up, I get down
# All right
# It's all right It's all right
# She's got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
# She's got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
# I'm gonna play this Gladys Knight
# Me and you gonna get right to Baby Remington
# And we can set this party off right
Let's go, y'all.
Let's go, y'all.
OK, y'all, it's playoff time here.
It's playoff time.
We don't get to stand here.
Let's go and tear this motherfucking gym up.
(applause)
OK, you're scared, nigger.
You're scared.
Get that shit outta here.
Get the fuck outta here.
Run!
Run!
Run!
Tony!
Tony!
- (man) No play.
- (whistle)
What the fuck?
Where's the ball?
Shaking his fucking head, man.
Fuck y'all niggers, man.
- I'm driving the ball.
I'm driving it.
- Go right up to the post!
I don't want you to play, I want you to score!
Play later.
(Tiny) We can't play with them at all, man.
There shouldn't be tricks until all-star games or citywides.
- That's how I play.
- If you complete the plays, it's all good.
I do complete the plays.
He called.
- You don't understand.
- I shoot, you make a face.
It's a team thing.
It's not about me.
But you don't understand.
You really don't understand.
I could have kept Nyan and Eugene in the game.
They got two fouls.
They could've got three.
So when I put the subs in the game, you gotta be very aggressive to score.
'Cause it could be Boetsa, Cardozo.
They got two fouls, first half.
Now I got subs in the game, and you gotta be very aggressive to score.
- Let's go warm up.
- Let's go, y'all.
You should be on 30 right now.
(Tiny) Do you know who that is?
L.A. Clippers.
One move, you could fuck everything up.
One bullshit playing around, it gets twisted, you know what I mean?
Don't understand.
Fuck.
Always say something.
(whistle)
- I'm going.
- (Tiny) Squeeze the ball.
(whistle)
(whistle)
Get the fuck outta here.
Fuck these niggers, man.
Hey, Sebastian, look right here.
OK, just put one finger up.
(cameras click)
All right, this ain't no photo shoot, man.
Hey, you got a wristband, man?
My brother's a fan of yours, man.
Thank you.
That's one step.
Let's go to the next step.
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.
Don't mind me.
That's all I got to say.
I'll see you all tomorrow.
There's a guy, Mike, a photographer.
He's a genius.
This is, like, our third or fourth time working with him already.
- Cold and crazy.
- Cold and crazy.
- Good to see you.
- How are you doing?
Oh, shit!
Oh!
I thought I was gonna be in the sand.
We're going on the trampoline?
You want me to do flips?
- Yes, I want you up there.
- All right.
I know you do.
We're all on there, man.
We're all on there.
Here we go.
Keep going, man.
Keep going.
Just be creative.
Just bounce it, man.
Oh, shit.
If I cut your head off, I'll be crazy.
I love that.
Keep doing that.
This is insane.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Again.
I'm loving it.
Cross your legs and then let go.
You know, something like that.
Just let go.
Give me a smile.
(Dan) Oh!
Number one.
Yeah, but I want him to sign them.
He didn't see them yet.
He doesn't know.
- Yo, that's crazy.
- Yes.
Oh!
That's mine right there.
Say, "Thanks, Coach." For everything I did.
- "Thanks." This is mine right here.
- Yeah.
OK, but wait.
- How'd you get this?
- Don't worry.
Thank you so much.
My mother will be so excited.
It's the picture.
You got Coney Island in the background.
You got the smile, so I was very happy.
You're always making sure I smile.
They want to know if there was any more posters for the team.
- (woman) Posters?
- Yeah, for his closest friends, like me.
No, but I'll order more if you guys want.
Do you guys want these posters?
- Yes.
- I'll order more.
I'll get more.
All right.
- (interviewer) Show us that magazine.
- I'm gonna show it, because I'm proud.
I'm very proud of this.
People say, "Why's he smiling like that?" Because that's him.
That's why.
- He smiles all the time.
Look.
- (interviewer) A million-dollar smile.
My brother prepared my image so the Sebastian y'all see, that's 90% him.
(interviewer) How would you describe that image?
Tiger Woods.
Tiger Tiger Woods, y'all.
Just clean.
Clean, happy, smiling all the time, nice teeth, you know.
That's what it's all about, being happy.
Even when we didn't have nothing, we were still happy, for some reason.
We just had each other.
You know.
And I think we're about to have a lot, right?
- A lot of what?
- A lot of just...
Just a lot more.
You think so?
Yeah, I think we're about to have a lot more.
(cheering)
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
Let's go.
Lincoln, Lincoln!
Lincoln!
(commentator) Sebastian Telfair.
Bassy, step up.
Bassy, step up.
Go, motherfuckers!
Let's go!
Bassy!
What's up, son?
What's up?
If you're tired, put your hand up.
I will sub you.
Don't fucking be out there if you're tired.
I'm a good coach.
I can sub and still play.
If you get ripped at half court, you're tired.
You gotta pick it up, son.
You gotta pick it up.
If you're trying to go to the league, you gotta pick it up.
That's all I got to say.
(whistle)
(commentator) That's a foul.
Number 31.
Sebastian Telfair.
His fourth.
The team's sixth.
(commentator announces scorer)
Yo, I'm ready, man.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
(whistle)
(man) Go, Lincoln!
(commentator) Eugene Lawrence.
Don't let these motherfuckers take this.
Don't let them.
I'm gonna take it, I'm gonna take it from them.
As always.
(commentator) Jamel Jackson.
(commentator) Sebastian Telfair.
Jamel Jackson.
(crowd cheers)
(commentator) Dwayne Morton is on the way to Madison Square Garden.
Congratulations.
- Son, you did your best, man.
- Hold your heads up, guys.
Yo, hold your heads up.
You got nice shit.
You got nice shit, all right?
All right, man.
Hold your head up, man.
It'll be all right.
You'll be all right, boy.
See y'all, man.
Whoo!
Tony, Tony, give me a hug.
I want my fucking hug, you big motherfucker.
(Pitino) If his adviser doesn't say.
"You're going in the top 12."
If he doesn't feel like he's high and that a potential shoe company would have a lot of interest in him, he's coming to Louisville.
So in that regard...
Now, if you ask me my opinion, my opinion is we better get busy recruiting.
My coach, Rick Pitino, down in Louisville, someone interviewed him for a paper.
When they asked him about me and the NBA, he told them what he felt.
You know, he felt that I'm a top-ten pick, you know, and I'm maybe gonna play in the NBA, so that's what he told the papers.
I'm in a barbershop, getting my hair cut.
I need those cuff links.
I gotta leave in the next 20 minutes.
I got something to do with ESPN today.
It don't get no sharper than that.
Yo, are you ready?
I ain't made no decision yet.
Uh, you know, I think, you know, the NBA, you know...
Me in the NBA, I'm fifty-fifty here.
When they come up and see me, I think I'm performing the way they want me to.
But I think Louisville still might be a good place for me.
So we're gonna see.
But right now it's looking real good for the NBA, though.
What up?
There's two pairs in there.
- Yo, get in the back of the car.
- Don't disrespect me.
I'll kick this little...
Some cuff links for my button-up shirts.
There's not gonna be any questions about college or NBA or nothing like that?
I don't know who's doing...
I don't know who's doing the actual questions.
Let's go to New York.
Sebastian Telfair.
All-American at Lincoln.
Joins us now - latest in the line of great New York City point guards.
Sebastian.
How are you?
- I'm fine.
How are you doing?
- You've committed to Louisville.
Have you made your decision whether you will go to Louisville?
Or are you still making your decision on being in the NBA draft?
I think I made a decision when I signed the letter I sent to Louisville.
That's something I'm really excited about - me and Rick Pitino.
This is a process we're going through now.
And I'm having a lot of fun doing it.
Sebastian.
The word is that you're out.
That you're going to the NBA.
Are you saying now that you will be at Louisville?
Well, you know, if the team is definitely, you know...
If a team's saying they want me and I feel comfortable with it, and it's the best thing for me and my family, maybe that would be the decision.
It's something me and Rick Pitino and my family will work out.
Sebastian Telfair.
Joining us from New York.
Best of luck wherever you go.
- Take care.
- Thank you.
Sebastian Telfair joining us.
Now to DeMarcus Nelson...
They didn't ask me about the game, all NBA.
- All NBA?
- "Well, Rick Pitino quoted..."
"Rick Pitino quoted..."
Yo, every fucking day, man.
What the fuck, man?
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Six foot and a half inch.
- You're the exact size as Isiah was.
- I'd say I'm six-one.
Exactly the same as Isiah when he was in high school.
- That's your target.
Isiah's your target.
- Isiah?
Down the road, you know.
That's who you wanna be like.
Yeah, I watched a couple of his tapes.
He was good.
The best six-one and under that ever lived.
- Thanks.
- You got a great handshake.
- Nice firm handshake.
- Oh, yeah.
Good smile.
- Don't lose that, now.
- I won't.
- OK.
If you need me, I'm around.
- I know.
I think Sebastian's going through a whirlwind, so many things happening at one time.
You know, I think that some of the things are getting to him, he just ain't saying it.
My brother's about to do something a lot of people don't get a chance to do.
Sebastian's a special kid.
He's a special kid.
And when we win, 'cause I'm hoping we win and I'm praying we win,
I want him to stand in the middle of Madison Square Garden and say, "I did it."
In front of everybody, "I did it."
(Tiny) Damn, look at that line, son.
- (Sebastian) That's the line to get in?
- (all cheer)
- They've come to watch us!
- I'm gonna take a picture.
Yeah!
14,000 come to watch us.
Whoo, the lights is on and we're here!
The lights is on and we're here!
You have never been here.
Don't act like you're at Madison Square Garden.
OK?
That means don't come in here with no scared shit.
Yo!
- Let me hold that, man.
- What's up?
- Hold-hold-hold on.
- Huh?
We're here.
We're here.
I'm back in the gang.
Show him the bullshit moves.
# You 'bout to prove my man wrong I'm gonna play this Vandross
# You gonna take your pants off I'm gonna play this Gladys Knight
# Me and you gonna get right
I'm happy and having fun, man, but we got a serious game.
We got a lot of motherfucker hating us today, yo.
That crowd is not here to cheer you motherfuckers on.
They're here to see you motherfuckers go down.
Aight?
(all) Aight.
(all shout "Aight" repeatedly)
(man) Yeah, motherfuckers.
I'm black!
I'm blacker than...
Let's go!
Come on!
- The lights is on.
It's time to perform.
- I got you.
- This is where we wanna be.
- I'm onto it.
I'm onto it.
This is where we wanna be.
Let's go.
I know y'all niggers, man.
Let's get it right, y'all.
We're here today, man.
We're here today.
Let's go, man.
We're here together, man.
Hey, y'all, we're here, y'all.
We're here, y'all!
(commentator) Telfair.
Crossover.
Jump shot long.
Off the glass.
Rebounded by Cardozo.
Ahead they go for the layup.
We gotta pick it up, man.
(commentator) Dwayne Johnson will reset.
Now he spins inside and he gets knocked hard.
And Telfair will be whistled for that one.
Oh, this kid is unbelievable, man.
Fuck, man.
- (commentator) And that's his second.
- Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick.
What you taking me out for?
What the fuck are you taking me out for?
(commentator) Cardozo back outside.
To drive in traffic.
Tipped up and in by Davis.
As we count 'em down in the first half.
Telfair's gonna come back in with two personal fouls.
Eugene Lawrence with the basketball.
Hands to Telfair.
There's Telfair with the basketball.
Off a high spring by Pena.
Behind the back he goes.
Crosses over.
Goes inside.
Floats it up.
It's short.
Got his own rebound.
Put it in!
And the buzzer!
Yo, it's over.
Forget about it.
They're playing street ball against us.
Outscrapping us.
Bennie, you got zero.
We got one rebound, man.
You don't rebound, you're not playing.
You don't rebound, you're not playing.
Plain and simple.
I need rebounds.
I don't need no dunks, no jump shots.
I need somebody to say, "Fuck that, I'm gonna rebound."
Come on, let's go turn it up.
(commentator) Now a pull-up jumper by Telfair.
Hits the bottom of the net.
A steal.
Lawrence.
What the fuck's that?
What the fuck?
And Victor Morris has it.
So Cardozo can take the lead.
Tries to duck.
Great pass.
Yo!
You gotta calm the fuck down.
Calm down!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, back down!
Stay in touch!
Stay in touch!
(commentator) Telfair goes for the basket.
Lays that one in.
(crowd chants) Let's go, Lincoln!
Let's go, Lincoln!
Now, listen.
This is it!
This is it, right here.
- Yo, yo, let's go!
- Yo, we gotta fight, y'all.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yo, right, y'all.
Now, listen, man.
This is it, man.
This is for the history, man.
We's in it all here, together on three.
- One, two, three.
- (all) Together!
(commentator) Telfair drives into the lane.
A little pull-up.
It's good.
Telfair in the lane.
Left-handed!
What a great drive by Telfair.
Telfair there.
Open court.
He's got it in.
Over the top.
Yeah.
Let's go.
(commentator) And a steal by Sebastian.
Ahead to Lawrence.
Here's Boateng.
And he will crush it.
And that should do it.
Clear the motherfucking road, boys!
(chanting and whooping)
Yo, yo, Tiny.
They wrote in the paper that we wouldn't do it.
But we did it!
- We did it!
We went through it, boy.
- We did it!
Three!
Three!
Three, nigger.
Three.
- Oh, Lord, thank you, Jesus.
- We got it.
We got it.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
I love you guys.
I love all of you.
What they gonna say now?
What they gonna say?
"Get Tiny, before you get another championship.
Get Tiny!
"Get Tiny, so somebody else lose!"
Yo, Tom.
This here was a victory lap, and I'm leaving.
(man on PA) Terminal one.
Lower level.
Once again.
Calling Sebastian Telfair.
Your party's plane.
Terminal one.
Lower level.
- What's happening?
- How you doing, man?
I'm not used to being around people that have jobs.
- Good to see you.
- Wow.
Go, go, go.
Can I have one of those basketballs?
- Where do you go to college?
- Louisville.
Louisville?
Tell Rick Pitino hello, all right?
- I'll make sure I will.
- All right.
- Louisville.
- Louisville?
All right.
We'll see.
It's over.
It's over!
- I could be in a magazine just like this.
- Pull the bad one.
- Definitely me.
Definitely me.
- You can't seriously...
Look at that fucking smile!
Look at the smile.
And the number one pick, for the 2004 draft... (man on PA) Sebastian Telfair.
- Congratulations, man.
- Congratulations, Sebastian.
- You got quite the smile, Sebastian.
- Congratulations.
We missing anybody, Lisa?
Dwight Howard?
Al Jefferson?
- What up, country boy?
- J. R. Smith?
You're a country boy too.
Where you from?
I got people staying in New Jersey, so I ain't really a country boy.
You still country.
You know your ass, country.
And shit, you the most country person here.
You, country boy.
If you ain't from New York, you're from the country.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Brooklyn in the house without a doubt.
I'm the baller everyone talking about.
Kansas!
Kansas!
Kansas!
Kansas?
(commentator) Telfair with his first bucket.
Out of Brooklyn.
Telfair signing with Louisville.
Count that assist.
Hey, Coach!
Write that assist down.
Write that assist down.
- Coach, I'm trying to get that assist record.
- I know.
Keep working.
Hey, man, help me get that assist record, man.
- I don't know how many I got.
- I have no idea, but I'll find out.
Run!
Run!
(commentator) Dwight Howard off the great feed from Telfair.
- The record's 13.
- How many you got?
I need four, man.
I need four more.
I'm gonna go back door right now.
I'm there, I'm there.
Jamel, I got you back, I got you back!
Hit that.
Hit my assist, baby.
I'm gonna go crazy in that locker room.
You did exactly what you had to do.
Exactly what you had to do, man.
You're a forward general.
That was fantastic.
You didn't have to score in this.
That's what everyone was looking for.
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you.
I'll see y'all, man.
You see that man dishing the rock?
That's what it's all about.
I just want to say I had a great time with all you country boys this weekend.
Wish we could do it again.
You were tremendous, because you didn't try to do anything except what you're supposed to do, which is run the team.
You played the way a true lead guy is supposed to play.
Nobody does that.
Except you.
- 'Cause you're a pro.
- Yeah, I am?
- Yes, you are.
- I hope so.
(Sebastian) When I got home.
I was at meetings till two in the morning.
Just trying to get the sneaker contract on the roll.
(interviewer) So what happens when you meet with the sneaker company?
I might as well show you this.
When you go to a sneaker presentation, they take you through their whole history.
K.G., Tim Duncan, guys there running, swimming.
And then the last couple of pages is like, "You are the future."
You know?
Then they got a picture of me.
See those guns right there?
Of course, I'm wearing all Adidas right now.
That's that Adidas camp right there.
And that's me in Adidas, with my yellow and black colors.
And those'll be my sneakers right there.
Those'll be the Sebastian Telfairs.
I'm the first person to see this.
No one saw the sneaker yet.
I'm surprised.
I'm like, "Y'all want me?"
"Y'all want to give me a sneaker?" Things like...
Ah, it's...
It's like you see a movie, and you're picturing that's you, and you're like, "That's not reality."
Then it's really, like, right there.
I'm sitting talking to these people.
I'm like, "They're talking about me?"
I'm not dreaming right now.
I was dreaming for the last 18 years.
Like, it's happening right now.
And it's right in front of me.
Yeah, we're gonna have to meet anyway.
Today you got one of the biggest announcements of your life.
I'll put my arm round you, handshake, we'll do a photo op, and then I'll back off again and let you finish your deal.
The majority of it's gonna be you.
They don't like to hear it from these corporate guys with the suits on.
We're gonna head around the side of the building, so walk with me.
Right there, where Ron's at.
How do you want to be introduced?
I mean, do you want Ron to say:
"New York high-school legend"?
"New York high school legend Sebastian Telfair to make two announcements"?
How would you personally like to be kinda brought up to the stage?
Is there anything?
You could say "New York City legend," anything like that.
(Ron) And now, Sebastian Telfair, New York City high-school legend.
(applause and cheers)
Thank you.
Thanks for coming, everybody.
I got a couple of announcements to make.
The first announcement is, I'm the newest member of the Adidas team.
I'm gonna be signing with Adidas.
- (man) All right!
That's good!
- (applause)
And now, every one of you really came here to hear the announcement -
I will be entering the 2004 NBA draft.
(applause)
He brings that instant street credibility.
And so we're gonna...
- Instant what?
- Instant street credibility.
So street cred with the real urban ballers, with the ballers, so we're pretty excited about that too.
(woman) How do you plan on using the college funds?
(Tiny) He's gonna probably go somewhere and work out on his game.
And the world he's about to embark on is gonna be so difficult.
He's still got a lotta learning to do.
A whole lotta learning.
Specially when you got money now.
Now it's really easy to mess up now, because you're financially fit.
Everything you wish for, you got.
Now what you gonna do?
You wished for a car, a house for your mother - you got it.
You wished for your own sneakers - you got it.
Now, what is your intention in life now?
I want him to really realize that he's about to be a man, in a crazy business.
He's gonna go to a company.
And he's gonna be the rookie of the company.
And nobody gonna care who Sebastian Telfair is no more.
Now Sebastian Telfair is going straight from high school to the NBA.
It's one thing to be LeBron James, or Kobe Bryant, or Kevin Garnett, it's quite another to be five-ten like Telfair, with a spotty jump shot.
It's exactly 2:58 in the morning back home.
And we're going for our first workout.
So when I get up, we'll be going to our second workout.
Focus.
(Jamel) That's the reason why I got him out here in Greece.
Just to clear his head.
When I was back home, I saw, like, a confused boy.
And I didn't like what I saw.
He was too Hollywood, you know.
It's good to be in the limelight, but sometimes you forget what you have to do, you know, to stay in that limelight.
So he gotta do this other hard construction work over here.
Little faster, little faster, little faster.
There you go.
Ah.
Ah!
Five dribbles.
No six dribbles.
Five dribbles.
Know you're gonna make the shot.
Never second-guess your shot.
Second guess is don't fucking shoot.
You know how when we used to go work out, and we didn't have no cars or nothing.
You know, we'd have to go borrow people's cars to go work out.
We'd be the best people in the gym, even the NBA players, and we didn't have no vehicle to get around.
Well, I just signed my Adidas deal and I just bought my brother a 645Ci.
Brand-new BMW.
I don't know where it is yet, y'all know when y'all see it.
Soon as we get back to the States, I'm gonna give it to him.
I ain't seen it yet.
I know how it looks, but I just ordered it.
We get home the second.
It's, like, the 20-something right now.
So soon as we get home I'm gonna give it to him.
I know he's gonna go crazy.
Shh!
(shopkeeper) How are you?
(Jamel) That's really sweet, right?
Are you trying it on?
How's it feel?
Is it all right?
- (shopkeeper) You like it?
- Yeah, I like it.
- I like that one right there.
- Nah, that's...
That's...
You gotta be grown for that.
You gotta be at least 23.
- That's real gold, man.
- I let y'all play my budget.
- No, no.
We buy expensive.
- (shopkeeper) Yes, I know.
(Jamel) That's about 18?
18 thousand?
- (Sebastian) That's what I want.
- Not one diamond.
(man) Why are so many high-school players moving?
Because we have a deluded draft pool.
Sebastian Telfair is a young man who I think may be making a mistake.
He is not a lottery-type player.
He is small.
He does not shoot the ball.
And I think he could struggle in the league.
Oh, fuck.
Step off the line, man.
Stop getting frustrated the whole fucking time.
Ah, damn.
Ten fucking shots and I didn't make a fucking...
Fuck!
Can't make a shot, man.
I missed the last 20 shots, man.
- Fucking...
- Well, make 'em, then.
Shit.
Make 'em.
Fix the shot.
You're a pro, fix your shot.
Fix your shot.
There you go.
Shoot like a pro, man.
There you go.
Back down.
Back down.
(Jamel) Pull him, Drew.
Pull him, Drew.
Pull him.
Pull him, Drew.
There you go.
Yeah.
Ten seconds.
- All right?
- Last 20 seconds.
Go.
(Dan) I've been reading a lot of negativity.
You know, there's a whole lotta stress with seeing where he's gonna be in the draft, you know, and hoping that everything works out right.
And my mother, she's scared because my brother Jamel been through a lot of stuff.
She's scared.
Even after the Adidas contract and everything, she's still scared.
She always talks about, "I just don't want them to hurt my baby."
Jamel's saying...
He's the same way.
Like, "I just don't want to hurt him.
I just don't want them to hurt him."
Go, Nico.
You keep playing like that, I'm gonna fuck you up.
- Keep playing like that I'll fuck you up.
- What have I done?
Yes?
Why?
Get the fuck outta here.
(crowd chanting)
You must sign me next year.
I play for you like the same.
You sign me next year, I play the same for you.
OK?
You sign me next year, I play for you the same way.
Bah!
(boys and Jamel repeat Greek word)
(speaks Greek)
- Oh, you like that?
- Oh, my...
Yo, check this out.
We're living good 'cause we work hard, man.
That's all we do, is work hard.
When I buy my mother her house, we'll have a swimming pool that my little sister and little brother will go crazy in.
And that'll feel good.
Follow me on my first...
(man) So the next time I see you, what are we gonna be doing?
I'm not too sure yet.
I'm gonna figure it out later.
Yeah, my little brother got me a nice little toy, you know what I'm saying?
It's called the Little Bentley.
Well, it's just another day in Sebastian Telfair's life.
He gotta prove everybody wrong.
Everybody said he was too small, he couldn't do this, couldn't do that.
Now look at us.
Kid from Coney Island, about to be in the draft.
Making it.
We're here now.
You know what I'm saying?
We're a few hours away.
We're, like, seven hours away from, you know, his whole life gonna change.
Didn't everybody say, "Get Tiny"?
Now what they gonna say?
We got Benzes and little Bentleys and Maybachs.
What they gonna say now?
All type of diamonds and stuff.
What they gonna say now?
They can't say nothing.
You know what I'm saying?
- Yo, this is draft...
- Yo!
Hold on...
You know what I just told 'em?
I say...
I'll put my seatbelt on, before you try to get something on me.
I just tell them...
Yo.
I just say, "They say 'Get Tiny.' What they gonna do now?"
We're driving Beamers, we're driving little BMs.
What they gonna do now, Tiny?
We got all kind of diamonds and shit.
We got all types of shit.
What the fuck are they gonna do now?
Know what I'm saying?
Now we got all types of shit coming through, 'cause we got a millionaire nigger!
Now what they gonna do?
- Gonna tell me ingredients?
- Yes, yes.
Only thing about my mother, she knows how to play dominos.
That's it.
- Dominos.
- And cook.
- Nah, she can't do that no more.
- No, because I'm getting a cook.
We're gonna have a cook.
So y'all come on in, and we're gonna ring a bell.
I'll ring a bell, and she goes, "What you want, Mrs. Telfair?"
So excited.
This is the biggest day in Coney Island.
Little man gets drafted, everything gonna be real smooth today.
- Did the papers have a pick?
- Yeah.
- What pick?
23rd?
- 22nd.
- So who?
- What?
They got 22nd pick in there?
Yo, you gotta get your button-ups.
And get your polo shirts too.
- What pants?
- Bring all the stuff you bought yesterday.
Yo, not the suit.

That's how you work.
That's how you work.
Let's go.
# I stay in B-r-o-o-k-l-y-n
# And I intend to let the whole world know
# Next to blow, go ahead, test the pro
# Got every head nodding till the last one left the show
# And yo, it's been a long time coming
# Been at it too many years to wind up with nothing
# Shed too many tears, and still I hear
# That the future ain't crystal clear, but that don't stop me
# The streets got me, all my peoples got me
# Never by myself, if I ever fell, my family caught me
# Faith in them, and their faith in me
# Be taking me places that I couldn't wait to see
# Making me push beyond my limits
# Beyond the gimmicks, I got hard work in it
# Coney Island, Flatbush, all the way to Fort Green
# Brooklyn got me through the fire, know what I mean?
- # Brooklyn turned it out - # Without a doubt
# Look who's the player they be talking about
- # Brooklyn turned it out - # Without a doubt
# Yo, I'm the player they be talking about
# I see too many dark days that almost got me
# Too many naysayers trying to knock me
# Too many haters who straight forgot me
# But I got too much heart for all of them to stop me
# Too many hours in the power struggle, trying to bubble and come up
# Doubled my efforts, run from from sunup to sundown
# Blinded, shining when I come round
# Blinded 'cause I got dreams of fellers trying to run down
# And this ain't easy, man, believe me, I just make it look that way
# Twisting, left 'em shook that way
# Stay at it till I'm tapping on the door of success
# More or less I never rest until I'm gasping for breath
# And I won't stop till I drop
# Knowing most times in life you only get one shot
# Going all out for me, my family, and my team
# Their love got me through the fire, know what I mean?
- # Brooklyn turned it out - # Without a doubt
# Yo, who's the player they be talking about?
- # Brooklyn turned it out - # Without a doubt
# Look, I'm the player they be talking about
- # Brooklyn turned it out - # Without a doubt
# Look, who's the player they be talking about?
Do not touch.
Danger.
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE
My Grandmother's House
I've lived here for fifty-two years
Fifty-two years, ever since I got married
I've lived here at Jacinto Benavente n. 10, in San Vicente del Raspeig, Alicante
Get out of here...
My husband built the house.
We got married came here to live we were happy for many years, very happy.
Then his company closed down.
My husband got sick,
He was sick for three and a half years, disabled.
It was bad, very bad.
Doctors...
and then we went to Madrid and what do I know...
But then there was nothing anyone could do
Santalma's husband left her when she got sick.
She's been here for fifteen years and her daughters have never come to see her.
This is totally off.
and Marita?
That's it.
You've got two cents left.
I haven't done anything and I'm already tired.
One, there's fifty and there's ten, sixty-five... and the euro and the tip I gave it yesterday.
But I'm tired, Anita, tired...
I don't know what's wrong with me.
You've charged me very little, so...
How much is it?
I don't remember...
Then what can we do?
This is for you...
Alright, then, we'll settle up later.
I'm not going to charge you for the eggs and the lettuce cost almost nothing
Do they give them to you for free?
They don't give them to me for free but the other day you paid
Come one, come on.
No, not like that.
The other day was the other day and today is today and tomorrow is tomorrow
Oh, Lord!
Rat droppings everywhere!
I must change my girdle everyday I sweat too much
I'm going to put a muzzle on you!
My name is Marina Pastor Zornoza and I am six years old.
I'm in the first grade at Miguel Hernandez school in San Vicente del Raspeig, a very big village where lots of people live.
Don'tjump, the mattress is going to give!
Don'tjump on the bed, you'll break it, That mattress isn't like yours
Put your slippers on, Put your slippers on!
I live in a very high flat next to the train tracks.
I've got a lizard, two birds and a cat named "Pitu"
I love horses.
The thing that I love the mostis horse's shape
My grandma told me that when my birthday arrives she's going to buy me a white horse.
Stupid fly is sucking my blood.
From there to there, from here to there..
here...
"our" on the mouth... our...
enemies...
"deliver us from evil" here.
-Deliver us.
-Father .
Father.
The Holy...
Spirit.
And now like this ...Amen Jesus.
-Amen Jesus
Come here or we're going inside
What a girl!
Get on the sidewalk!
I'll open the door and we'll go inside
You're just asking to be taken inside
I'm not so sure about that
And once you go in you're not coming back outside then you'll be crying.
Don't cross again.
Marina, I'm going to lock you inside.
Come here.
Don't cross
Stop...
Give me your hand
You're sweating like crazy sweating and half naked
Marina I'm going to break your arm
Get in, get in!
Leave me alone!
You're hot It's no wonder you're hot the way you've been running around
And you're sweating like crazy ...look at yourself!
I can't wait until this week is over and your mother is finished working
My village is very pretty.
It has a train station, a church, a park, a cemetery, a siding, a factory and a beggar.
My grandmother always gives him money to buy food.
THE NEWS
Come on, open up!
Give me a kiss.
Since Grandma is old she has some really long hairs
Do you have hairs?
It stings you in the face.
Bunion, hammer, chicken's eye.
I go into the bathroom and she comes in behind me
She says: "Why are you wearing two pairs of knickers?"
That must be the girdle and the knickers she wouldn't be wearing two pairs of knickers, Marina
Someday I'll show you Grandma's flower.
Do you know what the flower is?
Huh?
No?
Did you know the contractor called us about the house?
And?
Since the neighbours are going to givetheirs to build flats they wanted to know whether we wanted to give ours
-That's all...
-Oh, Mother of God!
You've really screwed me now, Elena you've really screwed me now
I didn't want to leave here, my child
Juan Carlos says whatever I want to do, because the house is in a shambles.
Well, look, I don't know,
I'll think about and I'll let you know...
No, you don't have to say anything, We've already said yes
Of course, how clever of you
You've already said yes and that's it.
And what if I tell you that I'm not leaving.
What will we do?
Well, if you're not going to leave, then....
Just leave me in here, with all my things and the machine will just have to tear the thing down with me inside
Your poor father, all the hard work that went into building this house.
Working, building the drawers building the doors.
But if he were alive he would see that the house is in ruins and that it would be better to turn it into flats and to have a brand new house.
Now what are you doing?
Does it sting?
When I stretch it.
I'm really upset
Can you believe it?
At my age and with all this furniture and I have to leave here?
My children made all the decisions and you can either leave or you can stay.
-And then the new flat.
We'll all have to be have like little ladies
We'll have to clean our shoes before we go inside.
Do you really think I'll live to see it?
Of course you will.
Sure, it'll take the mat least four years to build them.
No it won't.
Not four years!
"
-Don't get yourself in a tizzy, You won't have to move that much..."
"...because most of the furniture isn't worth saving..." Hold it, hold it."
What do you mean, throw everything away?
.
A new flat and old furniture just doesn't make sense.
-I wish they could make a new me...
-Yes, brand new!
-The prettiest girls in the village!
-There you go.
-It's better than nothing...
I don't have enough.
I don't have enough What am I going to do?
I don't even know what to buy,
I go out for a couple of things and come back with four or five
And that'sjust not on.
A ten, a five... and some loose euros and I've got nothing left.
Not only that.
What have I bought?
If you could say to yourself "I don't have to buy anything else all week..."
I've got the bills straight but the coins the cents and all that I'm not so sure about...
I don't know as wellas I knew the pesetas
This month, I'm not even going to make it to the 20th and that's that
-The twentieth isn't far off
Not too far...
-Do you want the change?
Okay, Marita.
Grandma, are there any rats?
What?
No, not now.
LITTLE RATS
Grandma, is this for the rats?
-Yes

He shaves his beard, he's a real man now
"And he says: "Father, Mother, I want to look for a girlfriend!", tell them"
Don't you want a girlfriend?

And what does she have to be like inside?
Five and seven, now take away three.
I'm one metre, fifty-two or fifty-three cm.

Refuge for sinners Pray for us!
King of the apostles Pray for us!
You ask for whatever you want and she'll give it to you.
Gathered around your table, we've come to remember...
Don't make that noise
Don't make noise.
...Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
The peace of the Lord.
None of the channels works none of them... none of the channels works...
Can you come and see what's wrong with the TV
I don't know, I wasjust sitting there, and suddenly the screen went all snowy and the picture was lost.
Now there's nothing.
I just can't have this, the TV is very old... of course, because it's the only company I have.
Because without a TV,
I'd rather go without food than not have a TV
Okay.
I'll be waiting.
Okay...
Oh, Lord!
I won't be sitting here much longer
Not much longer...
-What a face She looks like her mouth is twisted!
-That's her, homely.
-Who?
Aznar and his wife, Botella.
Oh, yeah!
She's also..
she's fat, she's fat...
Aznar looks like a shithead.
There weren't enough women in Spain, he had to go and marry a foreigner!
Her face is okay, although she wears a lot of make-up.
but her figure... she's had her face operated on and everything else.
No one has every taken a man away from me
Our Father who art in Heaven
"Hallowed be Thy name;"
Thy kingdom come
"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven;"
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, Amen'
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Marita happy birthday to you
Maria... what's the matter?
I ask a girl and she says to me
Sorry, I'm not from around here...
Then a girl comes along on a motorcycle and she stops her and says
"This lady doesn't know her way home"
-I just don't know anything any more.
-Her mind goes blank.
Coming back from the doctor and you know it's straight, but it doesn't matter.
I don't know where I am
-Finally, a man brought me home.
-Her mind goes blank.
My daughter told me that when I get lost, I should stop and stay where I am until someone comes along
-Someone will come along.
if I don't win the lottery to buy a new television
-I don't know what I'll do.
-It's good, Asuncion.-Yea,... really?
-You know I'd tell you the truth
-Anita tells it like it is
If I didn't know you so well, no but since I know you so well
I can tell you it needs a little sugar or it doesn't
But it's good.
Let's drink!
-Cheers
-Cheers
Oh, Anita, you know I start to feel tipsy...
I didn't hear what you said.
-What do you mean?
-I feel tipsy!
It's very good!
-I, I think there must be something...
God... there are so many of us, we've become very bad and God can't handle us
Because if not, then many of the bad things that are happening
God wouldn't let them happen.
Everything has changed so much.
If you danced with a boy, that was a sin, you'd go to hell and burn...
My God!
You went crazy...
A year, two, years, a hundred years if you like...
But never again, burning up at the stake!
But now the world is changing in so many waysthat you don't know which end is up...
Just a while ago someone told me that the Pope said there were no angels in heaven, can you believe it?
-Where do we look for them, then?
-But the Pope said that...
Where do we look for them, then?
On earth there are only devils because angels on earth...
Like the ones who leave never come back.
Sometimes I say to myself:
God, someone must be direct this but other times I say: and what about this.
I don't know.
You know what dishearte ned me a lot
The flat that I rented to thosestudents, One day they came in laughing
"We've just been to the church and the priest had just finished saying mass"
and there were hosts left over so he gave them to us and we ate them.
That was really disheartening!
-That's serious.
-Well, I don't believe in that, Marita
What is that?
That's God?
God is in heavenor wherever he's supposed to be.
But he's up there and those are just snacks
They make them in a factory.
-They're snacks.
-But they're blessed...
And I'm looking at the door of the church and I say well if the King has his bodyguards, and Franco...
And Jesus is there, if Jesus is really there how can he settle forjust a little candle?
To me there's something strange there...
-How many gods Are there?
How many lords?
There's only one God all our lives we've said there is only one God
There's Lord of this and Lord of that...
How many lords are there?
I don't believe like I used to
The father, the son and the Holy Spirit...
That's what I think is the strangest thing
I can't get a handle on that...
-Is the father Saint Joseph?
-No
The father is God, the creator who then sent his son Jesus Christ to suffer for us and then save us
The father and the son.
And Mary is not the mother of God she's the mother of Jesus, but everyone says mother of God
God doesn't have a mother!
I don't want to get involved in all that those are very serious things I believe in one thing, in one faith what's inside the Churchare like photographs and that's it
And the priests are just like other men.
If it doesn't work, it doesn't work...
Maybe it's the antenna...
Of course!
Didn't I tell you?
-Here!
It was unplugged!
-Eat, eat you little rascal.
...called him a little rascal and it didn't even faze him.
"No, I've got a shopping list"
look son, one head of garlic, two bottles of milk and a scouring pad.
Rocio came to the programme to see her dream come true.
Her dream was to get married in the church.
SMOKE
I've never seen it rain in San Vicente that's why the soil is dead.
The rats are very bad and there's one that's very big
It's the mother rat and if it bites youyou'll die because it has venom in its teeth
CONTAMINATED ZONE CEMENT FACTORY
-In all the heat...
-To show the plans.
-I don't care about the plans.
-I just got them this morning.
-But you should see them.
-But I won't understand anything.
You can see where the entrance is.
I don't understand them.
I don't understand.
I don't care about the plans.
You go through that door it's a separate entrance.
Here's the dining room that looks onto the street
The bedroom and kitchenlead onto a courtyard
-And where's the corral?
-Okay the corral, a courtyard... and there's a bathroom here and the other bedroom is here.
And where's the other bathroom?
The other bathroom, here.
I don't want any commotion next week.
I don't know if it's the heat, but I'm tired...
What are you going to do with all the furniture?
-I'm taking it all with me.
-But it won't all fit.
This sofa, the other one in there, that's new...
All the chairs.
I wish I had never said yes
When I died you could have done what you wanted with the house
Because the cancer is not for anyone else but for me.
This has nothing to do with that
That has nothing to do with the stomach.
I'm not making any more coke.
It's so nice in here.
You feel like drinking
"Fry me three strips of pork sausage and I won't have dinner tonight"
THE MOVE
Did you see how thin I was?
.
Sweep it.
No, don't clean up now.
Don't start clearing everything up now
The big sofa from in there.
You've taken my curtains, damn it You don't do what I ask.
You don't do what I ask.
My goodness, everything's out already...
-Where do these chairs go?
-Hi Maria, how are you?
-Awful
Careful with the legs.
Mother, sit down over there!
Don't touch anything, damn it!
Sit down over there and keep still.
Wait, Vicente.
Put the television there.
I didn't think it would come to this and I said:
Tomorrow, tomorrow
No, leave the pillows I can put them in myself
Grandma is worn out.
-Give me the pillows, Rosa.
-Marita, let me...
And where do I sit to eat?
-Here.
-The table won't reach here.
I'll lend you one.
Too many pillows.
I'm not saying you shouldn't have any but the entire house full of pillows...
The trains are very fastand they make a lot of noise but if you're very close the train can suck you up
I've told her that she doesn't have to be alone they take her by the handand put her in the car..
You, Rosa!
And she told me to leave the curtain, in case she gets sick tonight
That coat rack, you could lend me one
I'm not going to put that anywhere...
Three pillows on the chairand six on the sofa.
Come on!
-She looks like she's going to have an attack!
-Yes, although you might no believe it, yes
I hope you never have to go through this.
You don't know what all of this is doing to meat this point in my life
But they're going to give you a beautiful house...
I know, Rosa, I know, That's why I did it because there's nothing here
And for all of us because I know that after they build they won't give you anything for it they won't give you anything.
Everything is nice for you,
what I should have done was stay here
That's what I should have done but it's always the same with me.
Foolishness, allways nonsense...
Smile, you don't have cavities.
Now, how do you get out..
If you hurt yourself, you'll see.
I'm not doing very well today My foot, my leg
I've got a hole thereand I'm in a lot of pain.
...I can't believe the hole.
-When did you have your tooth pulled?
I didn't have it pulled, it fell out.
-I'm going to sleep there tonight.
-There?
Yes.
Otherwise, I'm neither here nor there
I go to look for something and I can't find it
Later on I'll move some chairs but most of it is done.
Have you already left, have you moved?
tonight I'll stay here because last night I didn't sleep
I can't believe how's my house now...
because my house was made of plaster!
And it was perfect, a little hole here and a little scratch there
My God, that house is old Your father whitewashed it...
Last night I woke up with a start because I turned over and saw the white wall and I didn't know where I was
When you live in a house that long then you start to take out things that you didn't even remember existed keepsakes and things
It's hard, it's very hard.
Happy birthday, Grandpa
Cool, clear water water of life, healing water
-water of life, cool, clear water

Eat that little piece you have left!
-It's very hard
-The skin is hard...
You're going to choke, A little boy choked that some kids were leaving schooland a man grabbed one of the boys and then killed him.
They probably took his organs outand sold them
What are organs?
The kidneys, the liver, the eyes...
They're worth a lot of money, that's why the take the children like that.
I think that next week they'll tear the house down
I can feel ityes, I can feel it.
It's the end of the year
Do you have a cold or what?
Of course Grandma has a coldand I'm screwed up
I have a cold and I've lost my appetite.
Eat that little piece of bread.
Don't cross!
THE HORSE
Oh, my God!
The horse!
The cake, the cake!
Come into my home, my lady, this is your real home
There's food on the table and fire in the hearth...
Only God knows what I've done for them,
My son was born there, who'll be forty-three next week
That's where my husband was when he was sick.There are good memories and bad memories.
My husband died at that time there were no funeral parlours...
I had to go through it all there.
-You'll be happy with a brand new house
I did it form them, I did it form them.
We're going to catch you!
Poom, poom, poom, a drum is beating, who'll make it stop no one can work come on Miss shhhh
Don't you have a family?
Then an adult, it was the father, the mother, or me then an old person, I draw a grandmother on the blackboard...
You can draw your own.
What about the hands?
Have you noticed what the grandmother's hands look like?
Are they more or less wrinkled than the face?
-More
-More wrinkled than the face.
Whose... grandmother lives at home with your parents?
-When you were the princess, when you were my passion only you knew that I was poison, poison...
What are you looking for...
Your heart and minego boom, boom, boom...
They invite you to the party in a sailboat, your heart and minego boom, boom, boom... your heart and minego boom, boom, boom...
We'll have a good time, being crazy in the water and a pair of hearts will be drawn without words on the shore of the seas
And you tell me to stop, to stop dancing and I tell you that I can'tI can't stop
Move your belly, move it...
Didn't you get the bed ready, Rosa?
Up, there...
I don't know how but you two have got to find a solution to this
I don't see why se should get angry she's been with us for a while and now it's time to go there for a while with our daughter sleeping here she needs her own room and we also need our privacy.
This has gone on much longer than we had planned and it's got to be between the two of you for us and for our daughter but also for your mother...
The house is fulland we're not comfortable
I'll go see my sister and have a talk with her but don't raise your voice she's sleeping right next door
I'm not raising my voice but the days go by and the months go by and we have to find a solution to this and it has to be between the two of you she's your mother and that's thatI don't think anyone will get angry
I've lived here for fifty-two years at Jacinto Benavente n. 10
NUMBER TEN
My sister, my sister!
Emma!
Emma!
I'll be right back.
She's not breathing.
Watch out.
Come with me.
Don't worry.
She will be fine.
Good.
Let it out.
You okay?
Where's my mom?
I don't know.
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.
Pam!
Pam!
Has anybody seen my wife?
Pam!
We're not there yet...
But I promise we're gonna get you home soon, okay?
Excuse me.
Would you look after the children?
There's something I have to do.
Uh, okay.
Stay with this nice woman.
I'll be back in a minute.
Oh, my leg!
My leg!
Oh!
Is it bad?
Oh.
It's bad, isn't it?
No.
It's not that bad.
I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont.
I was on this run going pretty fast.
I was racing this cute ski patrol guy.
I went off this mogul, lost my edge, and...
- Bam!
- Aah!
Snapped my left leg.
Now that... that was bad.
You a doctor?
A year of med school before I dropped out.
I'm a clinical psychologist.
You saved that girl's life.
Are you a doctor?
No.
Help!
Hey!
I need some help!
There's somebody in the jungle!
He's alive!
Help!
Help me!
Please help me!
Help!
Help!
We should climb up there.
I'll hold him steady, you pull him--
No, no, wait.
What's your name?
Uh... uh, uh, Bernard!
You're gonna be all right, Bernard.
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you.
Is he dead?
I think he's dead!
Maybe we should climb up there...
No!
I need you to focus, Bernard.
Unbuckle your seat belt.
Now grab the branch next to you.
I don't think I can do that.
Bernard, those seats are gonna fall.
Come on, you can do it.
Bernard!
All right.
Hold on tight, okay?
I'm coming up to get ya.
Does anybody have any water?
No, not here.
Couldn't find any matches?
Dry ones?
You can ask around, but I couldn't find any.
It's gonna be dark soon.
Gonna get a signal fire started so they can find us.
- What are you, a boy scout?
- A grown-up version.
I'm in the peace corps.
They still have that?
I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
What's your name?
Goodwin.
I'm Ana Lucia.
I heard that... you were the one who... pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
Yes.
Were any of them african-american?
No.
It's my wife...
I can't find her.
I will pray for her.
Where the hell are the rescue planes?
I will pray for them, too.
Yeah.
What was that?
Libby... watch the kids.
Over here.
It's all right.
We'll be okay.
What happened?
No wallet.
No cell phone.
No keys, nothing.
Hey.
Are you okay?
Hey!
Look, three of the people are missing-- the blond guy, the curly-haired guy and the german who was helping us with the injured.
- Did you see anything?
- No, I didn't.
Where they came from, how many there were?
No, I didn't see anything.
Who are these people?
I don't know, but they're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes.
These people were here before us.
We need to get off the beach.
We need to find a safer place.
We've got kids and people who are seriously hurt.
Where are we going to go, hmm?
How are we going to move them?
And what about the signal fire?
How are we all going to get rescued if we're off the beach?
Nathan's right.
They have satellites, the black box.
We don't need a fire for them to find us.
Yes, we do.
Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication.
We were turning back.
We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction.
They don't know where to look.
It's Donald.
His leg-- the infection is getting worse.
He'll be the fourth to go.
What are we supposed to do about that?
Now come here.
Come on, grab it, grab it!
Over here!
Come on!
Over here!
I got it, I got it, got it.
No, I got it, I got it.
All right.
I've got it, I got it.
Would you like some chicken?
You haven't said a word in a week.
Why aren't you talking?
Hey.
It wasn't your fault, you know.
You were just defending yourself.
- That'll work.
- Yeah.
I heard a pig or something out there.
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.
What?
Where were you?
I had to go to the bathroom.
We have a system for that.
We go in pairs.
Yeah, sorry.
Help!
The kids!
They took the kids!
They took Jed and Eli!
Nancy's gone.
They're gone.
Which way did they go?
Wake up, wake up!
Who are you?
Talk to me!
She's dead.
She's dead.
What are you doing?
Is that a knife?
What is that?
It's a list.
A list of what?
Nine... of us.
Nothing?
They dragged nine people into the jungle, the kids, and there's no sign of 'em?
Now's not a good time to talk?
What needs to happen to make you say something?
!
Hey, calm down.
Let's figure this out.
"Calm down"?
"Let's figure this out"?
Here are the names of every single person they took-- all nine of them, what they were wearing, what they look like.
One of them had a list of us.
They could have gotten our names from the people they already took.
Nobody knew anybody's names the first night.
Maybe they're watching us.
You were gone for two hours yesterday.
What?
- Where were you?
- I was going to the bathroom.
Hey, stop!
We're all scared.
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know anything.
He's right.
Why would they try to infiltrate us?
I mean, that's crazy.
Well, whoever they are, they know we are here.
We need to leave this beach.
You said we needed to keepthe signal fire burning.
I think it's time we let it go out.
Five minutes.
Ah, we've been walking for three days straight, Ana.
And you're still here.
Five minutes.
You know what?
Y'all want to keep walking, go ahead.
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees.
Right here looks pretty goodto me.
Fine, okay.
This will work.
Hey.
Hey.
Back at the beach, the night they came back, you said that Nathan was gone for two hours, that he was missing.
He creeps me out, Ana.
You really think it's possible that one of us... is one of them?
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
Are we really going to be able to catch rabbits with this?
Oh, yeah.
Give me another stick.
Oh, hey, Ana.
Ana!
what are you doing?
You and I are going to have a little talk, Nathan.
You let me out of here right now!
You let me out!
You let me out, or I'll...
I didn't do anything, Ana!
- He wasn't on the plane.
- What?
We were in the air for two hours.
I didn't see him once, not once.
It's a big plane, Ana.
Just because you didn't--
No, I didn't see him either.
And I'm pretty good with faces of the passengers, and I did not see him.
Wait, you're not all serious.
He never talks about himself-
- Nathan.
Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
No.
If he really were one of them, why would he still be here?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Will you let me out?
!
Ana!
You got a problem with this?
I didn't do anything!
Let me out!
Where are the kids?
Where are the kids?
Where are you from, Nathan?
Canada.
What were you doing in Australia?
Company retreat.
- Where are they?
- What?
They rest of your retreat.
Where are they?
They weren't on the plane.
I stayed a couple extra days to sightsee.
How come nobody saw you on the plane, Nathan?
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?
I don't remember seeing you on the plane, Ana Lucia.
That's because you weren't on it.
Where are the kids, Nathan?
Where are the kids?
You're not talking to me anymore?
What's that behind you?
Get up!
I said, "get up"!
- Who gave him food?
- What happened?
I'm trying to find out what they did to us, and you're taking care of him.
I didn't do anything.
And what if you're wrong, Ana?
We don't even know that there is a spy.
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one?
His, Nathan's.
Well, they haven't come since you put him in there.
Who did it?
You?
We're worried about you, Ana.
You've had him down there four days.
I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
You have any kids, Ana?
No.
We should let him go.
We're not savages.
If I were a savage, I would have cut off his finger already.
That's tomorrow.
Grab the rope!
I'll pull you up!
Ana Lucia is, uh...
I think we all think that she's gonna hurt you.
Now you need to get away from here.
There's some fruit in there.
Now just go.
Which way's the beach?
That way, maybe 5 miles.
Morning.
Morning.
Ana Lucia!
- He's gone.
- What?
He's gone.
Nathan's gone.
Ana, what are you gonna do?
They found us.
It's time to move.
What is it?
I don't know.
Some sort of bunker.
Do you think it's theirs?
What are you doing?
What is this place?
Looks like some sort of storage facility.
Hey, come over here.
What was that?
Get it.
What else is in here?
It's a glass eye.
Look at this.
It's a radio.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
The hills are blocking it.
If we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.
I'll do it.
I'll go with you.
Nah, you should stay here, Ana, get this place set up as a shelter.
We can all get it set up.
We can make it back in a couple of hours.
Let's go.
Why do you think they're doing this?
Why do I think who's doing what?
Them.
Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Maybe they're not attacking us.
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.
No real harm done.
Good point.
Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
You know, that first night they took the strongest of us, your quiet friend, three other guys.
They're all athletic, tough... threats.
They didn't take you.
I guess they changed their plan after two of 'em got killed.
You want to take a break?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Can I have the knife?
Thank you.
Where do you think they got it?
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.
How'd they get an army knife?
Sorry?
That knife, it's U.S. Military.
Here.
I'll show you.
You see the tang stamp?
This knife's probably 20 years old.
You don't see these anymore, yet here it is on this island.
Weird, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Ana.
When you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash, how did you...
how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
I heard him shouting from the beach.
From the beach?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Did he see you out there?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.
You were never even in the ocean.
Where are they?
Your friends.
Nathan.
What did you--
If you had cut off his finger, and he still told you he was on the plane,
I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Did you kill him?
Nathan was not a good person.
That's why he wasn't on the list.
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?
The children are fine.
They're better off now.
Where's Goodwin?
We're safe here now.
Why are you wasting your time with that thing?
There's no signal.
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
- It really doesn't--
- Hello.
Hello?
Is anybody out there?
Mayday, mayday!
- Is there someone there?
- Hello?
!
Hello?
!
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?
Repeat your transmission, please.
Hello!
We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815.
Please copy.
We're the survivors of flight 815.
No, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
It's them.
It's them.
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.
No, he said "815." He said, "flight 815."
They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
But what if there really are survivors out there?
There are no survivors.
This is our life now.
Get used to it.
What are you looking at?
It's going to be okay.
What, you're talking now?
It's been 40 days.
You've been waiting 40 days to talk?
You waited 40 days to cry.
Libby.
Turn him over.
Is he alive?
Get Ana Lucia, quick!
Who are you?
Where are you from?
- He doesn't even speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.
Ana, we found him in the water.
He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.
I'm not sure that he's a threat.
He's running!
- Michael, Sawyer!
- Jin!
Others, others, others, others, others!
Others.
- Hit me.
- Hit you?
You think they're okay?
Let's find out.
Hit me.
- Cindy.
Where's Cindy?
- Did they take her?
Cindy!
What was that?
!
You gotta help me!
Emma!
My sister!
My sister!
Emma!
Emma!
I'll be right back.
- She's not breathing.
- Watch out.
Come with me.
Don't worry, she will be fine.
Good.
Let it out.
You OK?
Where's my mom?
I don't know.
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.
Pam!
Pam!
Anybody seen my wife?
We're not there yet.
I promise, we're gonna get you home soon, OK?
Excuse me.
Would you look after the children?
There is something I have to do.
OK.
Stay with this nice woman.
I'll be back in a minute.
My leg!
My leg!
Is it bad?
It's bad, isn't it?
Nah, it's not that bad.
I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont.
I was on this run, going pretty fast.
I was racing this cute ski patrol guy.
I went off this mogul, lost my edge, and... bam!
Snapped my left leg.
Now, that... that was bad.
You a doctor?
Year of med school before I dropped out.
I'm a clinical psychologist.
You saved that girl's life.
You a doctor?
No.
Help!
Hey!
I need some help!
There's someone in the jungle!
He's alive!
Help!
Help me!
Please, help me!
Help!
Help!
- We should climb up...
- No, wait...
What's your name?
- Bernard!
- You're gonna be all right, Bernard.
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you.
Is he dead?
I think he's dead!
- Maybe we should climb up.
- No.
I need you to focus, Bernard.
Unbuckle your seat belt.
Now, grab the branch next to you.
- I don't think I can do that.
- Bernard, those seats are gonna fall.
Come on, you can do it.
Bernard!
All right, hold on tight, OK?
I'm coming up to get you.
- Does anybody have any water?
- No.
Not here.
Couldn't find any matches?
Dry ones?
You can ask around, but I couldn't find any.
It's gonna be dark soon.
Gonna get a signal fire started so they can find us.
- What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Grown-up version.
- I'm in the Peace Corps.
- They still have that?
I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
- What's your name?
- Goodwin.
I'm Ana Lucia.
I heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
Yes.
Were any of them African-American?
No.
It's my wife.
I can't find her.
I will pray for her.
Where the hell are the rescue planes?
I will pray for them, too.
What was that?
Libby, watch the kids.
Over here.
It's all right.
We'll be OK.
What happened?
No wallets no cell phone no keys, nothing.
Hey.
Are you OK?
Hey!
Look, three other people are missing.
The blonde guy, the curly haired guy, and the German who was helping us.
Did you see where they came from?
How many there were?
No, I didn't see anything.
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.
But they're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes.
These people were here before us.
We need to get off the beach.
We need to find a safer place.
We've got kids and people who are seriously hurt.
Where are we gonna go?
How are we gonna move them?
What about the signal fire?
How are we all gonna get rescued if we're off the beach?
- Nathan's right.
- They have satellites.
The black box.
We don't need a fire for them to find us.
Yes, we do.
Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication.
We were turning back.
We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction.
They don't know where to look.
It's Donald.
His leg...
the infection is getting worse.
He'll be the fourth to go.
What are we supposed to do about that?
No, come here!
Come on!
Grab it!
Grab it!
Over here!
Come on!
Over here!
I got it!
I got it!
Oh, no!
I got it!
All right...
I got it!
I got it!
I got it...
Would you like some chicken?
You haven't said a word in a week.
Why aren't you talking?
Hey.
It wasn't your fault, you know.
You were just defending yourself.
- That'll work.
- Yeah...
I heard a pig or something out there.
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.
Give it to me.
What?
Where were you?
I had to go to the bathroom.
We have a system for that.
We go in pairs.
Yeah, sorry.
Behind you!
Behind you!
- Help us!
Please!
- The kids!
They took the kids!
Stop!
I can't find them!
And they took Jim and Eli!
- Nancy's gone!
- They're gone.
Which way did they go?
Which way did they go?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Who are you?
- Talk to me!
Wake up!
- She's dead!
She's dead.
What are you doing?
Is that a knife?
What is that?
It's a list.
A list of what?
Nine... of us.
Nothing?
They drag nine people into the jungle, the kids and there's no sign of them?
Now's not a good time to talk?
What needs to happen to make you say something?
Hey!
Calm down, let's figure this out.
"Calm down, let's figure this out"?
Here are the names of every single person they took, all nine of them.
What they were wearing, what they look like.
One of them had a list of us.
They coulda got our names from the people they took.
- Nobody knew any names the first night.
- Maybe they're watching us.
You were gone for two hours yesterday.
- What?
- Where were you?
- I was going to the bathroom.
- Hey, stop!
We're all scared.
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know anything.
He's right.
Why would they try to infiltrate us?
Now, that's crazy.
Well, whoever they are, they know we are here.
We need to leave this beach.
You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
I think it's time we let it go out.
Five minutes.
- We've been walking for three days.
- And you're still here.
Five minutes.
Know what?
You all wanna keep walking, go ahead.
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees, right here looks pretty good to me.
Fine.
OK.
This'll work.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Back at the beach, the night they came back, you said that Nathan was gone for two hours, that he was missing.
He creeps me out, Ana.
You really think it's possible that one of us is... one of them?
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
- We gonna catch rabbits with this?
- Hell, yeah.
Give me another stick.
Hey, Ana.
Aha!
- What are you doing?
- You and I are gonna have a talk.
You let me out of here right now!
You let me out!
You let me out, or I'll...
- I didn't do anything, Ana!
- He wasn't on the plane.
- What?
- We were in the air two hours.
I didn't see him once.
Not once.
- It's a big plane.
- I didn't see him either.
I'm pretty good with faces, of the passengers.
I did not see him.
- You're not all serious
- He never talks about himself.
Nathan.
Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
If he were one of them, why would he still be here?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Will you let me out?
Ana?
- You got a problem with this?
- Let me out!
I didn't do anything.
Let me out!
Where are the kids?
Where are the kids?
Where you from, Nathan?
- Canada.
- What were you doing in Australia?
- Company retreat.
- Where are they?
- What?
- The rest of your retreat.
- Where are they?
- They weren't on the plane.
- I stayed extra days to sightsee.
- How come nobody saw you on the plane?
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?
I don't remember seeing you.
That's because you weren't on it.
Where are the kids, Nathan?
Where are the kids?
You're not talking to me anymore?
What's that behind you?
Get up.
I said, get up!
- Who gave him food?
- What?
I'm trying to find out what they did,
- and you're taking care of him.
- I didn't do anything.
And what if you're wrong, Ana?
We don't even know that there is spy.
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one?
His.
Nathan's.
Well, they haven't come since we put him in there.
Who did it?
You?
I'm worried about you, Ana.
You've had him down there four days.
I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
Do you have any kids, Ana?
No.
We should let him go.
We're not savages.
If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already.
That's tomorrow.
Grab the rope.
I'll pull you up.
Ana Lucia's...
I think...
We all think she's gonna hurt you.
You need to get away from here.
There's some fruit in there, now just go.
- Which Way's the beach?
- That way, maybe five miles.
Morning.
Morning.
- Ana Lucia!
He's gone!
- What?
He's gone!
Nathan's gone!
- Ana, what are you gonna do?
- They found us, it's time to move.
What is it?
I don't know.
Some sort of bunker.
Do you think it's theirs?
What are you doing?
What is this place?
Looks like some sort of storage facility.
Hey, come over here.
What was that?
Get it.
What else is in here?
It's a glass eye.
Look at this.
It's a radio.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
The hills are blocking it. if we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.
No, you stay here.
- Get this place set up as a shelter.
- We can all set it up.
We can make it back in a couple of hours.
Let's go.
- Why do you think they're doing this?
- Why do I think who's doing what?
Them.
Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Maybe they're not attacking us.
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.
No real harm done.
Good point.
Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
That first night they took the strongest of us, our quiet friend, three other guys.
They're all athletic...
tough... threats.
They didn't take you.
Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed.
- Wanna take a break?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
Can I have the knife?
Thank you.
Where do you think they got it?
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.
How did they get an army knife?
- Sorry?
- The knife.
It's US military.
Here...
I'll show you.
You see the tang stamp?
This knife's probably 20 years old.
You don't see these anymore.
Yet, here it is, on this island.
Weird, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Ana.
When you ran out of the jungle, the day of the crash how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
I heard him shouting from the beach.
From the beach?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Did he see you out there?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.
You were never even in the ocean.
Where are they?
Your friends?
Nathan... what did you...
If you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane,
I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Did you kill him?
Nathan was not a good person.
That's why he wasn't on the list.
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?
The children are fine.
They're better off now.
Where's Goodwin?
We're safe here now.
Why are you wasting time with that thing?
There's no signal.
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
It really doesn't...
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody out there?
Mayday!
Mayday!
- Is there someone there?
- Hello!
Hello!
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?
Repeat your transmission.
Hello!
We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic ﬂight 815, please copy!
We're the survivors of flight 815!
No, wait a minute, what are you doing?
It's them.
It's them.
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.
No, he said "flight 815".
They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
- What if there are survivors out there?
- There are no survivors.
This is our life now.
Get used to it.
What are you looking at?
It's going to be OK.
What, you're talking now?
It's been 40 days.
You been waiting 40 days to talk?
You waited 40 days to cry.
Libby.
- Turn him over.
- Is he alive?
Get Ana Lucia!
Quick!
Who are you?
Where are you from?
- He doesn't speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.
- We found him in the water.
- He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.
I'm not sure that he's a threat.
He's running!
- Michael!
Sawyer!
- Jin!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Others!
Others!
Others!
Others!
Others...
Others...
- Hit me.
- Hit you?
You think they're OK?
Let's find out.
Hit me.
- Cindy?
- Did they take her?
Cindy!
What was that?
You gotta help me!
Emma!
My sister!
My sister!
Emma!
Emma!
I'll be right back.
- She's not breathing.
- Watch out.
Come with me.
Don't worry, she will be fine.
Good.
Let it out.
You OK?
Where's my mom?
I don't know.
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.

I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
It really doesn't...
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody out there?
Mayday!
Mayday!
- Is there someone there?
- Hello!
Hello!
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?
Repeat your transmission.
Hello!
We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815, please copy!
We're the survivors of flight 815!
No, wait a minute, what are you doing?
It's them.
It's them.
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.
No, he said "flight 815".
They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
- What if there are survivors out there?
- There are no survivors.
This is our life now.
Get used to it.
What are you looking at?
It's going to be OK.
What, you're talking now?
It's been 40 days.
You been waiting 40 days to talk?
You waited 40 days to cry.
Libby.
- Turn him over.
- Is he alive?
Get Ana Lucia!
Quick!
Who are you?
Where are you from?
- He doesn't speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.
- We found him in the water.
- He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.
I'm not sure that he's a threat.
He's running!
- Michael!
Sawyer!
- Jin!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Others!
Others!
Others!
Others!
Others...
Others...
- Hit me.
- Hit you?
You think they're OK?
Let's find out.
Hit me.
- Cindy?
- Did they take her?
Cindy!
What was that?
You gotta help me!
Emma!
My sister!
My sister!
Emma!
Emma!
I'll be right back.
- She's not breathing.
- Watch out.
Come with me.
Don't worry, she will be fine.
Good.
Let it out.
You OK?
Where's my mom?
I don't know.
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.
Pam!
Pam!
Anybody seen my wife?
We're not there yet.
I promise, we're gonna get you home soon, OK?
Excuse me.
Would you look after the children?
There is something I have to do.
OK.
Stay with this nice woman.
I'll be back in a minute.
My leg!
My leg!
Is it bad?
It's bad, isn't it?
Nah, it's not that bad.
I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont.
I was on this run, going pretty fast.
I was racing this cute ski patrol guy.
I went off this mogul, lost my edge, and... bam!
Snapped my left leg.
Now, that... that was bad.
You a doctor?
Year of med school before I dropped out.
I'm a clinical psychologist.
You saved that girl's life.
You a doctor?
No.
Help!
Hey!
I need some help!
There's someone in the jungle!
He's alive!
Help!
Help me!
Please, help me!
Help!
Help!
- We should climb up...
- No, wait...
What's your name?
- Bernard!
- You're gonna be all right, Bernard.
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you.
Is he dead?
I think he's dead!
- Maybe we should climb up.
- No.
I need you to focus, Bernard.
Unbuckle your seat belt.
Now, grab the branch next to you.
- I don't think I can do that.
- Bernard, those seats are gonna fall.
Come on, you can do it.
Bernard!
All right, hold on tight, OK?
I'm coming up to get you.
- Does anybody have any water?
- No.
Not here.
Couldn't find any matches?
Dry ones?
You can ask around, but I couldn't find any.
It's gonna be dark soon.
Gonna get a signal fire started so they can find us.
- What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Grown-up version.
- I'm in the Peace Corps.
- They still have that?
I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
- What's your name?
- Goodwin.
I'm Ana Lucia.
I heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
Yes.
Were any of them African-American?
No.
It's my wife.
I can't find her.
I will pray for her.
Where the hell are the rescue planes?
I will pray for them, too.
What was that?
Libby, watch the kids.
Over here.
It's all right.
We'll be OK.
What happened?
No wallets no cell phone no keys, nothing.
Hey.
Are you OK?
Hey!
Look, three other people are missing.
The blonde guy, the curly haired guy, and the German who was helping us.
Did you see where they came from?
How many there were?
No, I didn't see anything.
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.
But they're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes.
These people were here before us.
We need to get off the beach.
We need to find a safer place.
We've got kids and people who are seriously hurt.
Where are we gonna go?
How are we gonna move them?
What about the signal fire?
How are we all gonna get rescued if we're off the beach?
- Nathan's right.
- They have satellites.
The black box.
We don't need a fire for them to find us.
Yes, we do.
Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication.
We were turning back.
We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction.
They don't know where to look.
It's Donald.
His leg...
the infection is getting worse.
He'll be the fourth to go.
What are we supposed to do about that?
No, come here!
Come on!
Grab it!
Grab it!
Over here!
Come on!
Over here!
I got it!
I got it!
Oh, no!
I got it!
All right...
I got it!
I got it!
I got it...
Would you like some chicken?
You haven't said a word in a week.
Why aren't you talking?
Hey.
It wasn't your fault, you know.
You were just defending yourself.
- That'll work.
- Yeah...
I heard a pig or something out there.
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.
Give it to me.
What?
Where were you?
I had to go to the bathroom.
We have a system for that.
We go in pairs.
Yeah, sorry.
Behind you!
Behind you!
- Help us!
Please!
- The kids!
They took the kids!
Stop!
I can't find them!
And they took Jim and Eli!
- Nancy's gone!
- They're gone.
Which way did they go?
Which way did they go?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Who are you?
- Talk to me!
Wake up!
- She's dead!
She's dead.
What are you doing?
Is that a knife?
What is that?
It's a list.
A list of what?
Nine... of us.
Nothing?
They drag nine people into the jungle, the kids and there's no sign of them?
Now's not a good time to talk?
What needs to happen to make you say something?
Hey!
Calm down, let's figure this out.
"Calm down, let's figure this out"?
Here are the names of every single person they took, all nine of them.
What they were wearing, what they look like.
One of them had a list of us.
They coulda got our names from the people they took.
- Nobody knew any names the first night.
- Maybe they're watching us.
You were gone for two hours yesterday.
- What?
- Where were you?
- I was going to the bathroom.
- Hey, stop!
We're all scared.
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know anything.
He's right.
Why would they try to infiltrate us?
Now, that's crazy.
Well, whoever they are, they know we are here.
We need to leave this beach.
You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
I think it's time we let it go out.
Five minutes.
- We've been walking for three days.
- And you're still here.
Five minutes.
Know what?
You all wanna keep walking, go ahead.
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees, right here looks pretty good to me.
Fine.
OK.
This'll work.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Back at the beach, the night they came back, you said that Nathan was gone for two hours, that he was missing.
He creeps me out, Ana.
You really think it's possible that one of us is... one of them?
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
- We gonna catch rabbits with this?
- Hell, yeah.
Give me another stick.
Hey, Ana.
Ana!
- What are you doing?
- You and I are gonna have a talk.
You let me out of here right now!
You let me out!
You let me out, or I'll...
- I didn't do anything, Ana!
- He wasn't on the plane.
- What?
- We were in the air two hours.
I didn't see him once.
Not once.
- It's a big plane.
- I didn't see him either.
I'm pretty good with faces, of the passengers.
I did not see him.
- You're not all serious
- He never talks about himself.
Nathan.
Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
If he were one of them, why would he still be here?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Will you let me out?
Ana?
- You got a problem with this?
- Let me out!
I didn't do anything.
Let me out!
Where are the kids?
Where are the kids?
Where you from, Nathan?
- Canada.
- What were you doing in Australia?
- Company retreat.
- Where are they?
- What?
- The rest of your retreat.
- Where are they?
- They weren't on the plane.
- I stayed extra days to sightsee.
- How come nobody saw you on the plane?
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?
I don't remember seeing you.
That's because you weren't on it.
Where are the kids, Nathan?
Where are the kids?
You're not talking to me anymore?
What's that behind you?
Get up.
I said, get up!
- Who gave him food?
- What?
I'm trying to find out what they did,
- and you're taking care of him.
- I didn't do anything.
And what if you're wrong, Ana?
We don't even know that there is spy.
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one?
His.
Nathan's.
Well, they haven't come since we put him in there.
Who did it?
You?
I'm worried about you, Ana.
You've had him down there four days.
I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
Do you have any kids, Ana?
No.
We should let him go.
We're not savages.
If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already.
That's tomorrow.
Grab the rope.
I'll pull you up.
Ana Lucia's...
I think...
We all think she's gonna hurt you.
You need to get away from here.
There's some fruit in there, now just go.
- Which way's the beach?
- That way, maybe five miles.
Morning.
Morning.
- Ana Lucia!
He's gone!
- What?
He's gone!
Nathan's gone!
- Ana, what are you gonna do?
- They found us, it's time to move.
What is it?
I don't know.
Some sort of bunker.
Do you think it's theirs?
What are you doing?
What is this place?
Looks like some sort of storage facility.
Hey, come over here.
What was that?
Get it.
What else is in here?
It's a glass eye.
Look at this.
It's a radio.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
The hills are blocking it.
If we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.
No, you stay here.
- Get this place set up as a shelter.
- We can all set it up.
We can make it back in a couple of hours.
Let's go.
- Why do you think they're doing this?
- Why do I think who's doing what?
Them.
Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Maybe they're not attacking us.
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.
No real harm done.
Good point.
Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
That first night they took the strongest of us, our quiet friend, three other guys.
They're all athletic...
tough... threats.
They didn't take you.
Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed.
- Wanna take a break?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
Can I have the knife?
Thank you.
Where do you think they got it?
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.
How did they get an army knife?
- Sorry?
- The knife.
It's US military.
Here...
I'll show you.
You see the tang stamp?
This knife's probably 20 years old.
You don't see these anymore.
Yet, here it is, on this island.
Weird, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Ana.
When you ran out of the jungle, the day of the crash how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
I heard him shouting from the beach.
From the beach?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Did he see you out there?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.
You were never even in the ocean.
Where are they?
Your friends?
Nathan... what did you...
If you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane,
I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Did you kill him?
Nathan was not a good person.
That's why he wasn't on the list.
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?
The children are fine.
They're better off now.
Where's Goodwin?
We're safe here now.
Why are you wasting time with that thing?
There's no signal.
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
It really doesn't...
Hello?
Hello?

From the beach?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Did he see you out there?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.
You were never even in the ocean.
Where are they?
Your friends?
Nathan... what did you...
If you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane,
I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Did you kill him?
Nathan was not a good person.
That's why he wasn't on the list.
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?
The children are fine.
They're better off now.
Where's Goodwin?
We're safe here now.
Why are you wasting your time with that thing?
There's no signal.
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
It really doesn't...
Hello?
Hello?
Anybody out there?
Mayday!
Mayday!
- Is there someone there?
- Hello!
Hello!
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?
Repeat your transmission.
Hello!
We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 81 5, please copy!
We're the survivors of flight 81 5!
No, wait a minute, what are you doing?
It's them.
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.
No, he said "flight 81 5".
They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
- What if there are survivors out there?
- There are no survivors.
This is our life now.
Get used to it.
What are you looking at?
It's going to be OK.
What, you're talking now?
It's been 40 days.
You been waiting 40 days to talk?
You waited 40 days to cry.
Libby.
- Turn him over.
- Is he alive?
Get Ana Lucia!
Quick!
Who are you?
Where are you from?
- He doesn't speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.
- We found him in the water.
- He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.
I'm not sure that he's a threat.
He's running!
- Michael!
Sawyer!
- Jin!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Others!
Others!
Others!
Others!
Others...
Others...
- Hit me.
- Hit you?
You think they're OK?
Let's find out.
Hit me.
- Cindy?
- Did they take her?
Cindy!
What was that?
You gotta help me!
Emma!
My sister!
My sister!
Emma!
Emma!
I'll be right back.
- She's not breathing.
- Watch out.
Come with me.
Don't worry, she will be fine.
Good.
Let it out.
You OK?
Where's my mom?
I don't know.
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.
Pam!
Pam!
Anybody seen my wife?
We're not there yet.
I promise, we're gonna get you home soon, OK?
Excuse me.
Would you look after the children?
There is something I have to do.
OK.
Stay with this nice woman.
I'll be back in a minute.
My leg!
My leg!
Is it bad?
It's bad, isn't it?
Nah, it's not that bad.
I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont.
I was on this run, going pretty fast.
I was racing this cute ski patrol guy.
I went off this mogul, lost my edge, and... bam!
Snapped my left leg.
Now, that... that was bad.
You a doctor?
Year of med school before I dropped out.
I'm a clinical psychologist.
You saved that girl's life.
You a doctor?
No.
Help!
Hey!
I need some help!
There's someone in the jungle!
He's alive!
Help!
Help me!
Please, help me!
Help!
Help!
- We should climb up...
- No, wait...
What's your name?
- Bernard!
- You're gonna be all right, Bernard.
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you.
Is he dead?
I think he's dead!
- Maybe we should climb up.
- No.
I need you to focus, Bernard.
Unbuckle your seat belt.
Now, grab the branch next to you.
- I don't think I can do that.
- Bernard, those seats are gonna fall.
Come on, you can do it.
Bernard!
All right, hold on tight, OK?
I'm coming up to get you.
- Does anybody have any water?
- No.
Not here.
Couldn't find any matches?
Dry ones?
You can ask around, but I couldn't find any.
It's gonna be dark soon.
Gonna get a signal fire started so they can find us.
- What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Grown-up version.
- I'm in the Peace Corps.
- They still have that?
I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
- What's your name?
- Goodwin.
I'm Ana Lucia.
I heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
Yes.
Were any of them African-American?
No.
It's my wife.
I can't find her.
I will pray for her.
Where the hell are the rescue planes?
I will pray for them, too.
What was that?
Libby, watch the kids.
Over here.
It's all right.
We'll be OK.
What happened?
No wallets no cell phone no keys, nothing.
Hey.
Are you OK?
Hey!
Look, three other people are missing.
The blonde guy, the curly haired guy, and the German who was helping us.
Did you see where they came from?
How many there were?
No, I didn't see anything.
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.
But they're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes.
These people were here before us.
We need to get off the beach.
We need to find a safer place.
We've got kids and people who are seriously hurt.
Where are we gonna go?
How are we gonna move them?
What about the signal fire?
How are we all gonna get rescued if we're off the beach?
- Nathan's right.
- They have satellites.
The black box.
We don't need a fire for them to find us.
Yes, we do.
Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication.
We were turning back.
We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction.
They don't know where to look.
It's Donald.
His leg...
the infection is getting worse.
He'll be the fourth to go.
What are we supposed to do about that?
No, come here!
Come on!
Grab it!
Grab it!
Over here!
Come on!
Over here!
I got it!
I got it!
Oh, no!
I got it!
All right...
I got it!
I got it!
I got it...
Would you like some chicken?
You haven't said a word in a week.
Why aren't you talking?
Hey.
It wasn't your fault, you know.
You were just defending yourself.
- That'll work.
- Yeah...
I heard a pig or something out there.
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.
Give it to me.
What?
Where were you?
I had to go to the bathroom.
We have a system for that.
We go in pairs.
Yeah, sorry.
Behind you!
Behind you!
- Help us!
Please!
- The kids!
They took the kids!
Stop!
I can't find them!
And they took Jim and Eli!
- Nancy's gone!
- They're gone.
Which way did they go?
Which way did they go?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Who are you?
- Talk to me!
Wake up!
- She's dead!
She's dead.
What are you doing?
Is that a knife?
What is that?
It's a list.
A list of what?
Nine... of us.
Nothing?
They drag nine people into the jungle, the kids and there's no sign of them?
Now's not a good time to talk?
What needs to happen to make you say something?
Hey!
Calm down, let's figure this out.
"Calm down, let's figure this out"?
Here are the names of every single person they took, all nine of them.
What they were wearing, what they look like.
One of them had a list of us.
They coulda got our names from the people they took.
- Nobody knew any names the first night.
- Maybe they're watching us.
You were gone for two hours yesterday.
- What?
- Where were you?
- I was going to the bathroom.
- Hey, stop!
We're all scared.
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know anything.
He's right.
Why would they try to infiltrate us?
Now, that's crazy.
Well, whoever they are, they know we are here.
We need to leave this beach.
You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
I think it's time we let it go out.
Five minutes.
- We've been walking for three days.
- And you're still here.
Five minutes.
Know what?
You all wanna keep walking, go ahead.
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees, right here looks pretty good to me.
Fine.
OK.
This'll work.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Back at the beach, the night they came back, you said that Nathan was gone for two hours, that he was missing.
He creeps me out, Ana.
You really think it's possible that one of us is... one of them?
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
- We gonna catch rabbits with this?
- Hell, yeah.
Give me another stick.
Hey, Ana.
Ana!
- What are you doing?
- You and I are gonna have a talk.
You let me out of here right now!
You let me out!
You let me out, or I'll...
- I didn't do anything, Ana!
- He wasn't on the plane.
- What?
- We were in the air two hours.
I didn't see him once.
Not once.
- It's a big plane.
- I didn't see him either.
I'm pretty good with faces, of the passengers.
I did not see him.
- You're not all serious
- He never talks about himself.
Nathan.
Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
If he were one of them, why would he still be here?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Will you let me out?
Ana?
- You got a problem with this?
- Let me out!
I didn't do anything.
Let me out!
Where are the kids?
Where are the kids?
Where you from, Nathan?
- Canada.
- What were you doing in Australia?
- Company retreat.
- Where are they?
- What?
- The rest of your retreat.
- Where are they?
- They weren't on the plane.
- I stayed extra days to sightsee.
- How come nobody saw you on the plane?
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?
I don't remember seeing you.
That's because you weren't on it.
Where are the kids, Nathan?
Where are the kids?
You're not talking to me anymore?
What's that behind you?
Get up.
I said, get up!
- Who gave him food?
- What?
I'm trying to find out what they did,
- and you're taking care of him.
- I didn't do anything.
And what if you're wrong, Ana?
We don't even know that there is spy.
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one?
His.
Nathan's.
Well, they haven't come since we put him in there.
Who did it?
You?
I'm worried about you, Ana.
You've had him down there four days.
I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
Do you have any kids, Ana?
No.
We should let him go.
We're not savages.
If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already.
That's tomorrow.
Grab the rope.
I'll pull you up.
Ana Lucia's...
I think...
We all think she's gonna hurt you.
You need to get away from here.
There's some fruit in there, now just go.
- Which way's the beach?
- That way, maybe five miles.
Morning.
Morning.
- Ana Lucia!
He's gone!
- What?
He's gone!
Nathan's gone!
- Ana, what are you gonna do?
- They found us, it's time to move.
What is it?
I don't know.
Some sort of bunker.
Do you think it's theirs?
What are you doing?
What is this place?
Looks like some sort of storage facility.
Hey, come over here.
What was that?
Get it.
What else is in here?
It's a glass eye.
Look at this.
It's a radio.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
The hills are blocking it.
If we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.
No, you stay here.
- Get this place set up as a shelter.
- We can all set it up.
We can make it back in a couple of hours.
Let's go.
- Why do you think they're doing this?
- Why do I think who's doing what?
Them.
Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Maybe they're not attacking us.
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.
No real harm done.
Good point.
Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
That first night they took the strongest of us, our quiet friend, three other guys.
They're all athletic...
tough... threats.
They didn't take you.
Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed.
- Wanna take a break?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
Can I have the knife?
Thank you.
Where do you think they got it?
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.
How did they get an army knife?
- Sorry?
- The knife.
It's US military.
Here...
I'll show you.
You see the tang stamp?
This knife's probably 20 years old.
You don't see these anymore.
Yet, here it is, on this island.
Weird, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Ana.
When you ran out of the jungle, the day of the crash how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
I heard him shouting from the beach.
From the beach?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Did he see you out there?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?

I'll hold him steady, you pull him--
No, no, wait.
What's your name?
Uh... uh, uh, Bernard!
You're gonna be all right, Bernard.
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you.
Is he dead?

Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
You know, that first night they took the strongest of us, your quiet friend, three other guys.
They're all athletic, tough... threats.
They didn't take you.
I guess they changed their plan after two of 'em got killed.
You want to take a break?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Can I have the knife?
Thank you.
Where do you think they got it?
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.
How'd they get an army knife?
Sorry?
That knife, it's U.S. Military.
Here.
I'll show you.
You see the tang stamp?
This knife's probably 20 years old.
You don't see these anymore, yet here it is on this island.
Weird, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Ana.
When you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash, how did you...
how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
I heard him shouting from the beach.
From the beach?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Did he see you out there?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.
You were never even in the ocean.
Where are they?
Your friends.
Nathan.
What did you--
If you had cut off his finger, and he still told you he was on the plane,
I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Did you kill him?
Nathan was not a good person.
That's why he wasn't on the list.
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?
The children are fine.
They're better off now.
Where's Goodwin?
We're safe here now.
Why are you wasting your time with that thing?
There's no signal.
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
- It really doesn't--
- Hello.
Hello?
Is anybody out there?
Mayday, mayday!
- Is there someone there?
- Hello?
!
Hello?
!
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?
Repeat your transmission, please.
Hello!
We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815.
Please copy.
We're the survivors of flight 815.
No, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
It's them.
It's them.
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.
No, he said "815." He said, "flight 815."
They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
But what if there really are survivors out there?
There are no survivors.
This is our life now.
Get used to it.
What are you looking at?
It's going to be okay.
What, you're talking now?
It's been 40 days.
You've been waiting 40 days to talk?
You waited 40 days to cry.
Libby.
Turn him over.
Is he alive?
Get Ana Lucia, quick!
Who are you?
Where are you from?
- He doesn't even speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.
Ana, we found him in the water.
He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.
I'm not sure that he's a threat.
He's running!
- Michael, Sawyer!
- Jin!
Others, others, others, others, others!
Others.
- Hit me.
- Hit you?
You think they're okay?
Let's find out.
Hit me.
- Cindy.
Where's Cindy?
- Did they take her?
Cindy!
What was that?
!
You gotta help me!
Emma!
My sister!
My sister!
Emma!
Emma!
I'll be right back.
- She's not breathing.
- Watch out.
Come with me.
Don't worry, she will be fine.
Good.
Let it out.
You OK?
Where's my mom?
I don't know.
She's meeting us in Los Angeles.
Pam!
Pam!
Anybody seen my wife?
We're not there yet.
I promise, we're gonna get you home soon, OK?
Excuse me.
Would you look after the children?
There is something I have to do.
OK.
Stay with this nice woman.
I'll be back in a minute.
My leg!
My leg!
Is it bad?
It's bad, isn't it?
Nah, it's not that bad.
I broke my leg skiing up at Stowe, in Vermont.
I was on this run, going pretty fast.
I was racing this cute ski patrol guy.
I went off this mogul, lost my edge, and... bam!
Snapped my left leg.
Now, that... that was bad.
You a doctor?
Year of med school before I dropped out.
I'm a clinical psychologist.
You saved that girl's life.
You a doctor?
No.
Help!
Hey!
I need some help!
There's someone in the jungle!
He's alive!
Help!
Help me!
Please, help me!
Help!
Help!
- We should climb up...
- No, wait...
What's your name?
- Bernard!
- You're gonna be all right, Bernard.
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you.
Is he dead?
I think he's dead!
- Maybe we should climb up.
- No.
I need you to focus, Bernard.
Unbuckle your seat belt.
Now, grab the branch next to you.
- I don't think I can do that.
- Bernard, those seats are gonna fall.
Come on, you can do it.
Bernard!
All right, hold on tight, OK?
I'm coming up to get you.
- Does anybody have any water?
- No.
Not here.
Couldn't find any matches?
Dry ones?
You can ask around, but I couldn't find any.
It's gonna be dark soon.
Gonna get a signal fire started so they can find us.
- What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Grown-up version.
- I'm in the Peace Corps.
- They still have that?
I'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
- What's your name?
- Goodwin.
I'm Ana Lucia.
I heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
Yes.
Were any of them African-American?
No.
It's my wife.
I can't find her.
I will pray for her.
Where the hell are the rescue planes?
I will pray for them, too.
What was that?
Libby, watch the kids.
Over here.
It's all right.
We'll be OK.
What happened?
No wallets no cell phone no keys, nothing.
Hey.
Are you OK?
Hey!
Look, three other people are missing.
The blonde guy, the curly haired guy, and the German who was helping us.
Did you see where they came from?
How many there were?
No, I didn't see anything.
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.
But they're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes.
These people were here before us.
We need to get off the beach.
We need to find a safer place.
We've got kids and people who are seriously hurt.
Where are we gonna go?
How are we gonna move them?
What about the signal fire?
How are we all gonna get rescued if we're off the beach?
- Nathan's right.
- They have satellites.
The black box.
We don't need a fire for them to find us.
Yes, we do.
Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication.
We were turning back.
We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction.
They don't know where to look.
It's Donald.
His leg...
the infection is getting worse.
He'll be the fourth to go.
What are we supposed to do about that?
No, come here!
Come on!
Grab it!
Grab it!
Over here!
Come on!
Over here!
I got it!
I got it!
Oh, no!
I got it!
All right...
I got it!
I got it!
I got it...
Would you like some chicken?
You haven't said a word in a week.
Why aren't you talking?
Hey.
It wasn't your fault, you know.
You were just defending yourself.
- That'll work.
- Yeah...
I heard a pig or something out there.
Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow.
Give it to me.
What?
Where were you?
I had to go to the bathroom.
We have a system for that.
We go in pairs.
Yeah, sorry.
Behind you!
Behind you!
- Help us!
Please!
- The kids!
They took the kids!
Stop!
I can't find them!
And they took Jim and Eli!
- Nancy's gone!
- They're gone.
Which way did they go?
Which way did they go?
Wake up!
Wake up!
Who are you?
- Talk to me!
Wake up!
- She's dead!
She's dead.
What are you doing?
Is that a knife?
What is that?
It's a list.
A list of what?
Nine... of us.
Nothing?
They drag nine people into the jungle, the kids and there's no sign of them?
Now's not a good time to talk?
What needs to happen to make you say something?
Hey!
Calm down, let's figure this out.
"Calm down, let's figure this out"?
Here are the names of every single person they took, all nine of them.
What they were wearing, what they look like.
One of them had a list of us.
They coulda got our names from the people they took.
- Nobody knew any names the first night.
- Maybe they're watching us.
You were gone for two hours yesterday.
- What?
- Where were you?
- I was going to the bathroom.
- Hey, stop!
We're all scared.
Let's not get paranoid here.
We don't know anything.
He's right.
Why would they try to infiltrate us?
Now, that's crazy.
Well, whoever they are, they know we are here.
We need to leave this beach.
You said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
I think it's time we let it go out.
Five minutes.
- We've been walking for three days.
- And you're still here.
Five minutes.
Know what?
You all wanna keep walking, go ahead.
Fresh water, rock wall at our backs, lots of fruit trees, right here looks pretty good to me.
Fine.
OK.
This'll work.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Back at the beach, the night they came back, you said that Nathan was gone for two hours, that he was missing.
He creeps me out, Ana.
You really think it's possible that one of us is... one of them?
Why do you think I'm digging this hole?
- We gonna catch rabbits with this?
- Hell, yeah.
Give me another stick.
Hey, Ana.
Ana!
- What are you doing?
- You and I are gonna have a talk.
You let me out of here right now!
You let me out!
You let me out, or I'll...
- I didn't do anything, Ana!
- He wasn't on the plane.
- What?
- We were in the air two hours.
I didn't see him once.
Not once.
- It's a big plane.
- I didn't see him either.
I'm pretty good with faces, of the passengers.
I did not see him.
- You're not all serious
- He never talks about himself.
Nathan.
Every time I ask him anything, he just dodges.
If he were one of them, why would he still be here?
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
Will you let me out?
Ana?
- You got a problem with this?
- Let me out!
I didn't do anything.
Let me out!
Where are the kids?
Where are the kids?
Where you from, Nathan?
- Canada.
- What were you doing in Australia?
- Company retreat.
- Where are they?
- What?
- The rest of your retreat.
- Where are they?
- They weren't on the plane.
- I stayed extra days to sightsee.
- How come nobody saw you on the plane?
- I was in the lavatory.
- For two hours?
I don't remember seeing you.
That's because you weren't on it.
Where are the kids, Nathan?
Where are the kids?
You're not talking to me anymore?
What's that behind you?
Get up.
I said, get up!
- Who gave him food?
- What?
I'm trying to find out what they did,
- and you're taking care of him.
- I didn't do anything.
And what if you're wrong, Ana?
We don't even know that there is spy.
Whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one?
His.
Nathan's.
Well, they haven't come since we put him in there.
Who did it?
You?
I'm worried about you, Ana.
You've had him down there four days.
I promised that little girl that I would get her back home to her mom.
Do you have any kids, Ana?
No.
We should let him go.
We're not savages.
If I were a savage I would have cut off his finger already.
That's tomorrow.
Grab the rope.
I'll pull you up.
Ana Lucia's...
I think...
We all think she's gonna hurt you.
You need to get away from here.
There's some fruit in there, now just go.
- Which way's the beach?
- That way, maybe five miles.
Morning.
Morning.
- Ana Lucia!
He's gone!
- What?
He's gone!
Nathan's gone!
- Ana, what are you gonna do?
- They found us, it's time to move.
What is it?
I don't know.
Some sort of bunker.
Do you think it's theirs?
What are you doing?
What is this place?
Looks like some sort of storage facility.
Hey, come over here.
What was that?
Get it.
What else is in here?
It's a glass eye.
Look at this.
It's a radio.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
The hills are blocking it.
If we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you.
No, you stay here.
- Get this place set up as a shelter.
- We can all set it up.
We can make it back in a couple of hours.
Let's go.
- Why do you think they're doing this?
- Why do I think who's doing what?
Them.
Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Maybe they're not attacking us.
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.
No real harm done.
Good point.
Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
That first night they took the strongest of us, our quiet friend, three other guys.
They're all athletic...
tough... threats.
They didn't take you.
Guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed.
- Wanna take a break?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
Can I have the knife?
Thank you.
Where do you think they got it?
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.
How did they get an army knife?
- Sorry?
- The knife.
It's US military.
Here...
I'll show you.
You see the tang stamp?
This knife's probably 20 years old.
You don't see these anymore.
Yet, here it is, on this island.
Weird, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Ana.
When you ran out of the jungle, the day of the crash how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
I heard him shouting from the beach.

You're gonna be all right, Bernard.
I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you.

- What?
He's gone.
Nathan's gone.
Ana, what are you gonna do?
They found us.
It's time to move.
What is it?
I don't know.
Some sort of bunker.
Do you think it's theirs?
What are you doing?
What is this place?
Looks like some sort of storage facility.
Hey, come over here.
What was that?
Get it.
What else is in here?
It's a glass eye.
Look at this.
It's a radio.
Hello?
Hello?
Can anybody hear me?
The hills are blocking it.
If we want a signal, we need to get to higher ground.
I'll do it.
I'll go with you.
Nah, you should stay here, Ana, get this place set up as a shelter.
We can all get it set up.
We can make it back in a couple of hours.
Let's go.
Why do you think they're doing this?
Why do I think who's doing what?
Them.
Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Maybe they're not attacking us.
Yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then.
No real harm done.
Good point.
Why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
You know, that first night they took the strongest of us, your quiet friend, three other guys.
They're all athletic, tough... threats.
They didn't take you.
I guess they changed their plan after two of 'em got killed.
You want to take a break?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Can I have the knife?
Thank you.
Where do you think they got it?
I mean, they don't even wear shoes.
How'd they get an army knife?
Sorry?
That knife, it's U.S. Military.
Here.
I'll show you.
You see the tang stamp?
This knife's probably 20 years old.
You don't see these anymore, yet here it is on this island.
Weird, huh?
Can I ask you something?
Sure, Ana.
When you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash, how did you...
how did you find Bernard up in the tree?
I heard him shouting from the beach.
From the beach?
Why are you asking me about that, Ana?
Did he see you out there?
Is that why you pretended to be one of us?
You ran out of the jungle ten minutes after the crash.
You weren't wet.
You were never even in the ocean.
Where are they?
Your friends.
Nathan.
What did you--
If you had cut off his finger, and he still told you he was on the plane,
I think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Did you kill him?
Nathan was not a good person.
That's why he wasn't on the list.
What about the kids?
Did you kill them, too?
The children are fine.
They're better off now.
Where's Goodwin?
We're safe here now.
Why are you wasting your time with that thing?
There's no signal.
I only turn it on a couple minutes a day.
- It really doesn't--
- Hello.
Hello?
Is anybody out there?
Mayday, mayday!
- Is there someone there?
- Hello?
!
Hello?
!
- Who is that?
- Can you hear me?
Repeat your transmission, please.
Hello!
We're survivors of the crash of Oceanic flight 815.
Please copy.
We're the survivors of flight 815.
No, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
It's them.
It's them.
They're trying to draw us out.
They're trying to find us.
No, he said "815." He said, "flight 815."
They know our flight number because Goodwin knew our flight number.
But what if there really are survivors out there?
There are no survivors.
This is our life now.
Get used to it.
What are you looking at?
It's going to be okay.
What, you're talking now?
It's been 40 days.
You've been waiting 40 days to talk?
You waited 40 days to cry.
Libby.
Turn him over.
Is he alive?
Get Ana Lucia, quick!
Who are you?
Where are you from?
- He doesn't even speak English.
- That doesn't mean anything.
Ana, we found him in the water.
He has a broken handcuff on his wrist.
I'm not sure that he's a threat.
He's running!
- Michael, Sawyer!
- Jin!
Others, others, others, others, others!
Others.
- Hit me.
- Hit you?
You think they're okay?
Let's find out.
Hit me.
- Cindy.
Where's Cindy?
- Did they take her?
Cindy!
What was that?
!
Status report, Cadet.
His shields have a strange signature.
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't care who he is, he's not getting away.
CADET:
This is definitely the ship that attacked Maltese Seven.
Curses.
I had a time share on Maltese Seven.
- He's trying to lose us.
- Follow him and fire weapons.
- I'm just hitting asteroids.
- Keep firing.
[MAN CHUCKLES]
Uh-oh.
Uh, the missiles are coming back.
Um, more evasive maneuvers?
Missiles evaded, captain.
Whoa.
That is one big shiny rock.
[BOTH GRUNTING]
MASATIVO:
Why have you attacked my valuable food source?
It's a big shiny rock that talks.
MASATIVO:
I am Masativo, the living planet.
Those asteroids provide nourishment to me so I declare that your spaceships are too dangerous.
Your skirmish must be settled personally through hand-to-hand combat.
- Sorry, Cadet, good luck.
- No.
The captains themselves will do battle.
Now, listen, you mewling marble, I give the orders around here?
MASATIVO:
You must use my natural resources to defend yourself.
For if you ever want to leave, you must defeat your alien adversary.
Hmm.
Better get cracking.
Wonder where my adversary is.
[GROWLS]
That must be the captain of that mysterious alien ship.
[GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY]
[SNIFFING]
Good luck sniffing me out, pal.
[SNIFFS]
New car scent.
[GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY]
Okay, this will be easy.
I'll use the element of surprise and sneak up on him.
Typical.
[SCREAMS]
DODGERS:
Oh!
Ow!
Oof!
Oh!
Ow!
Hey, not my metatarsals.
Ooh!
Whoa!
Wow!
Ouch!
Oh!
Ooey!
Whoa!
Aah!
What are you doing?
Help me.
[DODGERS SCREAMS]
Back off, buster.
You're supposed to attack the dummy, just like in rehearsal.
These stunt dummies pack quite a wallop.
They're made to withstand rigorous abuse.
So watch out.
[CHUCKLES]
[DODGERS WHISTLES]
Here, boy, fetch.
[BARKING]
Hmm.
My adversary has overpowering strength but limited intellect.
What I need is a weapon.
But where shall I find said weapon?
A weapon, a weapon, my kingdom for a weapon.
But there's none to be found.
So I'll just have to scour the planet for materials from whence I can construct a weapon of my own fabrication.
Yes, there it is.
A perfect specimen from nature's bounty.
That'll make for a great start.
That's weird, all of a sudden I seem shorter.
Funny.
Wonder why that is.
[SCREAMS]
Of all the stupid nonsense.
Hmm.
This one looks straight and true.
[DODGERS SIGHS]
Once you take these things out, they're always a little loose.
DODGERS:
Rings of Saturn musket balls smelted from the dross of the planet's core.
Cotton wadding left over from that stunt dummy.
And Venuvian gun powder made using Mother's own recipe.
Now to load this baby.
[GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY]
Oh, no.
He's made a stick and a rock.
Powder.
Ball.
Wadding.
Ramrod.
Maybe it's ball, powder, wadding.
Then ram it--
Mayhaps it's wadding--
Ball?
Pow- -der.
[CHUCKLES]
Me could watch this all day.
[taz GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY]
This is, hands down, the worst hiding place I've ever picked.
I may have better luck with this creature if I infiltrate and attack from within.
Hmm.
The old traditional duck dinner.
Who can resist?
[GRUMBLING INDISTINCTLY]
DODGERS:
Yoo-hoo.
Dinner is served.
- Huh?
- Hey there, hungry man.
- Huh?
- You know you want it.
Oh, no.
Come on.
I slaved inside a hot stove all day long.
You can't deny that I'm not a magnificent specimen.
I'm free-range.
No steroids.
Um, except for that time I won the Mr. Universe contest and became Governor of California.
All I ask is that you follow your taste buds, bud.
taz:
Um....
[CHUCKLING]
[CHUCKLING]
This doesn't make any sense.
Daffy's bigger than Taz and he's standing there in his stomach.
Well, you know it is a cartoon, son.
- Even so.
- What if they do something visually stunning...
- ...to take the edge off?
- Perhaps.
DODGERS:
Glad I saved these golf cleats.
[SINGING] Way deep inside this monster's gullet
I'm gonna play
[CRICKET CHIRPING]
Once again, I've alienated our target demographic.
Maybe I've gotta kick it up a notch.
[SINGING] Way deep inside this monster's gullet
I'm gonna play Dum-da-diddily-diddily
That's where his guts are churning ever Down where the heartburn lay
All up and down the small intestine Bloated up with foam
Dum-da-diddily-diddily
He's rushing past the point of bursting I think I've broken every bone
Doot-doot
I win, baby.
Okay, Masativo, I won, so let me go.
MASATIVO:
I'm sorry, but I could never set such a clever creature free.
- You must stay here forever.
- Suit yourself, quartzy.
[RUMBLING]
MASATIVO:
What's that sound?
Grinder ships!
No!
Get us out of here.
[ENGINE STARTS]
- Nice work, Cadet.
- Thank you, Captain Dodgers.
I sure am glad we had a contingency plan against living mineral planets.
Yes, I forwarded Masativo's coordinates to the Galactic Shopping Network just like you ordered.
With a crystal that size, they can flood the galaxy with cheap costume jewelry for years to come.
ROBOT:
I'm sorry, Dr. I.Q. Hi, but you're flight has been delayed.
But I'm the keynote speaker at the Interstellar Isotope Convention.
Monolith Space Lines feels your pain, sir but all seats on your flight have been booked by the cast of Britney-mania.
Will that cursed road show ever end?
QUEEN:
Well, isn't this a small solar system?
Hello, Ignatius.
Your flight was canceled too?
Queen Tira-Nee, what are you doing here?
QUEEN:
The Martian Centurions are on strike, grounding all royal starships.
Lucky for me, I had all those frequent flyer miles.
So how is he?
- Who?
- The one who captured my heart.
Dodgers?
No offense, Your Highness, but you could do better.
QUEEN:
How can you say that?
Dodgers is the bravest captain in the Protectorate fleet.
Brave?
Are we talking about the same duck?
He wasn't exactly a paragon of fortitude the time I gave in to his demand to be an ambassador.
He went to the wrong address and nearly met his end aboard a haunted space station.
[ROARS]
[BOTH SCREAM]
[MEOWS]
It's just a harmless little kitten.
Here, kitty, kitty.
[CAT SCREECHES]
DODGERS:
Get it off me.
Get it off me.
Use the paralysis ray.
[PURRING]
[HISSES THEN MEOWS]
Nice shooting, Tex.
- Now hold still.
- Very funny.
[SCREAMS]
[CAT SCREECHES]
[DODGERS YELLING]
Okay, kitty.
Time to go.
The joke's over.
QUEEN:
So he wasn't brave at all?
Well, he did encounter a deadly space vampire, though Cadet actually destroyed the monster.
Dodgers was simply off to the side, dancing around like a madman.
QUEEN:
I'm sure the incident with the kitten was an anomaly.
He's usually very good with animals, isn't he?
Hmm.
Well....
Huzzah!
[EAGLE SCREECHES]
[DODGERS SCREAMS]
Huh?
Leeches!
Come here, my timid woodland creature.
Don't be afraid.
[SCREAMING]
[SINGING] I'm a little daffodil
Strong and proud am I
Aah!
Bees.
Wasps.
Hornets.
Get them off me.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
[SCREAMS]
[SCREAMING]
No, no, no.
DODGERS:
Oh, Cadet, bring the first-aid kit.
Good with animals?
In a word, no.
Well, at least he's a stylish dresser.
Sure, heh.
When he manages to pick up the right suit.
Hello?
Anybody home?
How about a little service?
[SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
You're not the regular guy.
Where's Louie?
I need to pick up my uniform.
Listen carefully.
Need to pick up my green uniform.
Ah, charades, the universal language.
That's a prom dress.
That's a gorilla suit.
Santa Claus outfit.
Wedding dress.
Muumuu.
Nehru jacket.
Karategi.
You know, I have absolutely no idea what that is.
Tuxedo.
Ringmaster's uniform.
Priestly vestments.
Look, I just want my green suit.
[DOOR OPENS]
[SPEAKING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE]
Louie.
About time.
Louie, where did you find this guy?
Ta-da.
Thanks, Louie.
You're the greatest.
Turns out he walked away with a Batman suit.
QUEEN:
So he's fashion challenged.
I know he's a good driver.
I saw him win a race once.
Oh, racers are one thing.
It's the big, slow models he can't handle.
I love being way up in one of these big things.
- It's so much easier to see over all the traffic.
CADET:
Uh-huh.
Wow.
That's pretty steep.
I don't think we can make it.
Of course we can.
That's what this baby was designed for.
Just you watch.
I'll give it a little extra gas.
And we're up.
Oh, dear.
We're stuck.
Never fear, Cadet.
We'll simply use this winch to extricate ourselves from this predicament.
I'll just aim this razor-sharp harpoon at the top of the cliff and pull ourselves up.
Will that cable really hold all this weight?
Of course.
Activating winch.
All right, here we go.
[BOTH GRUNT]
See, I told you the cable would hold.
[CABLE SNAPS]
QUEEN:
Oh, I'm starting to feel like I'm trapped in some interminable compilation of my beloved's secret failures.
Incidents that for whatever reason, most likely time, were never made public until now.
Surely Dodgers has distinguished himself in some other field of endeavor?
Possibly, he's tried almost all of them.
ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to the Lone Star System Intergalactic Rodeo.
It's a spectacular day for bull riding.
Oh, no.
Champion buckaroo Archie Richards has been thrown by the fierce Venusian astro-bull Diablo.
[ROARS]
But rest easy, folks, here comes the fearless rodeo clown.
Hi there, you must be Diablo.
I'm new on the job.
But from what I understand, I'm to lure you away with my clownish shenanigans.
So here it goes.
Care for a drink, lummox?
[GIBBERS]
I'm a crazy clown.
[GROWLING]
Look at me, I'm a silly--
[SCREAMING]
Whoo-whee!
That sure is one ticked-off bull.
Aah!
Save me.
I've always hated clowns.
Yipe!
You've perforated my pancreas.
I quit.
So, Captain Dodgers, what do you know about cosmetics?
- Not a thing.
- Well, this job shouldn't be too hard.
Why don't you start with that client over there?
Aye, aye, skipper.
- May I get some help, please?
- Good afternoon, madam.
Would you like to sample one of our latest products?
Perhaps a dash of this unshakable foundation?
A dose of glittery glossifiers.
And last but not least, a spritz of eau de toilette parfum.
What do you think, boss?
You are so fired.
Come on, boys, we're falling behind.
Don't worry, Mr. Neighborly.
I've got everything well in hand.
Hmm.
- What's the matter, sir?
- I think these glasses are broken.
I can't read a thing.
Maybe you should try reading the front side.
Heh, heh.
Yeah, well....
How could anybody be that stupid?
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe these are, um, those x-ray glasses.
The ones that let you see right through stuff.
[WOMAN GASPS]
And you told me you had astigmatism.
Nobody respects that not-hitting-a-guy- with-glasses thing anymore.
And that's not even counting his failed attempts at theater usher, ocelot feeder...
- ...organ donor, and taxidermist.
- And here I believed he really was a hero.
Oh, now, wait, wait.
He's not a total washout.
I have it on excellent authority that he was a college football hero.
QUEEN:
A football hero?
[LAUGHS]
Oh, Ignatius.
My loyal commander told me the real story behind that.
He went back into the past to make sure Dodgers did not fulfill his destiny.
COMMANDER:
Four a.m., time to rise and shine, sleepyhead.
Two dozen raw eggs.
Plenty of protein to get you off to a good start.
Oh, boy, a bucket of sloppy eggs.
Just like mother used to make.
Mother always used to finish with a chaser of warm, rancid mayonnaise.
[GASPS]
[COMMANDER RETCHES]
Weak constitution.
Just like Mother.
COMMANDER:
I'll place the chicken on the ground and when it scurries, you try to catch it.
What an excellent way to develop my speed and coordination.
Okay, get ready.
Wahoo!
COMMANDER:
Maybe I need to find a more aggressive chicken.
DODGERS:
I got you.
Aah!
Get it off me.
[GRUNTING]
[SCREAMS]
COMMANDER:
Oh, dear.
[BOTH SCREAM]
[BOTH LAUGHING]
Well, that explains his psychotic fear of the clergy.
QUEEN:
Now that we've shared our different perspectives I can see I was a bit dazzled by Dodgers.
I saw bravery in him when there was just recklessness praised his ingenuity when he had survived by dumb luck.
Man, I was a ditz.
ROBOT [OVER PA]:
Dr. I.Q. Hi, please proceed to Gate 7 for immediate boarding.
Well, that's my flight.
Don't take it too hard, Your Highness.
Dodgers does have a certain infectious charm.
I guess that's why I haven't fired him yet.
Ta-ta.
QUEEN:
Yes, that cursed infectious charm.
I wonder if he's busy tonight.
[English
- US
-SDH]
(Seagulls crying)
You see those three houses?
The one on the left?
Used to be a lovely old fellow who lived there, and he had this pretty little greenfinch that used to sit on his finger and sing to him.
It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
(Distant rumbling)
(Glasses tinkle)
(Woman screams) Martin!
Martin!
I've got you. I've got you.
You filthy, stinking dog.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Come on, just give it to me!
(Man) Let go!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Drop it!
(Dog barks)
- l should be in the surgery.
- lt won't take long.
Let's hope her condition is grave.
- This is not an efficient use of my time.
- Come along, Marty.
(Woman #1 ) Mu.
(Woman #2) You shouldn't be on the airwaves if you can't do it properly.
No, I don't take calls in the afternoon.
Oh, Call Nick Wright.
Call Nick Wrong, if you ask me.
I've complained to the Culture Secretary.
Who are you?
Mu, you remember Martin, my nephew?
Doctor Ellingham.
- He's come about your ankle.
- Oh, now he comes.
Where were you yesterday when it was like a balloon?
Yesterday?
I thought this was an emergency.
- l was worried.
- Well, quick about you, then. I'm busy.
I've driven out here to see you when I should be in my surgery.
What do you want, a medal?
I'll take your shoe off.
It's my fault. I left some post on the stairs and she slipped.
- Any sensitivity here?
- No.
- Here?
- No.
- Here?
- l'll, er, go and put the kettle on.
I suppose it's the way of things.
You get on in years, you're...not as sure of yourself.
Maybe slip up here and there.
Start to lose your nerve.
- How long have you been slipping?
- No, not me.
You.
You couldn't keep up with the big boys in London and came back to Portwenn.
You've a mild sprain. I'll prescribe painkillers and anti-inflammatories.
Oh, look at his face.
Reminds me of when I used to spit on my hankie and wipe the choc-ice off your face.
Little Marty. (Chuckles)
(Woman #2 chuckles)
- Keep the weight off it for a few days.
- Sure you won't stay for tea?
Any problems, come and see me in the surgery.
- Mrs Steel.
- Doctor.
So how is she?
Rude, but the anti-inflammatories should bring the swelling down.
No, I don't mean the ankle.
D'you think she's muddled in any way?
- Why?
- Danny, her son, thinks she's losing it.
- l think she's fine.
What do you think?
- She's functioning, isn't she?
Yes, but...
Perhaps if I could tell him that you'd examined her?
Auntie Joan, if you want me to assess her mental state, call the surgery...
Martin, she is just in there.
Um...
Have you any idea what the time is?
Not now you've put something in front of the clock.
- And I suppose that was deliberate?
- Mm-hm.
I'd say it was about...
just after half past eight.
You know when the Second World War started?
1919.
The Treaty of Versailles.
The Germans were humiliated.
It was a sham.
The only place that was ever going was World War Two.
Thank you, Mrs Steel.
- So, it's a pass?
- She's fine.
- Thank you.
- Mm.
- Morning there, Doc.
All right?
- Yes.
Has, er, Paul arrived yet?
- Paul?
- Paul, yeah.
Hello, Martin.
Hello.
- Er, sorry.
You wanna come in?
- Erm...yes.
Erm...
I'm glad I've bumped into you.
I've been meaning to...
As we live in the same village, it's impressive that you haven't managed to "bump into" me before now.
Yes.
Right, well, er...
I just wanted to say...
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry, Louisa.
I know they're here somewhere.
- You were so rude.
- l'm a doctor.
I cannot believe that you'd think it was acceptable to...kiss me and then imply I had a problem, when we'd both been up all night, by the way...
- l've found the, erm...
- ...drinking hospital coffee.
Having kittens over Peter's accident.
And then you start banging on about dental hygiene!
Well...it's not on, Martin.
It's just not on.
- Thank you, Mrs Tishell.
- That'll be £3.98.
Three for two.
- Did you want a bag?
- Erm, yes, thank you.
And, frankly, if that was supposed to be an apology, it was...pretty rubbish!
Louisa, your change!
Oh, dear.
Oh, I only wanted to save her some money.
It's three for two on the, erm...
You don't think I've upset her, do you, Doc...?
(Whines forlornly)
Morning.
Cup of tea on your desk.
Booked in 3 appointments this afternoon, and the lab called about something.
Lots of Latin words.
Couldn't catch it all, but their number is by your phone.
- Who are you?
- Paul.
- Paul?
- Pauline.
Elaine's cousin.
- Where's Elaine?
- Pompee.
- Pompeii?
- Mm, Pompee.
Where Greg's doing Road Studies, or whatever.
Her boyfriend?
So...
I'm here.
- What do you mean?
- What?
- lt's not for Elaine to decide...
- Relax...
- ...without consulting me.
- Elaine's busy. I'm covering for her.
- lt's not forever.
- Would you get her on the telephone?
No. I don't need this.
I'm just doing her a favour.
- l think I've messed up my ribs.
- Who've you been fighting?
- No one.
- Name?
- Eddie Rix.
- Eddie Rix.
Would you go through, please?
- Wallop yourself?
- You stay here.
- Well, I want...
I wanted...
- Stay.
(Door slams)
There you are.
Does that hurt?
Hmm.
- Will it stop me going out on the boat?
- At least a couple of days.
Well, I've gotta go out.
It's all down to me now, see.
I cursed my boys for buggering off to the city, and look at it now, eh?
"Plenty more fish in the sea," that's what we used to say.
Ha!
That is nasty. I thought he'd need this for the shock.
He's not in shock.
Thank you.
Please leave us.
- l suspect you've broken a rib.
- Whoever did that wants locking away.
- No one did it.
- Ribs don't break on their own.
I mean I didn't see who did it.
Some guy jumped me and ran off.
You were mugged?
No way.
In Portwenn?
Cool.
I'll give you something for the pain.
In A E they'll give you a report to bring back to me.
- lt'll heal by itself, won't it?
- Let's see what the X-ray says.
X-ray?
Oh, I don't wanna go to hospital.
It's not that bad.
Ow!
Thanks, Paul, where is he?
Eddie, heard about your misfortune.
Very sorry.
What?
How do you...?
Paul called me.
Nasty bruise, I gather.
Oh, it's nothing, Mark. lt's just a...
It's just one of those things.
You say that, but d'you know how many muggings I've had in Portwenn?
- Go on, have a guess.
- No.
- Guess.
- No.
None.
Not one.
This is a bleak day for Portwenn.
Come on, Eddie, let's get it sorted.
(Girls chatter)
Yeah, well maybe...
All right, Al?
- (Girls wolf-whistle)
- All right, Al?
(Girls titter)
- All right, Paul?
- Hi, Al.
So, er, how was Penzance?
Newlyn.
All right, yeah.
Good to be back, though.
Yeah.
Cool.
You look totally the same as you used to look in Maths.
Yeah.
Just got this cartridge for the Doc's printer.
- l can put it in.
- Oh, I'll do it.
- So, Elaine's gone to see Greg then, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.
- She say when she's gonna come back?
- Few days.
Dunno.
- She leave a message for me or anything?
- Sorry.
That's all right.
- Are you Dr Ellingham?
- Do you mind?
I've come from London.
Do you know how hard it is to get someone in a care home?
- l beg your pardon?
- My mother.
Finally, after months of waiting and paperwork and expense, it's sorted, and I come here, when I'm supposed to be in London, only to find the local GP has scuppered it.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
Muriel Steel.
You gave her the all-clear.
You and your aunt who, quite frankly, would do well to mind her own business.
She accepted she had to go.
Now she's refusing.
On good grounds.
Care homes exist for cases of individual need, and not for the convenience of offspring who live 300 miles away.
Convenience?
Doctor, with respect, she's dementing.
I asked her two questions for testing cognitive impairment, and she passed.
Two questions?
You are joking.
I speak to her every night.
Mostly she doesn't know whether it's Tuesday or Selfridges.
Whose fault is it gonna be when she's hit by a car, or uses a hair-drier in the bath?
Look.
Look, Doctor, I understand you probably meant well, and I can forgive you that, I really can, but trust me when I tell you you've made a mistake.
We'd sort this whole thing out a lot more quickly if you'd admit it.
I attended your mother for a medical complaint.
I also informally assessed her cognitive functioning, and was satisfied that no further examination was necessary.
Forgive me or not, but that is my professional opinion and this is my surgery.
Now I'd be very grateful if you'd bugger off!
Mark.
- Just walk on by, Doc.
- OK.
- Plain clothes.
- What?
Our friend, five eleven, white, dark hoody, has Eddie Rix's wallet.
What's he gonna do with the credit card?
Use it before it's cancelled, and if he does show himself, I'm here.
Right.
Would he use the card of a local man in Portwenn?
He'd go somewhere else.
I think you're missing the visible policing thing.
In times of uncertainty, people wanna see their police force.
- They wanna feel safe in their beds.
- But you're trying not to be seen?
Yes.
That's right.
That's why I'd rather not chat, if that's all right with you.
That's fine.
- Oh.
All right, there, Doc?
- Bert.
- Bit light on your feet there.
- Mm-hm.
So is that, er, sweet Pauline, she settling in OK?
- No.
- Oh, she's a lovely girl.
Dawn and I were in the Wadebridge Water Polo team, years back...
- £5.62, please, Doc.
- Thank you.
Dawn, that's her mother.
Erm, better have some cashback.
£30, please.
Oh, no, Doc, sorry.
We're not accepting cards today.
Dawn is what you might say, er, very motivated.
Right. lt was Eddie Rix who was mugged.
Yeah, yeah.
Horrible business.
Never been lucky, Eddie.
I was not mugged, and you know me.
I should point out that Dawn is very ambitious for her daughter.
Please don't point anything out, Bert.
This is illogical.
It's not, actually.
When Paul was one, she threw her in the pool, trying to make her swim.
- Would you explain it?
- She sank.
Not you.
Her.
What criminal with even half a brain would use that credit card in Portwenn?
I dunno.
But I can guarantee he won't have any joy in my shop.
Can't imagine anybody finding much joy in your shop.
Not if they wanna use a card, Doc, no.
'Cause our card machine is broken.
Right.
Well, I'll just have to pay you tomorrow.
Mr and Mrs Credit have passed away.
Don't mention their name, it really hurts.
Send my love to Pauline.
I might drop up for a cup of tea later.
(Moans gently)
(Man) Just a minute!
Hang on a second!
That's the way, Mrs S. You're doing just fine.
- All right, Mum. lt's all right.
- What?
- What were you doing heading out to sea?
- Hold her, she's very weak.
- (Man) ls she all right?
- Oh, no.
(Mark) Can you go up to the lifeboat house, see if there's some trousers?
- And a towel.
- l need a battery.
- Later.
Let's get you dried off.
- l have to see Mr Monkford.
- He's at the post office, not in the water.
- For a PP3 battery.
- Good God.
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.
- Er, Mrs Steel?
- Oh, you're not Mr Monkford.
No, it's Martin.
Ellingham.
The doctor.
She's freezing.
Right, let's get her inside.
Up to the pub, I think.
Can somebody fetch a blanket?
- Mu.
What's happened?
- l...
- Are you OK?
- l need to buy a battery.
- Can we clear some space?
- Everything'll be OK.
- We'll soon have you in the warm.
- Tosser.
Here you go.
Nice cup of tea to warm you up.
Don't need warming up. I'm not dead.
- Muriel?
Mu, what have you been doing?
- Oh, what's it gotta do with you?
- Mu?
- She's dementing.
Nonsense.
Make sure she's not left unattended.
She's just old.
We all have our idiosyncrasies.
You should know that.
There are idiosyncrasies and there's wading into the sea to get to the post office.
- Danny's seeing if the home'll still have her.
- No.
That'll kill her.
Can't you do something?
It's all arranged.
High Trees will take her.
You can't do that.
It is her worst nightmare.
It's not a decision I've taken lightly.
I've prayed long and hard for her to get better, but she hasn't.
- l can't look after her, I'm in London.
- Well, I can.
You can't.
She needs round-the-clock care.
I'm glad you see that now.
(Joan) I promised her that she would not have to go into a home.
Maybe it's for the best.
Right.
- What are you doing?
- installing a scanner.
Don't touch that.
It's downloading a software update.
Wh...?
No.
I download my own software updates.
Fine.
You have to back everything up first.
Whatever. I did back up first.
I have done this before.
- Really?
- Worked in a surgery in Newlyn.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
Oh.
No, I'm...
I'm not happy with this.
Have you been taking the medication?
- lt's my ankle!
- She's due another dose.
Well, I'll give her something stronger.
Erm, can you supervise the medication?
I'll do my best.
- l'll get a glass of water.
- Hm.
Right.
- She's quite bad, isn't she?
- lt does seem that way.
I thought she was all right on her own.
I mean, I've popped in almost every morning for years.
A gradual deterioration, sometimes hard to spot.
Yes, or maybe it was there and I just didn't want to see it.
Oh.
Look at the state of her.
Well, inflammation in the elderly can sometimes look alarming.
It's not as bad as it seems.
This wouldn't have happened if she'd have been here.
If you're concerned, why weren't you watching when she went into the sea?
This is not the place.
(Muriel mutters unintelligibly)
Who is he?
Excuse me.
Hey, you!
Hold it right there!
(Knocking at door)
- All right?
It's his wrist.
- Hiya.
Oh God.
Was it the mugger?
- No, it was me.
- (Mark) He was wearing a hoodie.
- (Al) Jumped me from behind.
- l shouted...
- Didn't hear a thing. iPod.
- Sorry.
No, I'm sorry, mate. I mean, I dunno, just...
I just, instinct.
- l flipped him.
- You flipped him?
Yeah, landed on my hand.
Shall we...?
Oh, see you, Mark.
Well done, mate.
- Oh, cheers, Dom.
- l thought you were going to hospital.
Paul said you had a meeting at the hospital, so I thought I'd keep you company.
- Well, I've still got patients to see, er...
- Oh, I don't mind waiting.
- That meeting's not till much later.
- No problem.
Oh.
(Mark) Having no girlfriend or family, if I should need care, who's gonna run me to the hospital and whatnot?
That's why you have to cherish your friends, like old Mrs S and your Aunt Joan.
And you and me. I can see us in old age, can't you?
Looking in on each other.
If you get a girlfriend, that'd be fine as well.
Although...
I have to say I admire you on that front.
You're not needy.
You don't pine for the opposite sex.
Are you, er...?
- No.
- Just a bit?
- No.
- No problem if you were.
Still be friends.
Mark, shut up.
- Name?
- Dr Martin Ellingham.
I've brought a patient in with a sprained wrist.
Needs an X-ray.
- Could you see him soon?
- You'll have to wait for triage.
- No, I won't. I've already diagnosed him.
- That's triage.
- Yes, and that's what I've done.
- That's not how it works.
Oh, hiya, Mark.
- Hiya.
- ln the wars?
It's a jungle out there.
- Mind yourself.
- Coming through.
Er, excuse me.
Dr Martin Ellingham, Portwenn.
Mr Rix is my patient.
- Oh, yes.
- Did the X-ray show anything?
- X-ray?
- His ribs.
I looked at his burns.
Are you all right?
- What burns?
- (Pager beeps)
Excuse me
(People cheer)
- Best if we keep this mix-up between us.
- Best thing.
Thanks.
'Ere, 'ere, 'ere, you have a pint on me.
There you go.
Cheers.
- Pauline!
- What d'you reckon?
Good, eh?
No. I can't find a patient's records.
- They'll be there.
What's his name?
- Rix.
- Eddie.
- Yeah.
OK.
You're looking under "R", yeah?
Shall we start again from the beginning?
First name:
Edward.
Yeah?
So, we look under "E".
There.
See?
No, I can't have patients' records filed under their first name.
- lt was good enough in Newlyn.
- What sort of surgery was it?
A vet's?
It's still a surgery.
Learnt a lot there, actually.
Minor ops.
Splints and things.
Could have done that sprained wrist for you.
Piece of piss.
There you go.
Edward.
Did Mr Rix bring a letter from hospital about his ribs?
Don't think so.
Oh.
Perhaps it's filed under "L" for letter.
Or "P" for piece of paper.
- (Man) They've all gotta go on.
- (Woman groans)
- (Man) Be careful.
They're heavy.
- (Woman) I know they're heavy. (Groans)
Easy.
- (Groans) - l'll get it.
- Are you sure?
- l said I'll get it!
Oh, what you done?
(Screams) Eddie!
Oh, Eddie!
Are you all right, love?
Oh, my Lord.
(Woman) I don't know what happened.
He was moving stuff around and...
He has a cracked rib.
He should be in bed.
Excuse me, please.
We still have to make a living.
- Sorry, Doc.
- Were you unconscious long?
- Just a few seconds, I think.
- l'm all right now. I...
- Just a bit woozy.
- Let's have a look at this cut.
(Gulps) Mrs Rix...
- Gloria.
- Could you fetch a drink of water, please?
- l could fetch him his flask of tea.
- lt's for me.
Oh, right.
The blood.
- l told you not to work.
- And I told you I've got to.
(Yelps with pain) Thanks, Doc.
Weren't you worried that a mugger might steal all your fish?
- What?
- l saw you in the hospital.
And I've looked at your records.
You've had a catalogue of injuries in the last year.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- (Man) ls he gonna be all right, Doc?
Yeah. I'd like to see you both in my surgery tomorrow.
- There's a few things I want to ask you.
- l can't just...
Shut up, do as you're told.
- Mr Steel.
- Dr Ellingham, I'd like to apologise.
- What for?
- For my anger.
Oh.
Right.
How's your mother?
She's worse.
And the swelling hasn't gone down.
Forgive me, I called a friend in London who is a GP.
- He says we should have had her X-rayed.
- Should we?
Have you been putting weight on this?
I'm going to write to Which?
magazine.
- She hasn't been walking.
- Sure?
Yes.
- You've given her the diclofenac?
- Twice a day.
Well, I don't understand why the inflammation hasn't gone down.
Have the tablets had any effect on the pain?
- What?
- Oh...
You have been supervising her?
She's definitely taking them?
I bring her the glass of water.
Well, that's not enough, is it?
(Mrs Steel) Can't make me drink.
(Mumbles) What you doing?
- She's supposed to take them.
- l don't want to.
These tablets will help you with the pain and the inflammation in your ankle, but you will have to take them.
If this medication were more critical, your negligence could have been lethal.
- l don't want to go to High Trees.
- You're already here.
I don't drink at night.
If you wet the bed, they send you to High Trees..
- (Danny) lt's all right.
- (Mrs Steel) I have not wet the bed!
(Danny) Of course you haven't wet the bed, Mum.
Shh.
Have you at least seen her drink?
- Have you seen her drink anything at all?
- Not as such.
I drink in the morning, as I always do.
Shh.
D'you have any rehydration salts?
I don't know.
A diarrhoea preparation'll do.
I think your mother's been avoiding fluids at night for some time.
- What?
- She's not drinking.
She's worried about wetting the bed.
Surely she must be drinking something?
Mm. in the mornings.
Joan would take her a cup of tea or two.
That would raise her fluids, temporarily.
Make her lucid.
- l found some.
- Oh, thank you.
- She might not be demented at all?
- Well, let's wait and see.
Mrs Steel, I need to see you drink this.
- No.
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on, Mum, it'll help you.
All right, we need to get a drip into her.
Don't worry.
you'll feel much better very soon.
- Praise the Lord.
- Hmm?
Good dog.
(Mutters unintelligibly)
- Don't do that.
- What?
That.
With that animal.
This is a doctor's surgery.
- Get it out of here.
- You're not an animal, are you?
What's your name, eh?
- What's his name?
- lt's not my dog.
Have you wormed him?
- No.
- What about flea and tick?
I can do that.
- No.
- Takes 2 minutes.
- Get out!
Get, get out!
- (Barks)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ah, Mr Rix.
Mrs Rix.
Follow me.
You've suffered a number of contusions and fractures over the last couple of years.
- Well, not that many.
- l've counted seventeen.
Ah.
Did you have a problem with balance?
Vision?
Hearing?
No.
Don't hear me when I tell him to take the bin out.
- Are you on any medication?
- None.
- Are you a drug user?
- No!
And the burns you went to the hospital with?
- Bonfire.
- Cooking.
- Petrol.
- Hot fat.
- Cooking on a bonfire?
- Barbecue.
Have you always been accident prone?
- No.
- Yeah.
There's a strong possibility you have one of a number of serious conditions which would explain why you keep injuring yourself.
I've spoken to a colleague at the hospital in Truro and arranged for you to jump several queues.
You'll have an ultrasound of your carotid arteries to see whether you've had transient ischaemic attacks, which cause blackouts.
You'll have an EEG to record your brainwave activity, which would rule out epilepsy.
Or not.
But most importantly, you'll have an mri scan which will show us whether you have a primary or a secondary brain tumour.
Well, maybe it's for the best.
Don't be stupid.
Yeah.
She's right, Doc.
There's no need to go to all that fuss.
You don't seem to understand.
If you have a brain tumour, and you do nothing, you may well die.
It's nice of you to go to all this trouble.
Look, have some of my smoked mackerel pâté.
We smoke the mackerel ourselves.
Honest, we understand and we'll think about everything you said, and, um, we'll be in touch.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- All right, Doc?
- Oh, Mark.
How's your wrist?
Fine.
Everyone's making a fuss of me, which is unnecessary.
All in the line of duty.
Look, I was touched by that.
But you didn't actually confront a mugger, did you?
- Technically, no, that's right.
- Well, not technically, actually.
That's only one way of looking at it.
I didn't know Al wasn't the mugger, did I?
So I did confront him, didn't I?
The public likes to think the police are making progress on sensitive issues.
- Makes them feel safe.
- That's better than knowing the truth?
I don't think folk wanna hear our friend hasn't even been sighted.
- Truth is, there is no mugger.
- How's that?
I can't tell you how I know that.
Patient confidentiality.
But I do know that.
So...
I sprained my wrist for nothing?
- Mm.
- But everybody signed my card.
Lucy Holmes.
There's Rick, Bert and Al.
Lou and Dan - that's a blast from the past, those two.
There's young Peter Cronk... lt's embarrassing now.
- Lou and Dan?
is that...
- Yeah.
Louisa and Danny.
He used to bring out the old green-eyed monster in me.
You know, when I thought Louisa was "the one".
Right.
Martin!
Marty.
Oh, Mu is back to her old self.
- Pretty annoying, then.
Mm.
- Vile.
- Good.
- Good?
She's fighting fit.
- l'm very proud of you.
- l'll drop in and see her tomorrow.
No, we're going to fetch her.
At three o'clock.
Yeah, I can't remember the last time I had a conversation with her like today.
It's like she's back from the beyond.
So, thank you.
D'you know Lou?
Lou Glasson?
- (Lou) Yeah.
- Yes.
You forget everyone knows everyone.
- Martin.
- Lou (!
).
We're going for a drink.
Celebrate.
Well, enjoy your evening.
Bless you.
I didn't sneeze.
- (Al) And what did she tell you yesterday?
- (Paul) Oh, I don't know.
Nothing.
(Al) She was on the phone.
She said, "He's too shy."
He always waits for the girl to make the move.
He's always waiting for permission.
And when you give him permission, he messes up.
She said it's...it's pathetic.
Yeah, well, I suppose I can see why she went back to her old boyfriend.
- Morning, Doc.
- All right, Doc?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- (Al) What did she tell you yesterday?
- (Paul) Oh, I don't know.
Nothing.
Thanks for telling me that, Pauline.
She was pretty blunt.
Yeah, well, you know Elaine.
Right.
She said you had a nice bum.
- Al?
- Yeah?
She was right.
Thanks.
(Phone rings)
Portwenn Surgery.
(Knock on door)
Doc?
- Phone call.
- Oh.
Er...
Pauline.
I gather your cousin's not coming back.
Erm, no.
Right, well l...
I wanna be clear, I'm going to advertise her job.
Yeah, good.
'Cause I was gonna say, you know, I can't cover forever.
Oh.
Yeah.
This phone call. lt's urgent.
It's Mrs Rix.
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
We're so sorry to have troubled you.
Another accident.
Now do you see the need for proper investigation?
He's upstairs.
Could you switch a light on or open the curtains?
Oh, dear.
We'd, er, appreciate your discretion, doctor.
What have you done to him?
Well, I was hoisting him up and something gave.
Don't say anything, Doc.
The boys down at the harbour, I...
I'd never live it down.
- ls this consenting?
- Uh?
Consenting?
He loves it.
- My shoulder!
- Ah, yes.
Sorry.
Er, which one?
- Right.
- OK.
Can you move it?
No.
- This hurt?
- Ow!
Ooooooh.
It's your trapezius muscle.
I'll give you an injection of diazepam.
- ls it all the injuries?
- Yeah.
- And the burns as well?
- Mm.
Oh, apart from down on the harbour.
- That was just a fall.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- l'm sorry, Doc.
- Well, you...you've gotta be more careful.
Well, it's just sometimes, in the heat of the moment,
Eddie forgets his safe word.
- Don't tell him that!
- Oh, it's all right, sausage, he's a doctor.
- Well, I should explain...
- No, you don't have to.
Well, we've been married a long time, you see, and...when our boys left home, we needed a bit of spark.
So, you...you don't like injections, do you?
- No.
- Good.
Ow!
And then, by chance, we found this.
Opened up a whole new world. (Titters)
Now there's a spark.
Oh, Marty.
Oh, you look much better.
- You must think you're the bee's knees.
- No, I don't.
Can I see your ankle?
Oh, the swelling's gone down considerably.
Good.
Prescribe a glass of water, and suddenly you're the cat's whiskers.
- Can I ask you some questions?
- What for?
Just routine.
Er, if I had £100 and spent seven, how much would I have left?
It's Wednesday. lt's 3.15 in the afternoon.
Labour is in its third term of power and still hasn't done anything for the elderly.
We are in High Trees, home for old codgers, near Portwenn, and you would have £93 left, which these days, little Marty, wouldn't get you much.
Right.
Right.
Ready then?
I'll put your suitcase in the car.
Yes.
Unless...
What?
Unless you could see about me staying on.
Yes, I know. I was terrified of coming here, and, well, look at it.
I can't think why I was scared.
And, er...more to the point, I didn't know what I was missing.
- Well, I...
I could ask.
- Then ask.
- You're sure?
- No.
There's a lot of flatulence about, and if it gets too bad, I can change my mind.
But, in the meantime, yes. I think I am sure.
Well, I'll...talk to the manager.
Well...
Well, what am I going to do at half past eight every morning?
You've got a farm to run.
Muriel?
Do you want a go?
- (Joan) Good God.
- Please don't take his name in vain.
Oh, Marty.
I know why she was terrified of coming here.
Why?
Well, because I was so ridiculously frightened for her.
is that because you're getting old, too?
Well, I wouldn't have put it quite so bluntly.
Mm.
- Right, d'you want a lift?
- No.
No, I'm fine on my own.
All right.
- Sorry.
No.
Erm...
- l'm terribly sorry.
- Right.
- Thanks.
- Expensive wine.
- Yes. I...
I fancied it.
I fancy an old friend...
I mean, I'm having an old friend over for dinner tonight so, er...
- Louisa...
- Come on, you.
Doc.
Danny.
- l could eat a horse.
Come on.
- OK.
- Right. 'Night.
- 'Night, then.
english HOH
The one on the left?
Used to be a lovely old fellow who lived there, and he had this pretty little greenfinch that used to sit on his finger and sing to him.
It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
(Distant rumbling)
(Glasses tinkle)
(Woman screams) Martin!
Martin!
I've got you. I've got you.
You filthy, stinking dog.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Come on, just give it to me!
(Man) Let go!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Drop it!
(Dog barks)
- l should be in the surgery.
- lt won't take long.
Let's hope her condition is grave.
- This is not an efficient use of my time.
- Come along, Marty.
(Woman #1 ) Mu.
(Woman #2) You shouldn't be on the airwaves if you can't do it properly.
No, I don't take calls in the afternoon.
Oh, Call Nick Wright.
Call Nick Wrong, if you ask me.
I've complained to the Culture Secretary.
Who are you?
Mu, you remember Martin, my nephew?
Doctor Ellingham.
- He's come about your ankle.
- Oh, now he comes.
Where were you yesterday when it was like a balloon?
Yesterday?
I thought this was an emergency.
- l was worried.
- Well, quick about you, then. I'm busy.
I've driven out here to see you when I should be in my surgery.
What do you want, a medal?
I'll take your shoe off.
It's my fault. I left some post on the stairs and she slipped.
- Any sensitivity here?
- No.
- Here?
- No.
- Here?
- l'll, er, go and put the kettle on.
I suppose it's the way of things.
You get on in years, you're...not as sure of yourself.
Maybe slip up here and there.
Start to lose your nerve.
- How long have you been slipping?
- No, not me.
You.
You couldn't keep up with the big boys in London and came back to Portwenn.
You've a mild sprain. I'll prescribe painkillers and anti-inflammatories.
Oh, look at his face.
Reminds me of when I used to spit on my hankie and wipe the choc-ice off your face.
Little Marty. (Chuckles)
(Woman #2 chuckles)
- Keep the weight off it for a few days.
- Sure you won't stay for tea?
Any problems, come and see me in the surgery.
- Mrs Steel.
- Doctor.
So how is she?
Rude, but the anti-inflammatories should bring the swelling down.
No, I don't mean the ankle.
D'you think she's muddled in any way?
- Why?
- Danny, her son, thinks she's losing it.
- l think she's fine.
What do you think?
- She's functioning, isn't she?
Yes, but...
Perhaps if I could tell him that you'd examined her?
Auntie Joan, if you want me to assess her mental state, call the surgery...
Martin, she is just in there.
Um...
Have you any idea what the time is?
Not now you've put something in front of the clock.
- And I suppose that was deliberate?
- Mm-hm.
I'd say it was about...
just after half past eight.
You know when the Second World War started?
1919.
The Treaty of Versailles.
The Germans were humiliated.
It was a sham.
The only place that was ever going was World War Two.
Thank you, Mrs Steel.
- So, it's a pass?
- She's fine.
- Thank you.
- Mm.
- Morning there, Doc.
All right?
- Yes.
Has, er, Paul arrived yet?
- Paul?
- Paul, yeah.
Hello, Martin.
Hello.
- Er, sorry.
You wanna come in?
- Erm...yes.
Erm...
I'm glad I've bumped into you. I've been meaning to...
As we live in the same village, it's impressive that you haven't managed to "bump into" me before now.
Yes.
Right, well, er...
I just wanted to say...
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry, Louisa.
I know they're here somewhere.
- You were so rude.
- l'm a doctor.
I cannot believe that you'd think it was acceptable to...kiss me and then imply I had a problem, when we'd both been up all night, by the way...
- l've found the, erm...
- ...drinking hospital coffee.
Having kittens over Peter's accident.
And then you start banging on about dental hygiene!
Well...it's not on, Martin. lt's just not on.
- Thank you, Mrs Tishell.
- That'll be £3.98.
Three for two.
- Did you want a bag?
- Erm, yes, thank you.
And, frankly, if that was supposed to be an apology, it was...pretty rubbish!
Louisa, your change!
Oh, dear.
Oh, I only wanted to save her some money.
It's three for two on the, erm...
You don't think I've upset her, do you, Doc...?
(Whines forlornly)
Morning.
Cup of tea on your desk.
Booked in 3 appointments this afternoon, and the lab called about something.
Lots of Latin words.
Couldn't catch it all, but their number is by your phone.
- Who are you?
- Paul.
- Paul?
- Pauline.
Elaine's cousin.
- Where's Elaine?
- Pompee.
- Pompeii?
- Mm, Pompee.
Where Greg's doing Road Studies, or whatever.
Her boyfriend?
So...
I'm here.
- What do you mean?
- What?
- lt's not for Elaine to decide...
- Relax...
- ...without consulting me.
- Elaine's busy. I'm covering for her.
- lt's not forever.
- Would you get her on the telephone?
No. I don't need this. I'm just doing her a favour.
- l think I've messed up my ribs.
- Who've you been fighting?
- No one.
- Name?
- Eddie Rix.
- Eddie Rix.
Would you go through, please?
- Wallop yourself?
- You stay here.
- Well, I want...
I wanted...
- Stay.
(Door slams)
There you are.
Does that hurt?
Hmm.
- Will it stop me going out on the boat?
- At least a couple of days.
Well, I've gotta go out.
It's all down to me now, see.
I cursed my boys for buggering off to the city, and look at it now, eh?
"Plenty more fish in the sea," that's what we used to say.
Ha!
That is nasty. I thought he'd need this for the shock.
He's not in shock.
Thank you.
Please leave us.
- l suspect you've broken a rib.
- Whoever did that wants locking away.
- No one did it.
- Ribs don't break on their own.
I mean I didn't see who did it.
Some guy jumped me and ran off.
You were mugged?
No way.
In Portwenn?
Cool.
I'll give you something for the pain.
In A E they'll give you a report to bring back to me.
- lt'll heal by itself, won't it?
- Let's see what the X-ray says.
X-ray?
Oh, I don't wanna go to hospital. lt's not that bad.
Ow!
Thanks, Paul, where is he?
Eddie, heard about your misfortune.
Very sorry.
What?
How do you...?
Paul called me.
Nasty bruise, I gather.
Oh, it's nothing, Mark. lt's just a...
It's just one of those things.
You say that, but d'you know how many muggings I've had in Portwenn?
- Go on, have a guess.
- No.
- Guess.
- No.
None.
Not one.
This is a bleak day for Portwenn.
Come on, Eddie, let's get it sorted.
(Girls chatter)
Yeah, well maybe...
All right, Al?
- (Girls wolf-whistle)
- All right, Al?
(Girls titter)
- All right, Paul?
- Hi, Al.
So, er, how was Penzance?
Newlyn.
All right, yeah.
Good to be back, though.
Yeah.
Cool.
You look totally the same as you used to look in Maths.
Yeah.
Just got this cartridge for the Doc's printer.
- l can put it in.
- Oh, I'll do it.
- So, Elaine's gone to see Greg then, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.
- She say when she's gonna come back?
- Few days.
Dunno.
- She leave a message for me or anything?
- Sorry.
That's all right.
- Are you Dr Ellingham?
- Do you mind?
I've come from London.
Do you know how hard it is to get someone in a care home?
- l beg your pardon?
- My mother.
Finally, after months of waiting and paperwork and expense, it's sorted, and I come here, when I'm supposed to be in London, only to find the local GP has scuppered it.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
Muriel Steel.
You gave her the all-clear.
You and your aunt who, quite frankly, would do well to mind her own business.
She accepted she had to go.
Now she's refusing.
On good grounds.
Care homes exist for cases of individual need, and not for the convenience of offspring who live 300 miles away.
Convenience?
Doctor, with respect, she's dementing.
I asked her two questions for testing cognitive impairment, and she passed.
Two questions?
You are joking.
I speak to her every night.
Mostly she doesn't know whether it's Tuesday or Selfridges.
Whose fault is it gonna be when she's hit by a car, or uses a hair-drier in the bath?
Look.
Look, Doctor, I understand you probably meant well, and I can forgive you that, I really can, but trust me when I tell you you've made a mistake.
We'd sort this whole thing out a lot more quickly if you'd admit it.
I attended your mother for a medical complaint.
I also informally assessed her cognitive functioning, and was satisfied that no further examination was necessary.
Forgive me or not, but that is my professional opinion and this is my surgery.
Now I'd be very grateful if you'd bugger off!
Mark.
- Just walk on by, Doc.
- OK.
- Plain clothes.
- What?
Our friend, five eleven, white, dark hoody, has Eddie Rix's wallet.
What's he gonna do with the credit card?
Use it before it's cancelled, and if he does show himself, I'm here.
Right.
Would he use the card of a local man in Portwenn?
He'd go somewhere else.
I think you're missing the visible policing thing.
In times of uncertainty, people wanna see their police force.
- They wanna feel safe in their beds.
- But you're trying not to be seen?
Yes.
That's right.
That's why I'd rather not chat, if that's all right with you.
That's fine.
- Oh.
All right, there, Doc?
- Bert.
- Bit light on your feet there.
- Mm-hm.
So is that, er, sweet Pauline, she settling in OK?
- No.
- Oh, she's a lovely girl.
Dawn and I were in the Wadebridge Water Polo team, years back...
- £5.62, please, Doc.
- Thank you.
Dawn, that's her mother.
Erm, better have some cashback. £30, please.
Oh, no, Doc, sorry.
We're not accepting cards today.
Dawn is what you might say, er, very motivated.
Right. lt was Eddie Rix who was mugged.
Yeah, yeah.
Horrible business.
Never been lucky, Eddie.
I was not mugged, and you know me.
I should point out that Dawn is very ambitious for her daughter.
Please don't point anything out, Bert.
This is illogical.
It's not, actually.
When Paul was one, she threw her in the pool, trying to make her swim.
- Would you explain it?
- She sank.
Not you.
Her.
What criminal with even half a brain would use that credit card in Portwenn?
I dunno.
But I can guarantee he won't have any joy in my shop.
Can't imagine anybody finding much joy in your shop.
Not if they wanna use a card, Doc, no. 'Cause our card machine is broken.
Right.
Well, I'll just have to pay you tomorrow.
Mr and Mrs Credit have passed away.
Don't mention their name, it really hurts.
Send my love to Pauline. I might drop up for a cup of tea later.
(Moans gently)
(Man) Just a minute!
Hang on a second!
That's the way, Mrs S. You're doing just fine.
- All right, Mum. lt's all right.
- What?
- What were you doing heading out to sea?
- Hold her, she's very weak.
- (Man) ls she all right?
- Oh, no.
(Mark) Can you go up to the lifeboat house, see if there's some trousers?
- And a towel.
- l need a battery.
- Later.
Let's get you dried off.
- l have to see Mr Monkford.
- He's at the post office, not in the water.
- For a PP3 battery.
- Good God.
- Don't take the Lord's name in vain.
- Er, Mrs Steel?
- Oh, you're not Mr Monkford.
No, it's Martin.
Ellingham.
The doctor.
She's freezing.
Right, let's get her inside.
Up to the pub, I think.
Can somebody fetch a blanket?
- Mu.
What's happened?
- l...
- Are you OK?
- l need to buy a battery.
- Can we clear some space?
- Everything'll be OK.
- We'll soon have you in the warm.
- Tosser.
Here you go.
Nice cup of tea to warm you up.
Don't need warming up. I'm not dead.
- Muriel?
Mu, what have you been doing?
- Oh, what's it gotta do with you?
- Mu?
- She's dementing.
Nonsense.
Make sure she's not left unattended.
She's just old.
We all have our idiosyncrasies.
You should know that.
There are idiosyncrasies and there's wading into the sea to get to the post office.
- Danny's seeing if the home'll still have her.
- No.
That'll kill her.
Can't you do something?
It's all arranged.
High Trees will take her.
You can't do that. lt is her worst nightmare.
It's not a decision I've taken lightly.
I've prayed long and hard for her to get better, but she hasn't.
- l can't look after her, I'm in London.
- Well, I can.
You can't.
She needs round-the-clock care.
I'm glad you see that now.
(Joan) I promised her that she would not have to go into a home.
Maybe it's for the best.
Right.
- What are you doing?
- installing a scanner.
Don't touch that. lt's downloading a software update.
Wh...?
No. I download my own software updates.
Fine.
You have to back everything up first.
Whatever. I did back up first. I have done this before.
- Really?
- Worked in a surgery in Newlyn.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
Oh.
No, I'm...
I'm not happy with this.
Have you been taking the medication?
- lt's my ankle!
- She's due another dose.
Well, I'll give her something stronger.
Erm, can you supervise the medication?
I'll do my best.
- l'll get a glass of water.
- Hm.
Right.
- She's quite bad, isn't she?
- lt does seem that way.
I thought she was all right on her own.
I mean, I've popped in almost every morning for years.
A gradual deterioration, sometimes hard to spot.
Yes, or maybe it was there and I just didn't want to see it.
Oh.
Look at the state of her.
Well, inflammation in the elderly can sometimes look alarming.
It's not as bad as it seems.
This wouldn't have happened if she'd have been here.
If you're concerned, why weren't you watching when she went into the sea?
This is not the place.
(Muriel mutters unintelligibly)
Who is he?
Excuse me.
Hey, you!
Hold it right there!
(Knocking at door)
- All right?
It's his wrist.
- Hiya.
Oh God.
Was it the mugger?
- No, it was me.
- (Mark) He was wearing a hoodie.
- (Al) Jumped me from behind.
- l shouted...
- Didn't hear a thing. iPod.
- Sorry.
No, I'm sorry, mate. I mean, I dunno, just...
I just, instinct.
- l flipped him.
- You flipped him?
Yeah, landed on my hand.
Shall we...?
Oh, see you, Mark.
Well done, mate.
- Oh, cheers, Dom.
- l thought you were going to hospital.
Paul said you had a meeting at the hospital, so I thought I'd keep you company.
- Well, I've still got patients to see, er...
- Oh, I don't mind waiting.
- That meeting's not till much later.
- No problem.
Oh.
(Mark) Having no girlfriend or family, if I should need care, who's gonna run me to the hospital and whatnot?
That's why you have to cherish your friends, like old Mrs S and your Aunt Joan.
And you and me. I can see us in old age, can't you?
Looking in on each other.
If you get a girlfriend, that'd be fine as well.
Although...
I have to say I admire you on that front.
You're not needy.
You don't pine for the opposite sex.
Are you, er...?
- No.
- Just a bit?
- No.
- No problem if you were.
Still be friends.
Mark, shut up.
- Name?
- Dr Martin Ellingham.
I've brought a patient in with a sprained wrist.
Needs an X-ray.
- Could you see him soon?
- You'll have to wait for triage.
- No, I won't. I've already diagnosed him.
- That's triage.
- Yes, and that's what I've done.
- That's not how it works.
Oh, hiya, Mark.
- Hiya.
- ln the wars?
It's a jungle out there.
- Mind yourself.
- Coming through.
Er, excuse me.
Dr Martin Ellingham, Portwenn.
Mr Rix is my patient.
- Oh, yes.
- Did the X-ray show anything?
- X-ray?
- His ribs.
I looked at his burns.
Are you all right?
- What burns?
- (Pager beeps)
Excuse me
(People cheer)
- Best if we keep this mix-up between us.
- Best thing.
Thanks.
'Ere, 'ere, 'ere, you have a pint on me.
There you go.
Cheers.
- Pauline!
- What d'you reckon?
Good, eh?
No. I can't find a patient's records.
- They'll be there.
What's his name?
- Rix.
- Eddie.
- Yeah.
OK.
You're looking under "R", yeah?
Shall we start again from the beginning?
First name:
Edward.
Yeah?
So, we look under "E".
There.
See?
No, I can't have patients' records filed under their first name.
- lt was good enough in Newlyn.
- What sort of surgery was it?
A vet's?
It's still a surgery.
Learnt a lot there, actually.
Minor ops.
Splints and things.
Could have done that sprained wrist for you.
Piece of piss.
There you go.
Edward.
Did Mr Rix bring a letter from hospital about his ribs?
Don't think so.
Oh.
Perhaps it's filed under "L" for letter.
Or "P" for piece of paper.
- (Man) They've all gotta go on.
- (Woman groans)
- (Man) Be careful.
They're heavy.
- (Woman) I know they're heavy. (Groans)
Easy.
- (Groans) - l'll get it.
- Are you sure?
- l said I'll get it!
Oh, what you done?
(Screams) Eddie!
Oh, Eddie!
Are you all right, love?
Oh, my Lord.
(Woman) I don't know what happened.
He was moving stuff around and...
He has a cracked rib.
He should be in bed.
Excuse me, please.
We still have to make a living.
- Sorry, Doc.
- Were you unconscious long?
- Just a few seconds, I think.
- l'm all right now. I...
- Just a bit woozy.
- Let's have a look at this cut.
(Gulps) Mrs Rix...
- Gloria.
- Could you fetch a drink of water, please?
- l could fetch him his flask of tea.
- lt's for me.
Oh, right.
The blood.
- l told you not to work.
- And I told you I've got to.
(Yelps with pain) Thanks, Doc.
Weren't you worried that a mugger might steal all your fish?
- What?
- l saw you in the hospital.
And I've looked at your records.
You've had a catalogue of injuries in the last year.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- (Man) ls he gonna be all right, Doc?
Yeah. I'd like to see you both in my surgery tomorrow.
- There's a few things I want to ask you.
- l can't just...
Shut up, do as you're told.
- Mr Steel.
- Dr Ellingham, I'd like to apologise.
- What for?
- For my anger.
Oh.
Right.
How's your mother?
She's worse.
And the swelling hasn't gone down.
Forgive me, I called a friend in London who is a GP.
- He says we should have had her X-rayed.
- Should we?
Have you been putting weight on this?
I'm going to write to Which?
magazine.
- She hasn't been walking.
- Sure?
Yes.
- You've given her the diclofenac?
- Twice a day.
Well, I don't understand why the inflammation hasn't gone down.
Have the tablets had any effect on the pain?
- What?
- Oh...
You have been supervising her?
She's definitely taking them?
I bring her the glass of water.
Well, that's not enough, is it?
(Mrs Steel) Can't make me drink.
(Mumbles) What you doing?
- She's supposed to take them.
- l don't want to.
These tablets will help you with the pain and the inflammation in your ankle, but you will have to take them.
If this medication were more critical, your negligence could have been lethal.
- l don't want to go to High Trees.
- You're already here.
I don't drink at night.
If you wet the bed, they send you to High Trees..
- (Danny) lt's all right.
- (Mrs Steel) I have not wet the bed!
(Danny) Of course you haven't wet the bed, Mum.
Shh.
Have you at least seen her drink?
- Have you seen her drink anything at all?
- Not as such.
I drink in the morning, as I always do.
Shh.
D'you have any rehydration salts?
I don't know.
A diarrhoea preparation'll do.
I think your mother's been avoiding fluids at night for some time.
- What?
- She's not drinking.
She's worried about wetting the bed.
Surely she must be drinking something?
Mm. in the mornings.
Joan would take her a cup of tea or two.
That would raise her fluids, temporarily.
Make her lucid.
- l found some.
- Oh, thank you.
- She might not be demented at all?
- Well, let's wait and see.
Mrs Steel, I need to see you drink this.
- No.
- Come on.
Come on!
Come on, Mum, it'll help you.
All right, we need to get a drip into her.
Don't worry. you'll feel much better very soon.
- Praise the Lord.
- Hmm?
Good dog. (Mutters unintelligibly)
- Don't do that.
- What?
That.
With that animal.
This is a doctor's surgery.
- Get it out of here.
- You're not an animal, are you?
What's your name, eh?
- What's his name?
- lt's not my dog.
Have you wormed him?
- No.
- What about flea and tick?
I can do that.
- No.
- Takes 2 minutes.
- Get out!
Get, get out!
- (Barks)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ah, Mr Rix.
Mrs Rix.
Follow me.
You've suffered a number of contusions and fractures over the last couple of years.
- Well, not that many.
- l've counted seventeen.
Ah.
Did you have a problem with balance?
Vision?
Hearing?
No.
Don't hear me when I tell him to take the bin out.
- Are you on any medication?
- None.
- Are you a drug user?
- No!
And the burns you went to the hospital with?
- Bonfire.
- Cooking.
- Petrol.
- Hot fat.
- Cooking on a bonfire?
- Barbecue.
Have you always been accident prone?
- No.
- Yeah.
There's a strong possibility you have one of a number of serious conditions which would explain why you keep injuring yourself.
I've spoken to a colleague at the hospital in Truro and arranged for you to jump several queues.
You'll have an ultrasound of your carotid arteries to see whether you've had transient ischaemic attacks, which cause blackouts.
You'll have an EEG to record your brainwave activity, which would rule out epilepsy.
Or not.
But most importantly, you'll have an mri scan which will show us whether you have a primary or a secondary brain tumour.
Well, maybe it's for the best.
Don't be stupid.
Yeah.
She's right, Doc.
There's no need to go to all that fuss.
You don't seem to understand.
If you have a brain tumour, and you do nothing, you may well die.
It's nice of you to go to all this trouble.
Look, have some of my smoked mackerel pâté.
We smoke the mackerel ourselves.
Honest, we understand and we'll think about everything you said, and, um, we'll be in touch.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
- All right, Doc?
- Oh, Mark.
How's your wrist?
Fine.
Everyone's making a fuss of me, which is unnecessary.
All in the line of duty.
Look, I was touched by that.
But you didn't actually confront a mugger, did you?
- Technically, no, that's right.
- Well, not technically, actually.
That's only one way of looking at it.
I didn't know Al wasn't the mugger, did I?
So I did confront him, didn't I?
The public likes to think the police are making progress on sensitive issues.
- Makes them feel safe.
- That's better than knowing the truth?
I don't think folk wanna hear our friend hasn't even been sighted.
- Truth is, there is no mugger.
- How's that?
I can't tell you how I know that.
Patient confidentiality.
But I do know that.
So...
I sprained my wrist for nothing?
- Mm.
- But everybody signed my card.
Lucy Holmes.
There's Rick, Bert and Al.
Lou and Dan - that's a blast from the past, those two.
There's young Peter Cronk... lt's embarrassing now.
- Lou and Dan?
is that...
- Yeah.
Louisa and Danny.
He used to bring out the old green-eyed monster in me.
You know, when I thought Louisa was "the one".
Right.
Martin!
Marty.
Oh, Mu is back to her old self.
- Pretty annoying, then.
Mm.
- Vile.
- Good.
- Good?
She's fighting fit.
- l'm very proud of you.
- l'll drop in and see her tomorrow.
No, we're going to fetch her.
At three o'clock.
Yeah, I can't remember the last time I had a conversation with her like today.
It's like she's back from the beyond.
So, thank you.
D'you know Lou?
Lou Glasson?
- (Lou) Yeah.
- Yes.
You forget everyone knows everyone.
- Martin.
- Lou (!
).
We're going for a drink.
Celebrate.
Well, enjoy your evening.
Bless you.
I didn't sneeze.
- (Al) And what did she tell you yesterday?
- (Paul) Oh, I don't know.
Nothing.
(Al) She was on the phone.
She said, "He's too shy."
He always waits for the girl to make the move.
He's always waiting for permission.
And when you give him permission, he messes up.
She said it's...it's pathetic.
Yeah, well, I suppose I can see why she went back to her old boyfriend.
- Morning, Doc.
- All right, Doc?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- (Al) What did she tell you yesterday?
- (Paul) Oh, I don't know.
Nothing.
Thanks for telling me that, Pauline.
She was pretty blunt.
Yeah, well, you know Elaine.
Right.
She said you had a nice bum.
- Al?
- Yeah?
She was right.
Thanks.
(Phone rings)
Portwenn Surgery.
(Knock on door)
Doc?
- Phone call.
- Oh.
Er...
Pauline.
I gather your cousin's not coming back.
Erm, no.
Right, well l...
I wanna be clear, I'm going to advertise her job.
Yeah, good. 'Cause I was gonna say, you know, I can't cover forever.
Oh.
Yeah.
This phone call. lt's urgent. lt's Mrs Rix.
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
We're so sorry to have troubled you.
Another accident.
Now do you see the need for proper investigation?
He's upstairs.
Could you switch a light on or open the curtains?
Oh, dear.
We'd, er, appreciate your discretion, doctor.
What have you done to him?
Well, I was hoisting him up and something gave.
Don't say anything, Doc.
The boys down at the harbour, I...
I'd never live it down.
- ls this consenting?
- Uh?
Consenting?
He loves it.
- My shoulder!
- Ah, yes.
Sorry.
Er, which one?
- Right.
- OK.
Can you move it?
No.
- This hurt?
- Ow!
Ooooooh.
It's your trapezius muscle. I'll give you an injection of diazepam.
- ls it all the injuries?
- Yeah.
- And the burns as well?
- Mm.
Oh, apart from down on the harbour.
- That was just a fall.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- l'm sorry, Doc.
- Well, you...you've gotta be more careful.
Well, it's just sometimes, in the heat of the moment,
Eddie forgets his safe word.
- Don't tell him that!
- Oh, it's all right, sausage, he's a doctor.
- Well, I should explain...
- No, you don't have to.
Well, we've been married a long time, you see, and...when our boys left home, we needed a bit of spark.
So, you...you don't like injections, do you?
- No.
- Good.
Ow!
And then, by chance, we found this.
Opened up a whole new world. (Titters)
Now there's a spark.
Oh, Marty.
Oh, you look much better.
- You must think you're the bee's knees.
- No, I don't.
Can I see your ankle?
Oh, the swelling's gone down considerably.
Good.
Prescribe a glass of water, and suddenly you're the cat's whiskers.
- Can I ask you some questions?
- What for?
Just routine.
Er, if I had £100 and spent seven, how much would I have left?
It's Wednesday. lt's 3.15 in the afternoon.
Labour is in its third term of power and still hasn't done anything for the elderly.
We are in High Trees, home for old codgers, near Portwenn, and you would have £93 left, which these days, little Marty, wouldn't get you much.
Right.
Right.
Ready then?
I'll put your suitcase in the car.
Yes.
Unless...
What?
Unless you could see about me staying on.
Yes, I know. I was terrified of coming here, and, well, look at it.
I can't think why I was scared.
And, er...more to the point, I didn't know what I was missing.
- Well, I...
I could ask.
- Then ask.
- You're sure?
- No.
There's a lot of flatulence about, and if it gets too bad, I can change my mind.
But, in the meantime, yes. I think I am sure.
Well, I'll...talk to the manager.
Well...
Well, what am I going to do at half past eight every morning?
You've got a farm to run.
Muriel?
Do you want a go?
- (Joan) Good God.
- Please don't take his name in vain.
Oh, Marty.
I know why she was terrified of coming here.
Why?
Well, because I was so ridiculously frightened for her.
is that because you're getting old, too?
Well, I wouldn't have put it quite so bluntly.
Mm.
- Right, d'you want a lift?
- No.
No, I'm fine on my own.
All right.
- Sorry.
No.
Erm...
- l'm terribly sorry.
- Right.
- Thanks.
- Expensive wine.
- Yes. I...
I fancied it.
I fancy an old friend...
I mean, I'm having an old friend over for dinner tonight so, er...
- Louisa...
- Come on, you.
Doc.
Danny.
- l could eat a horse.
Come on.
- OK.
- Right. 'Night.
- 'Night, then.
english HOH
I listen to a boring song as I stare out the window
Let me don a dress and dance for you
Am I insane?
Please tell me
Someday, the wind will take me away
And now we can't remember it
Why don't I have wings to float in the sky, like the wind, like the clouds?
Why don't I have wings to sink into the all-enveloping night, like the stars, like the moon?
Ahh
Hurry...
Do it quickly, Esther!
With a thirst this bad...
I will most likely wind up sucking all your blood...
So kill me...
Kill me, before I kill you...
No...
I can't!
Do it, Esther...
I cannot hold it back any more...
I beg you!
I... do not want to hurt you...
Please!
Your Lordship...
It's all right.
You can suck my blood.
So please stop crying.
It isn't your fault.
You aren't to blame.
Esther...
Now, then...
Esther...
I...
I...
N-no!
I can't!
Thank you, Esther...
I will never forget your kindness...
Your Lordship!
Stay away!
I'm glad I met you...
Goodbye, Esther!
Stop!
Looks like I made it just in time...
Sorry about that!
I sort of wasted some time getting here!
Father Nightroad!
Süleyman!
Impossible!
The palace is supposed to be fully secured!
What is it, Duchess of Kiev?
I've come to expose your acts of treason!
You're going to expose me?
The Count of Memphis and the Terran with him are my witnesses!
With their accounts of the situation and collateral evidence-
Unfortunately, that is impossible!
I was told just moments ago that they were found dead inside their cell.
What?
!
It seems they killed each other.
If you don't believe me, you're free to inspect their bodies for yourself.
Interesting!
Then go ahead and inspect me!
Count!
I'm quite alive, as you can see!
And I know all about your secret plot!
Your murders of my grandmother and Her Majesty are clear as day!
Give yourself up quietly!
You should give yourself up, Count!
You repugnant traitor!
Halt!
Impossible!
How?
!
How is she still alive?
!
How?
!
You almost seem troubled that I am alive, Duke of Tigris...
W-whatever do you mean?
Why would I ever blow Your Majesty up?
I am not referring to the Moldova mausoleum incident.
After all, I was never there.
Show him your face.
The Duchess of Moldova?
!
Indeed.
The Duchess of Moldova and head of the Imperial Privy Council,
Mirka Fortuna.
Grandmother?
Why?
!
Why is Grandmother-
I knew the traitors would spring into action upon your return.
I made the Duchess of Moldova serve as my body double and placed an automaton in the manor.
Süleyman.
Never did I expect you to be the chief behind this machination...
Out of all my children, I had especially high hopes for you...
P-please wait, Your Majesty!
Why do you listen only to them?
!
I would never wish death upon you, Your Majesty!
Tell me...
Do you recognize this face?
You're-!
Even my blood froze when I had the Ring of Solomon pointed at me.
This... can't be!
Isn't that- Seth-chan?
!
Do you have anything else to say?
I do...
You said that you had high hopes for me, Your Majesty...
Indeed.
I feel deep regret.
Regret?
What hollow words.
No one has high hopes for you!
There's not a single person among us who trusts in you!
Süleyman!
Why... did you miss?
I am a child with no love...
for his mother...
Süleyman...
After 300 years of servitude...
I find you are someone I cannot comprehend...
Who... are you?
Who are we?
How I wish I could answer that...
Well done, everyone.
I thank you.
Yes, Your Majesty!
Yes, Your Majesty!
And, Esther...
Yes, Seth-chanI mean, Your Majesty?
!
Seth is fine.
You're not a vassal.
You're my friend.
Okay, Seth-chan!
What were you going to ask?
Where is the other envoy who came with you?
Father Nightroad ran off the instant we mentioned the Baron of Luxor.
The Baron of Luxor?
No, the baron had already passed away.
The one controlling him now is a man named Dietrich, of the Orden...
The Orden?
!
Here we go, self-restoration!
Step away from there!
So you did come...
That thing will do nothing but bring forth disaster!
But your people used it long ago...
Don't worry, I'm not blaming you or anything.
If you'll overlook this, I will simply leave for today.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Leave the data cube and come here!
You're surprisingly sharp-sighted...
But I'd rather die than take orders from someone!
It's no use!
What do you think?
Neat, huh?
I decided to give my blood combustive abilities, too!
Now what?
Nano-machines, Crusnik 02!
80%-
What?
!
The Crusnik-
I see...
A vampire that sucks the blood of vampires...
Yet, you don't want to feed.
Is this the result of acting stoic?
H-how do you-
How do I know about that?
I've heard many other things, as well.
That you were once the enemy of the world, for instance.
Goodbye, Father.
Think you could stop right there?
Who are you?
Me?
I'm just a pretty girl who's passing by.
S-Seth...
It's been a long time, Abel.
How have you been?
Sorry, but could you please not interrupt?
!
You're-
W-what is this?
!
The power of Crusnik 03!
High-energy focused ultrasonic waves!
Flames of Sound!
I will spare you today.
But you will pay next time!
I will have my revenge for your irreparable sins against my children!
You will know the wrath of my vengeance
Seth...
It's been 900 years, Abel-niisan.
Thank you for everything!
Please be safe on your return home!
Right!
Your Lordship.
Take care...
Y-yes.
You too...
Right!
Well then, everyone.
Please take care!
If you have something to say, you should say it.
She will grow old and die before you realize it.
There is no guarantee you'll ever see her again.
But what do I say?
!
Just say what you feel.
Or am I wrong about your feelings?
Esther!
Your Lordship!
Let's promise to see each other again sometime...
Yes, Your Lordship...
Say.
Why don't you stay here?
We can live like siblings again!
I'm a sinner.
It's been 900 years!
Surely she would-
I cannot be forgiven!
I absolutely cannot forgive myself.
Well, whatever.
Having you there is more convenient, anyway.
Convenient?
He's still alive.
We were careless.
After having fused 100% with the Crusnik nano-machines, being dropped through the atmosphere was nothing to him!
They...
Brother?
!
I will destroy him.
I swear it!
I know this will not remain forever
However, it's beautiful
Your eyes, hands, and your warm smile
They're my treasure
It's hard to forget
I wish there was a solution
Don't spend your time in confusion
I'll turn back now and spread
My broken wings still strong enough to cross the ocean with
My broken wing show far should I go drifting in the wind
Higher and higher in the light (My broken wings)
Still strong enough to cross the ocean with
My broken wing show far should I go drifting in the wind
Across the sky, just keep on flying
(What's falling from the sky is not rain... )
Next time"Episode 20:
The Throne of Roses I. Kingdom of the North"
Let thine eyes be not diverted.
=DS= 2006
CHOP 'EM TO THE LEFT!
CHOP 'EM TO THE RIGHT!
CHOP 'EM EVERY CHANCE YOU GET!
FRIGHT, FRIGHT, FRIGHT!
ALL RIGHT, CREEPS.
IT'S FOURTH AND GHOUL.
THEY'RE PROBABLY EXPECTING US TO RUN A GHOST PATTERN,
SO LET'S RUN A SCREAM PASS INSTEAD!
OF COURSE, I COULD PULL OUT A FEW OTHER SURPRISES
FROM MY PLAYBOOK, LIKE TONIGHT'S TALE.
IT'S ABOUT A COUPLE OF BROTHERS
WHO ARE PLANNING A LITTLE HIGH SCARING OF THEIR OWN
IN A NASTY BIT OF OFFENSE I CALL
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN BRASS HEARSES.
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN BRASS HEARSES
CLEAN UP AROUND HERE.
AW, HELL.
WHO DRANK ALL THE HAWAIIAN PUNCH?
I DON'T KNOW.
SHIT.
BUTTER?
NO, THANKS.
HEY, BILLY?
DO YOU THINK THAT FRANK AND JESSE JAMES
EVER PLANNED A WAREHOUSE ROBBERY?
MAYBE.
AN ICE CREAM WAREHOUSE, BILLY, YOU THINK, MAYBE?
NO, NOT AN ICE CREAM WAREHOUSE,
LITTLE BROTHER.
WE'RE STILL A LOT LIKE
FRANK AND JESSE JAMES, AIN'T WE, BILLY?
YEAH, KINDA.
NOW, SHUT UP.
I'M WATCHING THIS.
OF COURSE, FRANK AND JESSE JAMES RODE HORSES
AND WE DRIVE AROUND IN AN IMPALA.
BUT AN IMPALA IS A KIND OF HORSE,
RIGHT, BILLY?
AIN'T IT?
ARGH!
ENOUGH OF THIS JESSE JAMES SHIT!
FORGET ABOUT HIM!
HE'S A WUSSY!
DID HE EVER DO 2 YEARS
AT SAN QUENTIN LIKE I DID, DID HE?
NO, BILLY.
OH.
OH, SHIT, VIRG...
YOU KNOW--YOU KNOW I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
RIGHT?
HEY, COME ON.
COME ON, NOW.
WHO'S YOUR BIG BROTHER, HUH?
HUH?
WHO'S ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR YOU, HUH?
YOU ARE, BILLY.
YOU'RE THE BEST.
HEE HEE HEE!
GODDAMN RIGHT, I AM!
NOW, COME ON, WHAT'S WITH ALL THE QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE GIG TOMORROW?
YOU GETTING NERVOUS?
NO, BILLY, I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
WELL, GOOD, 'CAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD
ANY FUCK-UPS, NOW, CAN WE?
SURE CAN'T.
THAT'D BE TROUBLE.
THAT'D BE BIG TROUBLE.
YEAH, BIG TROUBLE.
SO LET'S GO OVER IT ONE MORE TIME.
WHO'S ON YOUR SHIFT?
TOM AND COOTER.
ALL RIGHT.
AND WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU'RE GONNA DO
WHEN YOU GET IN THERE?
TELL OL' TOM TO GO PICK UP A TRANSFER
OVER AT 41 RIGHT AWAY.
AND IF HE GIVES YOU ANY GRIEF?
TELL HIM THAT THE CALL CAME DOWN
FROM THE DISTRICT CENTER.
AND THEN I'LL WAIT FOR COOTER TO GO ON HIS BREAK,
AND THEN-- AND THEN, UM...
I UNLOCK THE DOOR, AND--
NO!
GOD--
DISENGAGE THE FIRE ALARM,
THEN YOU UNLOCK THE DOOR!
YOU GOT IT?
RIGHT.
PLEASE, TELL ME YOU GOT IT.
RIGHT.
RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.
I'LL REMEMBER, BILLY.
I PROMISE.
I PROMISE.
GOOD.
LET'S HOPE SO.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
ENOUGH OF THAT.
NOW, GET YOUR SHIRT ON.
THERE'S ONE THING I WANT TO DO
BEFORE THE SHIT HITS THE FAN TOMORROW.
WHAT'S THAT, BILLY?
EAT A LITTLE ICE CREAM.
SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE,
NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN AWAY.
WE MEET AGAIN, MR. BYRD.
PATIENCE, MY LITTLE FRIENDS!
PATIENCE!
REMEMBER, THERE'S A METHOD TO MY MADNESS!
OK!
TA-DA!
HEY, MR. BYRD, IT LOOKS LIKE
ALL OUR FRIENDS WANT ICE CREAM!
OF COURSE THEY DO, LITTLE WILLY.
BUT WHAT SHOULD WE DO FIRST?
BITE THE BIG ONE!
OH!
WELL, IF IT'S THE BIG ONE DANNY WANTS,
MR. BYRD, I'D RECOMMEND ONE OF MY DELICIOUS
FROSTY FREEZE FRUIT DRINKS!
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, LITTLE WILLY.
THEY COME IN EIGHT EXCITING FLAVORS.
AND THEY'RE GOOD FOR YOU, TOO.
IN FACT, I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE ONE
RIGHT NOW.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL THE BOYS AND GIRLS
A LITTLE KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE WHILE I ENJOY
THIS FABULOUS NEW 79-CENT DRINK SENSATION.
OK, BOYS AND GIRLS!
WHO WANTS TO HEAR A KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE?
I DO!
ALL RIGHT.
KNOCK-KNOCK.
WHO'S THERE?
I SAID WHO'S THERE?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, BYRD?
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ONE OF YOUR OLD
VENDOR BUDDIES?
I USED TO DRIVE A RIG JUST LIKE THIS.
'COURSE, I LOOK A LITTLE WORSE FOR WEAR.
SEEING HOW I JUST SPENT
THE LAST TWO YEARS OF MY LIFE
ROTTING IN PRISON.
BUT YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THAT.
YOU PUT ME THERE.
I REMEMBER, WILLIAM.
YOU WERE TRIMMING YOUR PROFITS,
SELLING YOUR INVENTORY ON THE SIDE.
YOU WERE STEALING.
HURRY IT UP, BUTTHEAD.
I WAS JUST KIDDIN'.
HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, KIDS.
I GOT WHAT I DESERVED.
HEY, AND TO SHOW YOU WHAT A SPORT I AM,
I'LL EVEN TAKE SOMETHING TO GO.
LET'S SEE...
YOU GOT ANYTHING IN...
BUTTER NUT?
NOPE.
BUTTER BRICKLE?
NOPE.
BUTTERMILK?
NOPE.
I DO HAVE BUTTERSCOTCH.
FINE.
MAKE IT TWO.
CAN YOU BREAK THIS?
CERTAINLY.
I DO HOPE YOU DON'T HARBOR
ANY HARD FEELINGS, WILLIAM.
I MEAN...
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.
GEE.
YOU'RE A SMART MAN, BYRD.
I ONLY WISH I'D HAVE COME
AND TALKED TO YOU SOONER.
HEY, KID.
EAT UP.
WHAT IS IT?
BUTTER
LOSER.
I DO!
I DO!
SURPRISE.
HEY!
THANKS.
YOU'LL GET YOURS TOMORROW, BYRD.
BILLY, HE'S JUST AN OLD PUPPET MAN.
I DON'T CARE IF HE CAN PULL MONKEYS
OUT OF HIS ASS WITH A HAIRPIN.
I WANT PAYBACK!
OH, SURE, BILLY.
ANYTHING YOU SAY.
I MEAN, YOU DONE HARD TIME.
DAMN.
AW, HERE.
HELL, HAVE MINE.
GO ON, TAKE IT.
I LOST MY TASTE FOR THE STUFF.
LOADING DOCK 4,
THAT'S LESS THAN ONE HOUR.
Quality Taste Ice Cream Co.
TRUCK LOADING ONLY
MR. VIRGIL!
VIRGIL!
VIRGIL?
COOTER!
DAMN IT, WHERE ARE THEM 2 MONKEYS ANYWAY--
OW!
OH, GOD,
WIPE THAT SMILE OFF YOUR FACE.
GO ON, BOTH OF YOU.
WHERE WERE YOU?
WORKING!
GOOFING OFF IS MORE LIKE IT.
I WAS ON MY BREAK!
LISTEN, MISTER--
THIS IS NOT A PLAYPEN FOR BOYS IN SHORT PANTS.
I AIN'T WEARIN' SHORT PANTS.
CAN IT.
NOW, "B" OLD BYRD JUST PULLED IN.
AND WHERE--WHERE IS LITTLE TOM, HUH, HUH?
HE SAID THAT HE HAD TO GO OVER TO 41
AND PICK UP A STOCK TRANSFER.
WHAT?
AND WHO AUTHORIZED THAT?
DISTRICT SUPER.
OH, GODDAMN IT!
DAMN HIM.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KEEP THINGS
RUNNING SMOOTHLY AROUND HERE
WHEN ALL I'M LEFT WITH IS YOU TWO,
YOU--YOU KNUCKLEHEADS.
HE SHOULD KNOW THAT MR. BYRD
IS NOT A MAN WHO LIKES TO BE KEPT WAITING.
BEEN THAT WAY FOR 15 YEARS.
WHEN MR. BYRD HAS A SCHEDULED PICK-UP
HE ARRIVES ON TIME,
AND HE EXPECTS THE SAME COURTESY IN RETURN.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CALL
GOOD OLD-FASHIONED VALUES.
YOU KNOW, YOU BOYS COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO
FROM MR. BYRD.
GOD.
OH, I THINK WE KNOW ALL WE NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT MR. BYRD.
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, BOYS AND GIRLS?
HELL'S BELLS, BILLY!
IS THAT YOU?
COOTER, HOW YOU BEEN?
GOOD DAY, MISS GRAFUNGAR.
AND GOOD DAY TO YOU, MR. BYRD.
I'LL HAVE YOUR ORDER READY IN A JIFFY, BUT BEAR WITH ME.
I'M A MAN SHORT TODAY.
OH, OH, NO PROBLEM.
SO, MR. BYRD.
ARE WE GONNA HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF SEEING YOU AT THE VENDOR AWARDS THIS YEAR?
OH, UH...
THIS YEAR...
OH, I'M AFRAID NOT, MISS GRAFUNGAR.
WELL, IT SURE WOULD BE A WELCOME CHANGE TO SEE YOU THERE IN PERSON.
IT'S FUNNY, BUT, AHEM,
I JUST PURCHASED A LAVENDER PANTS SUIT.
AND IT WOULD LOOK MIGHTY SNAZZY
NEXT TO A FINE GENTLEMAN LIKE YOURSELF.
I'M SORRY, MISS GRAFUNGAR,
BUT I'M NOT MUCH FOR SUCH FRIVOLOUS FUNCTIONS.
OH, ME NEITHER.
LET'S SAY WE JUST BLOW IT OFF
AND HAVE A NICE, QUIET DINNER ALONE TOGETHER.
OH, YOU KNOW, I MAKE THE BEST POTATO CHIP AND GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE
YOU EVER TASTED--
UH, AH, I'M SORRY--I'M SORRY.
FINE.
I'M NOT UPSETTING YOU, AM I?
I SAID FINE!
THAT'LL BE $156.
156?
YES, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
AND HERE WE GO.
NOW YOU GET IT?
NOW YOU SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
WE GET HIM IN HERE WHEN NOBODY'S GONNA SEE US,
AND THEN WE DO THE DIRTY DEED.
IT'S AN EXTRA 500 IN CASH, EASY.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BREAK COOTER'S NOSE, BILLY.
VIRGIL, THE GUY'S AN IDIOT.
FORGET ABOUT HIM--
NOM HE'S NOT.
HE'S SMART, BILLY.
HE REALLY IS.
LIKE ONE TIME HE ASKED ME WHO'D WIN IN A FIGHT,
DARTH VADER, ROBOCOP OR THE MUNSTERS,
AND I THOUGHT DARTH VADER WOULD WIN,
BUT COOTER, HE'D DONE LIKE A WHOLE BUNCH OF RESEARCH--
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
!
FUCK, YOU'RE AS STUPID AS HE IS!
OH, SHIT.
VIRGIL!
VIRGIL, COME ON.
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.
ALL RIGHT, WHEN GRAFUNGAR WALKS BACK TO HER OFFICE,
BYRD'S IN THERE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
OH, SHIT!
VIRGIL!
YOU'RE GONNA WAIT TILL SHE POPS THAT SAFE OPEN,
THEN YOU'RE GONNA STEP IN BEHIND HER, RIGHT?
RIGHT?
THEN YOU'RE GONNA KEEP HER THERE
NICE AND QUITE WHILE I TAKE CARE OF BYRD, YOU GOT IT?
VIRGIL, PLEASE, WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW!
I NEED YOU ON THIS ONE!
NO, YOU DON'T.
COME ON, YES, I DO!
NO, YOU DON'T, YOU DON'T-- WE'RE A TEAM!
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE ME.
YEAH, I DO LIKE YOU!
YOU'RE ALWAYS YELLING AT ME,
AND YOU'RE HITTING ME AND STUFF--
NO, YOU'VE GOT THAT ALL WRONG, BABY BROTHER.
DON'T YOU GET IT?
DON'T YOU SEE?
IT'S NOT ME.
IT'S THEM!
WHO?

EVERYBODY OUT THERE SAYING THE DeLUCA BROTHERS ARE SHIT.
SCREW 'EM!
THEY'RE GARBAGE!
THEY'RE SCUM!
WHO'S SAYING THAT?
EVERYBODY, VIRGIL.

VIRGIL!
I'M RUNNING A BIT LATE.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

LAZY JERK, CAN'T EVEN LOAD HIS OWN TRUCK.
WHY SHOULD THAT CHANGE?
BEEN THAT WAY FOR 15 YEARS!
VIRGIL!
I HATE HER.
SO DO I, BRO.
BUT WE'RE OUTNUMBERED.
YOU AND ME IS ALL EACH OTHER'S GOT.
I'M GONNA HURT HER, BILLY.
I'M GONNA HURT HER FOR YOU.
THAT'LL SHOW 'EM.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU JUST FOLLOW THE PLAN.
YEAH, BUT I WANT TO.
I WANNA HURT HER, BILLY.
OK, DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO,
GIVE HER A TITTY-TWISTER, TOO.
BUT USE YOUR HEAD.

OK, SURE.

VIR-R-R-R-GIL!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, GO, GO!
VIR-R-R-R-GIL!
VIRGIL!
WELL, THERE YOU ARE.
STUMBLING AROUND LIKE YOU HAVEN'T GOT
A BRAIN IN YOUR HEAD.

HURRY UP!
THAT JERK'S GOT A STICK UP HIS ASS
ABOUT PROMPT ATTENTION.
SON OF A BITCH.
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF KNOCKING?
OH, WIPE THAT STUPID SMILE OFF YOUR FACE.
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY, HUH?
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED
FOR FALLS LESS THAN THAT!
BILLY SAYS I GOTTA KEEP YOU HERE.
YEAH, WHAT'S HE GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING?
STUPID IDIOT.
HOPE YOUR SLIME-BALL BROTHER ROTS IN PRISON.
LET'S HAVE SOME SERVICE OUT HERE!
HOP TO IT, PEOPLE!
MISS GRAFUNGAR!
COME ON.
GET OUT OF THE TRUCK.

WHERE'S GRAFUNGAR?
BILLY, I DID LIKE YOU SAID.
MISS GRAFUNGAR!

BILLY...

I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY, BILLY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
MISS GRAFUNGAR!

LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE.
COME ON, LET'S GET THAT SAFE!
MOVE IT!

NO.
OH, NO!
SHE CLOSED THE SAFE!
PLEASE TELL ME YOU TOOK THE MONEY OUT.
NO, I DIDN'T TAKE IT OUT, BILLY.
YOU SAID YOU'D DO IT, THAT'S THE PLAN.
FREAKING MURDER ONE AND WE DIDN'T GET SHIT.
BILLY, WHAT ABOUT THE PUPPET MAN?
HE STILL GOT MONEY, DON'T HE?
YOU SAID HE HAD 500 BUCKS, EASY.
YEAH.
THE PUPPET MAN.
SHH, SHUT UP!
I WASN'T TALKING.
HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE 'EM, BYRD.
WE WANT IT ALL,
AND WE DON'T MEAN 31 FLAVORS.
YEAH!
NO, NO.
PLEASE.
SPARE ME.
IT WASN'T MY IDEA TO REPORT YOU.
I TRIED TO TALK 'EM--
FREEZE!
ENOUGH OF THIS CRAZY SHIT.
SHOW 'EM, VIRG.
SHOW 'EM WE GOT WAYS OF MAKING HIM TALK.
RIGHT, BILLY.
YOU FUCKIN' IDIOT.
OH...

HEE HEE!

HUH?

IT AIN'T OVER YET.
IT'S PAYBACK TIME!

YES, YES.
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?
I BET YOU AND YOUR BROTHER WERE REAL CLOSE.
FUCK YOU!
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY BROTHER,
WE WERE CLOSE, TOO...
TILL HE DIED.
IN FACT, WE'RE STILL CLOSE.
LOOK HOW CLOSE.
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!
GOD, NO!
BROTHERHOOD'S KINDA LIKE A BOND, ISN'T IT?
THE KIND THAT YOU CAN'T EASILY WALK AWAY FROM.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
BROTHER EARL...
HE WASN'T QUITE A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY.
BUT WHEN HE WAS DOING LITTLE WILLY'S VOICE,
HE WAS ONE HELL OF AN ICE CREAM SALESMAN!
HEH HEH HEH.
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS HIM.
GO TO HELL, YOU FREAK!
YOU'RE FIRST.
1/2 PRICE ICE CREAM
YO, BYRD.
YOUR ICE CREAM SUCKS!
HEY, KID, BLOW ME.
AND YOU SMELL, TOO.
YOU HEAR THAT, EARL?
THE KID SAYS WE SUCK!
YEAH, RIGHT, YEAH, RIGHT, YEAH, RIGHT.
AND WE SMELL.
GO FIGURE.
SHAME ABOUT BILLY AND VIRGIL.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, KIDDIES-- 2 DEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE!
AND AS FOR BYRD, HE STAYED IN THE ICE CREAM BUSINESS,
AND DID VERY WELL.
EVERYONE LOVES BEN AND SCARY'S.
WELL, I GOTTA GET BACK TO MY PRACTICE.
NEXT WEEK, WE'RE PLAYING THE WASHINGTON DREADSKINS.
45... 22... 33...
HUT!
HUT!
HUT!
YOU IDIOT!
I DIDN'T CALL FOR A "HAND-OFF."
They say that starting a family is an act of optimism.
Well, Tom and I were clearly very, very, very optimistic.
There are always good times and difficult ones along the way.
And with 12 kids, you learn a lot of lessons.
But the one that you never get used to is that moment when you look your child in the eye and find yourself having to say the most difficult word of all:
Goodbye.
All right, stay together.
There she is.
Sergio Archer.
Look, she's right there.
Robert Armstrong.
Peter Bailey.
Lorraine Baker.
- He's really gotten good.
- Yeah.
My gosh.
Kicking, kicking.
All right, all right.
It is time to toast the graduate.
Lorraine, we are all so proud of you, for keeping your chin up and charging the mountain.
And for being a truly unique and wonderful person.
And for getting that internship at Allure magazine.
Did you know about that?
Even though I'll be trying to convince you staying here is a better choice for your future!
than moving to dirty, expensive, crime-ridden New York City, but here's to Lorraine.
OK.
My daughter Nora and her husband Bud, you wanna say something?
And our future linebacker.
We go.
Let's go.
First of all, congratulations, Lorraine.
Bud and I hope that our baby will be as cool and accomplished as you.
And second of all, I don't mean to make this toast all about Bud and I,
- but we have some kind of big news.
- You know about this?
I've just been offered the vice-presidency of a new advertising firm.
Hey!
Congratulations.
Yeah!
In Houston.
We're moving in September.
Thank you.
Great.
Wow.
- Does this mean we won't be uncles?
- You'll be uncles no matter where we live.
Maybe they thought it was the best way to break it to us.
- Quite a surprise.
- I'll say.
Can I get a beer and a white wine?
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.
- I feel like I'm losing two daughters now.
- You're not losing us.
I hope you have help, 'cause with no family there and you being a first-time mom...
- You'll be at work all day...
- I'm not gonna be at work all the time.
We're gonna be fine.
And whatever house we get is gonna have a room reserved for you.
At least you're gonna stay for the touch football game.
- We can't.
We have Lamaze.
- This will help your breathing.
We're gonna see you soon.
You're driving, right?
- See you.
- Bye, sweetheart.
There you go, sir.
That's...
They seem so casual and cavalier.
Well, time for me to get my hands dirty.
You're working?
What about the game?
Rematch against the cousins.
I've got student loans to pay off, Dad.
- OK.
See you.
- Be safe, honey.
Did everybody forget touch football was a tradition here?
- Honey, you've got ten other kids to draft.
- I forgot.
- You forgot?
- Lorraine.
- Staying for the game?
- No, didn't Mom tell you?
I'm spending the weekend at Beth's.
I leave in five minutes.
Love you.
Bye.
Hey, guys.
Ready for some touch?
- Mike and I are competing at the skate park.
- I volunteered at the animal shelter.
Nigel, Kyle, football.
All right.
- I'm here, Coach.
- You just made the varsity, little lady.
Come on.
There you go.
Go, go, go!
- I'll block for you.
Here we go.
Go!
- Athletes!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Somehow I thought it'd get easier.
Ten minutes ago, they were all over us.
Now they don't want to be seen with us in public.
- What's that doing here?
- I bet Lorraine was looking through this.
That's sweet.
The cutest.
Look at her.
She looks just like my mom.
A lot of memories.
Summers in Wisconsin.
Swimming.
All of us camping out.
Everyone together.
Isn't that sweet?
That had to be the last time we were there.
What was it?
Three or four years ago?
- Look at Sarah.
No teeth.
- We were one tight unit back then.
Even if we never beat the Murtaughs for the Labor Day Cup.
Look at that.
Jimmy Murtaugh
- Mr Competitive.
He was so desperate to win, he would... he would win.
All the time.
Even when we were kids, this guy was...
All right, honey.
Let's not go there.
You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.
Go back to the lake.
The whole family on vacation, like we used to.
I could call Mike Romanow and see if the house is available.
It's a great idea, but the kids are in summer school and Nora's pregnant.
That's exactly why we should do it, Kate.
We said it.
Life's blazing by.
Let's go back to the lake one last time.
We did have such good times there, honey.
You and I had alone time, which was nice.
There's the proof.
- Hey, Gunner.
- Hey, Gunner.
Let's call Mike Romanow, honey.
You're conferencing with all of us and Lorraine.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
- It's Lorraine.
- We have a surprise.
We rented the big house up in Lake Winnetka.
- Winnetka?
That's my middle name.
- And Lake is mine.
And it's where we're gonna spend Labor Day, just like in the old days.
Dad, I'm gonna be very pregnant then.
And I'm gonna be apartment hunting in New York in August.
- I wanna hang out with my friends.
- How come we're named after a house?
Good question.
Your middle name is Winnetka and your middle name is Lake
- 'cause you were conceived there.
- What does "conceived" mean?
- It means Mom and Dad...
- Had a conversation that we'd discuss it later.
Kyle and me will go anyplace that has our name on it.
- Bingo!
Come on.
- Yeah.
I love the lake.
I'm in.
- I guess I can cancel a couple of gigs.
- Bingo!
- OK, we're in.
- All right.
We agree to participate.
We'll bring the wakeboards and totally dominate.
- OK, we're in.
- All right!
And that leaves Lorraine.
- Come on.
You'll have fun.
- Come on, Lorraine.
Just come.
All right, here's the deal.
I'll go to the lake if Dad stops nagging me about not going to New York.
Deal.
That's a dozen.
We're going to the lake.
- Who cut the cheese?
- Gunner farted.
We'll drive up tomorrow or the next day.
- You missed.
- I love you too.
Bye.
Lorraine's got a line on a place.
She and Charlie will come in a couple of days.
Couple of days?
The whole point of the vacation is that the whole family is together.
Honey, relax.
All right.
Remember this?
Look at the lake.
It looks fantastic.
- Does it look great or what?
- Come on, kids.
All right.
Slide out.
Hurry up.
Everyone out.
Come on.
Let's check the place out.
- Look at it.
- This is it?
- Remember this?
- It looks smaller.
- And more disgusting.
- Yeah.
Why can't we rent that place?
Well, that place is new.
- This place is...
- Older, but still nice.
Yeah.
And that might have a water slide, but our place has...
There's stairs.
They're fun.
So unload, camper dudes!
Girls in the north bunk room, boys in the south.
- Bud and Nora in the loft.
Come on!
- Careful.
Hey, Bud, give the phone a rest.
We're on vacation.
Hey.
How did Mad Dog like the trip?
Maybe the baby's not gonna be a "Mad Dog," Tom.
But that's a classic linebacker name.
OK, how about Dick Butkus McNulty?
- Maybe it's gonna be a girl, Dad.
- Donna Butkus McNulty.
- We got all vacation to pick a name.
- Someone's here.
- Mike Romanow.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Everything OK?
Shouldn't be too disorganized, only two renters this season.
- The lake's a lot more upscale.
- Thank Jimmy Murtaugh.
Remember him?
- Yeah.
- He owns most of the lake now.
That's his place over there.
Well, good for Jimmy.
- Hey, remember Kate?
- Hey, Mike.
How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
If you don't feel like cooking, there's a clambake up at the club.
- You can come as my guests.
- Guests?
Yeah.
Club's private now.
And renovated.
- Homeowners only.
Put you on the list?
- OK.
- What's going on?
- Stop!
The Chiseler.
- Tell me those aren't my keys.
- Get him outside, OK?
- I remember how to handle this guy.
- I can't believe he's still alive.
- You know that thing?
- Hey.
- Don't hurt him.
- I got it.
I got it.
It's a snap.
Here you go.
Hold still.
Yeah.
Leave him alone!
Gunner!
Stay!
Stay, Gunner!
- Get him.
- Gunner, stay!
Mom, watch out!
Don't light the fireworks.
- No explosives in the house!
- Nigel!
Kyle!
Gunner, come back.
- What was that beast?
- The Chiseler?
A pack rat.
Steals stuff and hides it.
- I'll get a trap in the morning.
- A humane trap, right?
You know what?
We got a fantastic first day going.
So let's clean up and unpack, 'cause we got a clambake to go to!
Clambake!
- OK, here we go.
What is all this stuff?
- I'm going as fast as I can.
I should put more sugar in your diets, get you moving.
You actually bought that shirt?
Every dad is entitled to one hideous shirt and one horrible sweater.
It's part of the dad code.
- Mark, you're on fireworks detail.
- OK.
- What's all that?
- Nothing.
Seatbelts.
OK, kids.
You know the rules.
I'm underdressed.
I thought this was supposed to be a clambake.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
- Hey, guys.
So glad you could come.
- Hi, Mike.
Good to see you.
Listen.
Kids, food's downstairs.
Mom, Dad, the bar is there.
Have a great time.
- Best behavior.
- Stick together.
Keep an eye on them.
- Food.
- See you later.
- Lloyd, how are you?
- Good to see you, Jimmy.
There's Jimmy Murtaugh!
Engage me in conversation.
- We are talking.
- I know, but more intense so he won't come.
- Just hide your face.
- Well, that's a little obvious.
- Tom!
- Turn.
My goodness.
Look what the wind blew in.
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
- Tom.
Look at you.
- How are you?
Wow, you're looking good.
A little wrinkled around the edges, but not bad for an old man.
- And you.
- Kate.
Kate.
Still looking very hot for a mother of 12.
- What brings you guys back to my lake?
- Your lake?
Your lake now?
Well, you know, I just have to buy Romanow's place and one or two other properties.
And then I can keep the riff-raff like you outta here.
I'm sorry, honey.
Tom and Kate, this is Sarina, my new bride.
- Nice to meet you, Sarina.
- Nice to meet you.
The parents of that family of pranksters I told you about.
Jimmy's always been jealous 'cause we have 12 kids and he has eight.
A manhood thing.
Well, your 12 never beat my eight for the cup, now, did they, Tom?
- Well, no, they didn't.
- Is that why you came back?
- Trying to knock my family off the wall?
- No.
We actually just came for a vacation.
- Come on.
Buy me a drink.
- Buy you a drink?
Mr Lake?
Jake Baker?
Eliot Murtaugh.
No way.
Dude, it's Eliot Murtaugh.
- That's Mike.
- Hey, Mike.
That's such a cool stick.
Can you bang any tricks?
Yeah.
Check it.
Awesome!
- I'll have clams, please.
- Sorry, there's no clams.
We have some clam fritters.
So this clambake is clamless?
Then why notjust call it a buffet?
- I feel like a stranger on this planet.
- I couldn't agree with you more.
So, Tom, I read you quit the head coaching gig at Illinois Poly.
What was that all about?
It took up a lot of hours and I wanted to spend more time with the family.
- Kudos.
- Thank you.
- That's my word for the day.
- How fun.
It's fun to have a word.
So, Katie, I guess with Tom at home changing diapers, you're tearing up the bestseller list.
I only had the one book, but I would love to...
Excuse me.
Waiter.
Another Scotch, por favor.
Anybody else?
- I'm fine.
- Hey, what about Charlie?
Still playing ball?
No.
He's living downtown and he's working in a garage to pay tuition to the University of Chicago.
I did a guest spot on Monster Garage back when I was acting.
And I just love the whole engine-and-cars thing.
- So you're an actress.
That's great.
- Thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome, Sarina.
- Kudos.
- How long have you two been married?
- Six amazing months.
- Right, honey?
- Happy anniversary.
There's Mike, Jake and Sarah.
They compete in skating contests on a regular basis.
- See you.
- Hey!
Sarah!
That's good.
You gotta start with the small steps before you take the big ones.
- Mark Baker?
- Kenny the maniac!
Well, if it isn't my partner in crime.
- You're gonna get in trouble, Murtaugh.
- Only if I get caught, Baker.
Come here.
I wanna show you something.
- Please don't get me in trouble like last time.
- You worry too much.
How are your kids?
I've got three at a private school for gifted children in Lake Forest.
Two at Andover, one at Exeter.
Calvin's at Yale finishing up a field study in particle physics.
Generating a lot of interest.
Eliot was in Sports Illustrated.
Just won the snowboarding junior nationals.
- Slope style.
- Well, that was no surprise.
But I gotta say, Anne's still my superstar.
When she finishes her MBA at Harvard, she's gonna work for me at Murtaugh Enterprises.
Definitely corporate material.
Something reeks.
Get out of the way!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Look out.
She's gonna blow!
Cool.
Listen, mister, accident or not, you'll be taking the garbage out, or something you don't wanna do, for 30 days.
So sit down, please.
Everyone, quiet.
For me.
Parenting comes down to one word - "push." If you don't push, they don't do anything.
- I think it's a little more complicated.
- Is it?
"Most went through periods in their life when they worried about making car payments."
- Hey!
Gotcha!
- Yeah.
Nigel, leave Kyle's pants alone!
Look, no one was hurt.
It's fine.
In fact, why don't you come over to The Boulders sometime?
- The Boulders?
- Our cottage.
We would love to do that sometime...
Hey, kids, why don't you leave the fireworks at home?
You're all welcome at our place.
We've got Seadoos, lasers, wireless internet, plasma screens, satellite TVs, all the toys and whistles.
You know what?
Actually, we're here for quality time with the kids.
Come on, it's time to go.
We've done enough damage here.
- So we'll probably see you on the lake.
- Sure.
Another time.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you too.
Good seeing you again, Tom.
You too...
- Kate.
- Kate.
Boy, you know, when we were kids, I used to be so envious of Tom Baker.
He just had it all.
Well, I guess the Gucci loafer's on the other foot now, isn't it?
- Everyone, straight to bed.
- What a moron.
- He's our son.
- Not Mark, he's a kid.
Murtaugh. "Seems like you could use the word 'push'."
Next time we see him, let's agree to ignore him.
- There's not gonna be a next time.
- I don't know if the kids will agree.
You think that water slide could compete with the tire swing I'm gonna put up?
Rise and shine!
Daylight's burning.
It is breakfast at the Bakers', day one!
Come on, sleepy heads.
Is there a particular reason that we're eating breakfast outside?
- 'Cause it's a beautiful day at Lake Winnetka.
- It's vacation, sweetheart.
And there's the rest of the clan.
Come on.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, look.
Hey!
Welcome to the land o' plenty.
It still smells the same here.
Like dead leaves, unwashed animals and murky lake water.
- It's called fresh air, sweetheart.
- Watch the hat.
- Hey, guys.
- Come on, let's eat.
We're gonna need a forklift to get Lorraine's suitcase outta here.
What have I been here, 30 seconds, and you're already making fun of me?
Yeah, that was my foot.
- Is that suitcase just for make-up?
- Whatever, Butch.
Big breakfast, everybody, so you have enough room for family activities.
- Family activities?
- Appleschmear.
Fishing for Big Daddy.
The tire swing, the diving board.
- I'm boarding.
- Kenneth has video games.
We were gonna use the Murtaughs' internet to research for the academic decathlon.
Precisely.
We need the extra hours.
Well, you got all vacation to go over to that place.
We have all vacation to do the family activities too.
Sarah, what about you?
You wanna hang out with Dad?
Actually, I was gonna go boarding with Jake.
And Eliot.
Well, you know, I guess we could do lake stuff another day.
Here we go.
Scones.
Henry.
Jake.
All right.
Leave it there, the dog will get it.
Did you nail down an apartment?
I'm just waiting to hear.
I'll bet you could get a place in Chicago for half the rent.
Dad, I thought we made a deal.
That dock needs work.
- Where are you going?
- The hardware store.
I'll fix this place up.
- You got a crazy look.
What are you getting?
- Tools!
Honey.
Honey.
OK.
Do not stand up.
Do you hear me?
Dad!
Dad!
Hello?
Dad!
Hey, kids.
Tire swing ready!
Tire swing not ready.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.
Get bored over at the Murtaughs'?
No.
We're going back after study time.
You guys are making time for your studies?
I'm really proud of you.
Not us, Dad.
Them.
Mr Murtaugh forces all of the kids to read and write two hours every day.
Lame.
I know.
Who are these guys?
- What?
- There's no way I'm camping out.
Yes, honey.
You can do it one night for Daddy.
Come on.
- This doesn't sit well with me.
- I know what you mean.
Lorraine, are you serious?
Is she kidding?
That's not gonna fit in your tent, Lorraine.
I'm gonna make it fit, Dad.
- Hey, come on.
We're making s'mores.
- I'll help you.
Actually, we're trying to eat only organic food.
- We're trying to eat only organic food.
- Is that for the baby?
Come on.
Baby'll love a s'more.
Party in your tummy.
Cool.
The Bakers are having a campout.
Can I go over?
Why have a campout when you can have a full-on fondue party right here?
Sweet.
Charlie, you're worse than a kitten.
Babe, that's your fourth s'more.
My parents never let me have these.
They're amazing.
Do you think we should be more strict with the kids?
No, honey.
We give them love and guidance.
What else is there, really?
Every time we turn around, they're in trouble, about to get into it, or laying out a long-term plan to create it.
Dad, how come those guys know how to camp so good?
- Hey.
Hey!
What if we sing a camp song?
- OK.
Sounds good.
What do you say we give 'em a run for their money?
Come on.
Stand up.
This guy is so competitive!
Boy, I love camping.
Yeah.
This is fun.
- Good times.
Good times.
- Good times, yeah.
Hey, kids.
Didn't you love blowing Murtaugh off the lake last night?
Kids?
Honey, they're all in the house.
- No.
- Yeah.
Hello?
Happy?
They can't spend one night in the tent?
Hey, Tom.
Now, what does that show-off want?
What a day.
Hey, Tom?
Boy, you have got this place looking...
Anyway, I see the troops are sleeping in.
They're already up.
They're out cutting wood and making biscuits and blazing a new trail out back - nothing out of the ordinary.
Yeah.
Really impressive.
Listen, the missus and I are thinking of putting on a little spread.
Since the kids are getting along so well, why don't you and the gang come to The Boulders for brunch?
- Actually, we have to...
- Cool, what time?
Mimosas at noon, on the dot.
Yeah!
Attagirl.
Take it away, honey.
Adios, amigo.
- Isn't he like the coolest dad ever?
- Yeah.
Cool.
Whoa, dude!
Awesome, dude.
Kids, you stay right here.
Welcome to The Boulders.
- Hey.
Let's say hello.
- Hi.
Hey.
Thanks for having us.
Where's the gift shop?
You brought your dog.
- Sorry.
Just say "sit."
- Down, Gunner.
Tom.
Baker!
Somebody help.
- I'm fine.
- They're called obedience schools, Baker!
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Tie Fido up for five minutes.
- Honey, he's fine.
Just let him play.
We don't want that animal near the dining set.
It was a gift from the king of Thailand.
Mark, there's a leash in the car.
Get it.
- Why don't we all go inside?
- Good idea.
I'll be right back.
Sarah.
You wanna go on the Seadoo with me and Jake before we eat?
Yeah.
Sure.
Cool.
Let's go.
Are you coming or not, dude?
Yeah.
Jimmy.
Almost forgot.
Tom, for heaven's sake.
You didn't have to do this.
- "Sparkling Cheesehead"?
- Wisconsin's finest bubbly.
I'm sure it is.
Might have to let this baby age about two, three hundred years, Tom.
Superstar, do me a favor.
Take this to the cellar and bring a bottle of Taittinger.
- Sure.
- I'll give you a hand.
- It's a fantastic place.
- It's not much, but I call it a second home.
How come you guys haven't built your own house up here?
With 12 kids, you've gotta use the money for food and water.
I bet if Tom had kept thatjob at Illinois Poly he could have built a place like this.
Well, life's full of choices.
Some good, some not so good.
Honey, why don't you take Kate and show her the dining set the king of Thailand gave us?
- OK, honey.
- I'd love to look at the plates from a king.
- Don't get lost, honey.
- Tom, I wanna show you something.
Feast your eyes on these honeys, Tom.
Albino ironwood, right out of the Peruvian rainforest.
You can still smell the jungle on 'em.
Go ahead, take a whiff.
Come on.
Rest your honker on the log and take a whiff.
- Smells like global warming.
- That's moss.
It's moss, Tom.
Well, this is the trophy room.
- Are those your kids?
- Yeah.
That's the Murtaugh victory reel.
- It's on a loop.
- It's a good room.
I'll tell you why I love this room so much, Tom.
All the trophies, the ribbons, the prizes - past, present and future.
It's proof that children can be groomed to reflect the best aspects of any given gene pool.
- You just have to keep them on a short leash.
- I couldn't agree more.
My Anne's proof of that.
You're looking a lot more put together than you did a few years ago.
Thanks.
Remember your nose was too big, and that skin irritation on your hand?
Ltjust kept working its way up your arm and into your neck...
I'm glad that it's gone, though.
Looks good.
Well, if I remember correctly, you weren't so hot yourself.
That mutt could use a shorter leash too.
She's so cool.
Yeah, the kids and I spent a weekend putting that dock together.
Nothing like a little manual labor to keep you humble.
Sit down, Tom.
So Jimmy has matching pants to that shirt?
Boy, this place wasn't put together overnight.
- Does Daddy know about your tattoo?
- No.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm so sorry.
It's OK.
I'm fine.
- It's like spring break.
Hope I win.
- I've got a shirt you can borrow.
- A shirt?
OK.
- Mom, I...
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- If my dad finds out before I...
- You'll get grounded?
Please, just don't say anything.
Nice hands.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey, Dad.
You should see Mr Murtaugh's new Seadoo.
That's terrific.
Now turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Why?
Turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Are you still in touch with your dark gifts?
Punking, practical jokes, soaking underwear and...
- Meat.
- Yeah.
- Classic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm in touch.
Why?
- I have a mission for you.
Who's the target?
Murtaugh.
I can help you.
Hi.
- As long as I don't do time for the crime.
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Done.
No grounding.
No allowance dockage.
No spiel about the difference between right and wrong.
And you have no problem with the methods that I choose.
It's your contract, do with it what you will.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Hey, give Daddy a hug.
Nail him.
Guys, guys.
Guys!
I have a mission for you.
- It's top-secret, and it's high-priority.
- Yeah?
What is it?
Come on.
I'll show you.
- Positions.
- Check.
My gosh.
It's a purple bigfoot.
- What are you talking about?
- A purple bigfoot!
- A what?
- I don't see anything.
Made you look, made you look.
- Made you look.
- You are so stupid.
- Did I mention the dining set was a gift?
- The king of Thailand.
Yeah, you did.
- Give me that roll.
- I see your kids can't wait to get started.
Well, that's just the way they are.
Hey, you guys.
No eating until everyone's seated.
- Eyes up here, honey.
- Doesn't she look hot?
Doesn't hold a candle to you, honey.
Come on, let's sit down.
- Where have you been all my life?
- All right.
- Tom, right over here.
- Thank you.
Ignore the place card.
Sit next to your wife.
Fine.
Fine, if you want chaos.
Right here, Tom.
Believe me, I don't mind.
Dad.
Don't...
The seat cushion is soft.
- So, you two play tennis?
- Yeah.
- You're in the meat seat.
- What?
I knew that dog was gonna be trouble.
Sit!
My china.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
It's OK.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't.
I'm so sorry.
I'm really embarrassed.
Thank you for the lovely shirt.
I insist that you send me a bill for this.
Don't even think about it.
What's a few thousand dollars here or there?
The main thing is you had a good time.
We'll talk about it later.
I'll see you on the tennis court.
Bring your A game.
- Bye.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
- That was not nothing.
This was not nothing.
That was something.
All right.
In the house.
I know.
I'm a horrible father.
- Honey, you broke your promise.
- What promise?
That you'd not get involved in this competitive thing.
It's just all so infantile.
- He tried to tell us how to raise the kids.
- Meaning?
- He thinks the kids are...
- Did he say it?
No, but you could tell that he implied that's what he thought, that the kids were...
That's right.
"I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-l-am."
Aren't you a little old for that book?
- She's reading to the baby.
- Reading to the baby?
Unborn babies, they're comforted by the sound of their mother's voice.
- Just don't spoil my linebacker.
- The baby's gonna be what it wants to be.
Just let us be the parents, OK, Dad?
Come on, Bud.
I'm hungry.
Yeah.
Me too.
- Hi, Mr Baker.
- Hi, Eliot.
What's up?
- I was looking for Sarah.
- You mean Jake?
Sarah and I and Calvin, we're going boarding this afternoon.
Well, she'll be back soon.
- OK.
I'll just wait on the dock.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Sit down.
What do you do for a living, Eliot?
- I'm in eighth grade.
- Yeah.
Right.
- And how's that going for you?
- Fine.
- Are you on any teams?
- Football, boarding and baseball.
All that focus on sports - that must impact your grades quite a bit.
No.
Actually, you know, I'm an honors student.
- You play any instruments?
- Drums.
You're probably in one of those punk bands, right?
Timpani.
You know, school orchestra.
- Hey, Eliot.
- See you, Mr Baker.
Later, dude...
Dad.
Guys.
- What now?
- Mind if I go waterboarding with you?
It's kneeboarding, and I'm pretty sure you can't do it.
If Jimmy can do it, I can.
You must be Calvin.
- Nice to meet you.
I just got back from Yale.
- Congratulations.
I'll just squeeze in over here.
There we go.
- Is everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Fun?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go first?
Guys, keep an eye on him, all right?
You ready, Mr Baker?
OK, I'm...
- Sorry he interrogated you.
- My dad would have done the same thing.
- Really?
- You should come to my house sometime.
He's really easy and likes to keep low-key.
- Do you have a favorite subject?
- Probably math.
Stop!
You'll do better next time, Mr Baker.
It's OK.
- Are you sure he'll be OK?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.
Dad!
Are you OK?
It's all good.
Well...
I'll go put on a little perfume.
Sarah, Eliot seems OK.
- I see why you like him.
- Somebody's turning red.
Shut up!
Thanks a lot, Dad.
- What did I say?
- Men can be so clueless.
Honey, men are clueless.
- I'll go talk to her.
- Mom, let me do this, OK?
Trust me, I've got experience in the area of parental harassment.
Hey, I totally know how you feel.
How are you?
Dad can be pretty hands-on, in-your-face sometimes.
Just leave me alone.
A, I'm never trying to help her again.
And B, I cannot wait to move to New York.
- What are you doing here?
- This is where I run.
What are you doing?
- I like to get out of the house.
- Take a break from the perfect daughter bit?
Hey, I'm not the only one who's putting on an act for Daddy around here.
You've hated the city since we were kids.
- Why go to school there?
- Seemed like the right thing to do.
Did it seem like the right thing to do because your parents said it was the right thing to do?
No.
My parents wanted me closer to home, that's why.
Are you gonna live at home forever?
I just gotta figure out my next move and do it.
How about you, superstar?
What's the master plan?
Somehow I gotta tell my dad I'm not built for corporate life.
- Good luck.
- So for now, I'm just gonna draw.
- What do you draw?
- Stay still, Baker.
Whoa.
Yeah, right.
You're not drawing me, 'cause I'm gonna...
Right here?
Is this good?
- If I stay here?
It might be better...
- Stop smiling.
- Sarah, come on.
Hurry up!
- OK.
OK.
- Has anybody seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.
No, I haven't.
- Have you seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.
Chiseler!
You chiseling little...
Great.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, guys.
- Good to see you.
- Hi.
Nice shoes.
Kidding.
Let's warm up.
OK, let's do it.
- Come on, Murtaugh!
- Got it.
I don't remember you out here when we were kids.
Dad didn't allow us to come out into the woods.
OK, I'm done.
That's Charlie Baker figuring out his next move.
- You're good.
- Tell my dad.
Maybe he'll let me transfer to Madison Art School.
- You wanna live up here and go to school?
- This lake is my favorite place on the planet.
- Why?
- I've always fantasized about moving here.
I don't know, maybe open up a garage or something.
- Looks like you figured out your next move.
- I think you're right.
Wanna go for a walk or something?
- Is Charlie Baker asking me out on a date?
- I'm not sure our fathers would approve.
Let's go.
Yours.
Nice.
Nice!
This is mine.
- It's these shoes.
- OK.
All right.
A poor workman blames his tools, Tom.
- Just serve it.
- This is payback for the china.
Come on.
Give me your best, Jimmy, give me your best.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- I got it.
Mine.
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Mine.
- Whoa.
- It's turbo.
- I'm in so much trouble.
There's no way.
- Don't be a wimp.
- I'm not a wimp.
- Come on.
Get in.
- OK, just one little cruise.
Come on, Baker.
I'm getting old here.
Just be careful.
Whoa!
Slow down!
Mr and Mrs Baker, excuse me.
There's a call from security over at the gift shop.
- What's this about?
- Just follow me.
Slow down!
Stop!
Slow down!
We're willing to let it slide if you promise to keep your kids under control.
I really appreciate that.
We'll take care of it.
- There you go.
Thanks, Skippy.
- Thank you, Mr Murtaugh.
Are you just gonna talk to her?
How I discipline my kids is none of your business.
You know, I've been trying to say this in a nice way, but...
Well, there's a reason your kids are screw-ups.
My kids screwed up.
They are not screw-ups.
You're not strict enough.
Parenting isn't a popularity contest, Tom, but I guess if you knew that, your kids wouldn't be so undisciplined.
The only problem with my kids is they're hanging out with yours.
It wasn't my daughter who got caught stealing.
It wasn't my son who trashed a tennis court.
Do you actually think I'm screwing up my kids, Baker?
Yeah.
And one day they're gonna crack.
Well, why don't we test that theory?
On Labor Day.
Murtaughs versus Bakers.
For the cup.
You're on.
We'll see you there.
Let's go.
Did you just agree to that competition thing and the cup?
Yeah.
OK, missy, let's go walk and talk.
Now, tell me what this is all about, because it's so not you.
- I was embarrassed.
- Look at me, honey.
Embarrassed about what?
Make-up.
Honey, you know you can come to me any time with anything.
You know that, right?
And I know why you wanted the make-up.
It was for Eliot, right?
Yeah.
I'm just not pretty like Nora or Lorraine.
I thought maybe the make-up would help.
You're beautiful.
I want you to remember something else that's really important.
When you like a boy, never be anybody but yourself.
Eliot liked you without make-up, didn't he?
- Do you think he really likes me?
- How could he not?
- No more felonies.
Deal?
- Deal.
Good.
- The Labor Day Cup's gonna be a bloodbath.
- You got that right.
From now on, no seeing the Murtaughs, no talking to them, no thinking about them.
- Can't we compete and still see them?
- No.
Right now, I am not a father.
I am a coach.
And we're gonna be training twice a day, every day, starting outside in ten minutes.
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks.
Good.
Lorraine, come on.
Push-ups.
One, two.
Now back up to jumping jacks.
- Lorraine, come on.
- OK.
And toss.
Toss.
- Toss.
Toss.
- Dad!
- Just toss.
- Dad, lay off.
- Toss!
- I'm tossing.
No crying.
- Step back.
- That's it.
I can't handle the pressure, Dad!
Eggs cost money.
OK, it's a three-legged race, but run as if you had two!
On your mark, get set, go.
Go.
Let's go.
- Your fault!
- Hey!
Come on, come on, get in.
Come on.
- Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
- Dad!
We're not Murtaughs!
Take a deep swing.
Boom, just like that.
Give it a good one.
Come on.
One more.
That's a zero.
I really love having a family dinner where all you can hear is forks hitting the plates.
You know, this could be our last chance together and you're totally ruining it.
I'm glad we're moving to Houston.
And so is Iron Mike or Donna Baker Butkus McNulty.
Bulk up.
You're burning a hole in my face.
Tom.
You've gotta stop this whole training camp thing.
This is not some little fence-line squabble.
This is an epic battle between two families.
No.
No, no, honey.
I think this is Tom versus Jimmy.
I'm sorry, General, but you're losing the respect of your troops.
That's dangerous.
Give the kids some space.
Are you asking me to back out?
No, honey.
It's just...
Especially with Sarah.
This is her first crush.
Come on.
- What, with Eliot?
- Yes.
She needs to know that we trust her.
She couldn't come to me and tell me she wanted to wear make-up.
Is that the kind of relationship you want her to have with us?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Hi.
Let's run.
Just leave it.
They'll get somebody.
The kids drop stuff all the time and leave me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
- How do you manage 12 kids?
- With great difficulty.
Trust me.
Good, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.
You've got a lot of fruit.
I'd get some of this refined sugar.
It's great for negotiating purposes or whatever.
Jimmy's gone overboard with this tough love thing.
The kids are miserable and he doesn't even see it.
He and Tom bring out the best in each other.
I'm actually getting a kick out of it.
Very entertaining.
- And exhausting.
- This is good.
If tonight's good, I'll ask my dad.
So hopefully tonight will work.
OK.
See you.
Not my little girl.
Hey, Dad.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I just need you to help me pace out 25 yards for the egg race, starting here, OK?
There you go.
- Yeah.
- OK, go ahead.
- Hey, Dad, I was...
- Those steps are too small.
- Those steps...
- Can I go to the movies with Eliot tonight?
...are too big.
I guess so.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Nora has to urinate, and a full bladder puts inordinate strain on the embryotic sac...
Kim!
Thank you.
We could just go with "hurry up."
Hurry up!
I need Lorraine.
You get Lorraine, I'll pee outside.
Hey.
It's me.
How's it going?
Eliot asked me out, and I'm kind of new to the dating thing, so...
- Are you gonna make me beg?
- I was thinking about it.
Come on.
Let's start with your make-up.
Lorraine...
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.
- Pink?
- Come on.
Can't we do, like, a skin color?
There you go.
It looks good.
Hey, guys.
Guys.
I need everybody's attention.
Sarah's about to come downstairs, and she's going on her date tonight.
She looks a little different, so I would really appreciate it if you guys could give her the respect that you never gave me, and not ridicule her style choices before she enters the world of multi-gender interaction.
So go about your little chores and act completely natural.
Lorraine.
I think you're going to do just fine in New York.
Thank you.
Hubba-hubba.
You look very pretty, honey.
You always do.
Thank you.
Well, I'm going to the movies.
Well, sounds good.
Need some money?
No.
I have some from lawn mowing.
- Limo's here.
- There's Mr Murtaugh.
Well, have fun, and I'll pick you up outside the theater at nine.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye, cutie.
I'll save a spot for you on the varsity.
Have fun.
- Cute, isn't she?
- Yeah.
Seems like yesterday that was you, missy.
- You're not gonna start crying, are you, Dad?
- I'm a football coach, remember?
- I like Henrietta.
- You are not calling it Henrietta.
All right.
What have we got to eat?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Honey, do you want something to eat?
Tom, do you want something to eat?
No.
You know what?
Actually, I should go get Sarah.
It's 7:30.
The movie just started.
I'm not going directly.
I'm just gonna stop and get gas first.
There's bound to be traffic, 'cause it's Labor Day weekend.
- Sure there is.
- I'll get going.
And I don't trust those fish clocks.
They're notoriously slow.
I love you, sweetheart.
Thank you.
One, please.
What are you doing here?
If you must know, I'm here to make sure this movie is appropriate for our children.
It's rated G.
Sir, could you please sit down?
- What are you doing here so early?
- Father of the daughter always arrives early.
- Everybody knows that.
- Excuse me.
Is there a problem here?
- He's harassing me.
- He's guilty of overparenting.
If you two can't keep it down, I'm going to throw both of you out.
My God.
Look at this.
What?
He's stretching.
- He's doing "the move."
- What move?
You're sitting in the theater, you fake a yawn...
Oh, boy, am I tired.
Hand comes over.
Then a little while later, head comes over, giving you extra reach here.
Mom, look at those two down there.
See what I mean?
Sweet Jesus.
- Warning number two.
- He was showing me "the move."
Do you mind?
- You don't know "the move"?
- No.
I don't know "the move," OK?
And I wasn't a hormone-crazed Romeo when I was a kid.
I had self-control.
- I had social sophistication, like my son.
- Be quiet down there!
- Your son has hormones like every teenager.
- Meaning what?
Meaning on the sophistication scale, he's one step above ape.
- Are you calling my son an ape?
- He's an ape like every other male teenager.
- Take it back.
- I'm not gonna take it back.
Take it...
Take it back.
- Were you gonna poke me?
- No, I was not gonna poke you.
- You were gonna poke me.
- Because you were asking for it.
If I'm asking for it, why don't you give it to me?
- You want a poke?
- What's going on down there?
- Call that a poke?
- I call that a practice.
- Give me your best poke.
I want your best.
- You're asking for it.
I do.
Yeah.
Hey!
Call somebody.
Somebody help.
- Hey, honey, how did it go?
- Dad was totally spying on me.
You ruined everything.
There's no way that I'm competing for you in that stupid cup tomorrow.
- I can't believe you did that.
- Really, Dad, that is so Big Brother.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on, Bud, let's put this baby to bed.
Not cool, Dad.
You and Jimmy aren't so different, Dad.
Different styles, yeah, but same result.
Let's go, guys.
Honey.
Honey, we talked about this, didn't we?
The tighter you hang on, the more they're gonna pull away.
Right?
I'll go talk to her.
Well, we're gonna go compete for the cup.
Couldn't get any more volunteers?
You gonna come and watch us kick some hiney?
Well, maybe I will, honey, when I get everybody fed.
I'm sorry.
- OK, guys.
Come on, let's go.
- Come on, Dad.
And I'm sorry too.
- Did Dad go?
- Yep.
With Kyle and Nigel.
Hey.
The Chiseler's got my wallet.
- Check it out.
- Must have an escape hatch.
- Look at all this stuff.
- That's mine from, like, the '80s.
Careful.
Careful.
Let me see that.
Look at this.
It's our old team flag.
We lost to the Murtaughs by two points.
Yeah, 'cause Mom fell in the sack race.
Daddy carried me all the way home.
Fond memories.
You know your father.
He wants to be a part of every single one of them.
That's why he's having such a hard time letting go.
But one thing - no matter what Daddy says, if he's in a good mood or a bad mood, you're his favorite team, right?
And left.
And right.
And left.
And right.
And left...
Bakers.
What gives, Tom?
Couldn't rally your team?
It's all I've got, but it's enough to take you down, Murtaugh.
Are you kidding me?
You'll be lucky to beat the Doobners.
- We'll see.
Come on, guys.
- We'll see.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th annual Lake Winnetka Labor Day Cup.
Now, we have seven families competing in ten events today.
The family winning the most events will win the cup.
Simple enough.
So let's get to it, all right?
Contestants, here we go.
OK, guys.
Let's do this.
Hey, Dad.
We're here.
Dad!
There's the team.
There's the team.
You can't keep the varsity down.
And I promise never to go on a date with you and Eliot again.
Hey, Murtaugh!
This is our year!
Let's see what you got, Tom.
- OK, Murtaughs.
- Huddling.
I've been ajerk all week, but that's old news.
- Get loose.
Don't let 'em intimidate you.
- Yeah!
You each have a special talent.
I want you to use it.
I don't care if we win or lose.
Just do your best.
OK.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop with the nicey-nice.
Here's the game plan.
We'll step on their throats and press until they stop breathing.
- Yeah!
- Get focused and stay with the game plan.
- What would that be?
- We don't have a game plan, but...
- Chin up.
Charge the mountain!
- Exactly!
That's the game plan.
OK, break on three.
One, two, three.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, go.
Come on, go.
Go, go!
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah, Mark!
Come on.
Go!
Go!
Charge it, charge it, charge it!
Good job.
OK.
That's OK.
- Bull's-eye!
- One for the Bakers!
Come on, Charlie.
- That's it.
That's it.
- Go!
Go!
Go, superstar.
Yeah!
- Gotta be tough, Baker.
Gotta be tough.
- What is this?
Out.
- Here we go, Tom.
- I'm OK, Murtaugh.
Look out.
Not your sport?
Go for ajog.
Come on.
Keep up.
Reverse.
Couldn't have asked for a better day.
Look out!
Ouch.
Well, folks, for the first time since 1961, our Labor Day Cup has ended in a tie.
The Miller family will be taking third place.
And to determine second place and our champion, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are going to have a canoe race from here to the State Forest end of the park and back.
And all family members must participate.
Mike, I got a daughter who's due in a week.
She can't do that.
Tom, maybe you can work something out with Jimmy here.
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit, Tom.
Well...
She can't do it, so we're done.
And congratulations.
I'm going, Dad.
You just pissed off a severely hormonal pregnant woman.
Let's do this!
Nora?
- Are you sure?
- I need a life jacket.
- Go, Bakers.
- Come on, Murtaughs.
- Lose those shoes.
They're fancy and new.
- What?
Yours are the same.
I'm a mom.
I need the height.
Take those off.
Mom.
Mine tie my new outfit in together.
Stay on the north side of the lake.
There's less wind.
- Thanks, Murtaugh.
- You're welcome, Baker.
Let's go, superstar.
It's supposed to be fun.
- You ready?
- Ready.
- On your marks.
- Murtaugh!
- Get set.
- Murtaugh!
Go, Bakers!
Go, Bakers!
Come on, we'll catch up.
Let's go.
We're gonna win this, Murtaughs!
Come on.
Put some muscle in it, Bakers.
Stroke.
- Stroke.
- Stroke.
Come on, superstar.
Come on, Kenneth.
- Not this time, Murtaugh.
- That's what you think.
Stroke, stroke.
I think we're taking on water.
It's me.
My God!
My God!
Nora's waterjust broke.
Jimmy!
- Row!
Row!
- Jimmy!
- Something's wrong, Jimmy.
- He's trying to pull a fast one.
Now, paddle.
- I don't believe it.
- What if somebody's hurt?
Honey, we have a substantial lead.
It's a trick.
- How can you be sure?
- I don't wanna lose.
Now, paddle.
Stroke.
OK, everyone, calm down.
- If we cut through, the road's not far.
- Can you get us there?
- Hello.
Nature boy, remember?
- Let's go.
- Sit tight.
- Go faster.
- No, Bud.
Stay with Nora.
- Row.
Annie, what are you doing?
What are you doing, superstar?
Paddle.
I'm not a superstar, Dad.
I'm just a person who's trying to have her own life.
And this is not my idea of living.
It's yours.
Like my tattoo?
- Annie, get back in this boat.
- You'll have to win it without me too.
Eliot, don't you dare.
Don't you...
- I'm outta here.
- Kenneth!
- Not cool, Dad.
- Becky, don't you...
- You've gotta lighten up.
- Daniel!
- We like the Bakers.
- Yeah, Dad.
Lisa!
Robin!
OK, that's it.
You know what?
You kids are gonna be cut off if you don't, you know...
No more charge accounts.
Think about that.
- What is wrong with you?
- I want to win!
You don't get it, Sarina.
It's not me.
It's him.
It's Tom.
He was always the popular one.
He was the one everybody liked.
Everybody.
All the girls.
All the parents liked him.
- My own father even liked him better.
- That was 18 years before I was born.
Get over it.
Look, your kids are trying to tell you something.
And unless you wanna start looking for wife number four, you'd better listen.
Now, paddle.
- Watch out.
- Are you sure you're OK?
- 50 cents says it's a girl.
- I'll take that bet.
- I'm in.
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- I'm all right, I'm all right.
- I got you, I got you!
That's OK.
I got my hips to balance me.
How are you feeling?
- Cramping a little.
- OK, how often?
Just a couple of times so far.
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- Pay attention to her!
Is she OK?
Yeah.
She's delivering lakeside, but yeah.
Did you swim all the way here?
- Baker, what's going on?
- Nora's having her baby.
We need a hospital.
- What can I do to help?
- You can help with Nora.
- Mark's on point.
Right?
- I know the area really well.
Dad forced me to read topographical maps of this area, for no apparent reason.
Hey, that's my boy.
Lead the way, Kenneth Murtaugh.
My dad has let me have almost every animal in the world, which makes me an expert on scat trails.
- That's my boy.
- Point us the right way, I'll find a scat trail.
- What's "scat"?
- Animal poop.
Cool, we're following poop.
OK, I'm a little competitive.
- I know.
- Go!
Go!
- Come on, guys.
This way.
- There's a road up ahead.
Yeah.
We did it!
Come on, guys, this way.
Come on.
Hurry!
Come on, hurry up!
I'll take it from here.
I got it.
My daughter is about to deliver and I need to get her in.
I don't want her to feel any pain.
I want the baby to be healthy.
Get it?
Good.
- If I could get you to fill out...
- I wouldn't mess with her if I were you, OK?
Right.
- Wow.
- She's having a baby.
Stay calm!
Can we get a chair over here?
!
- Get me in a wheelchair.
- I need a wheelchair, stat!
Get the chair!
- My God.
My God.
- Good luck.
It must be this way.
That way.
All right.
Family only in the delivery room.
- Whoa, whoa!
You're all family?
- Yes.
- Help me out here.
- I'm her mother.
- Of course.
- Kate.
Do your thing.
- OK, come on.
Let's go.
- Tom, actually, we'd like Lorraine to come.
We want you to be the godmother.
Really?
Whoa!
Having a baby here!
- We'll try to get you a linebacker, Tom.
- Come on, everybody.
Come on.
This is a hospital.
You guys have to be quiet.
Tom.
You mind if we wait with you?
That'd be great.
They're good kids, Jimmy.
All of 'em.
And you're saying we have nothing to do with it?
They're born hard-wired.
- Look what we found.
- Check it out.
Hey.
Just be sure and disinfect them.
It's a bedpan, Kenny.
Take it off.
- So your kid gets my kid to wear a bedpan...
- I didn't tell him to do it.
You look in the face of a six-month-old and that's the way they are.
You look like you have something to say.
I'm done with the city, Dad.
I'm gonna open up my own garage and I'm moving up here.
And I wanna audit art classes at Madison.
- Pardon me?
- Dad, I wanna be an artist.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Jimmy.
Although it does sound pretty exciting.
- Sweetheart, is this what you really want?
- I'm sure.
You know, Annie, I was just trying to be a good father.
I know.
- What do you think?
- Sounds like you got your mind made up.
I do.
You OK with that?
Yeah.
I think I am.
Excuse me.
Tom?
You wanna meet your grandson?
Yeah.
You did a good job, honey.
Really good job.
That's a big boy.
Too bad he wasn't there to help us win the cup.
He'll get a chance.
Mike Romanow gave me a deal.
Now we own the big house at the lake.
It'll be nice having you in the neighborhood, Bud.
You Murtaughs better start cranking out grandkids if you wanna compete.
You guys.
My godchild is trying to snooze.
So, any ideas on names?
I think we're going to go with "Tom."
'Cause you taught us that there's no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.
And you're about as good as they get.
Say hi to Grandpa.
Go on.
You're so beautiful.
Tom.
Hey, Tom.
Welcome to family.
Letting go is the hardest thing you can do as a parent.
You have to settle with the past, engage in the present, and believe in the future.
That vacation at Lake Winnetka reminded Tom and me that we're always learning as parents, and that the bond is forever.
Even as the kids grow up and venture out on their own, we'll always be with them and they'll always be with us.
Because life is a voyage that's homeward bound.
Is this my normal face?
Hi, Poo-poo.
You want a treat?
Can I redo that?
What are we gonna do?
She'll never walk again, I'll tell you that.
THE END Subtitles by:
They say that starting a family is an act of optimism.
Well, Tom and I were clearly very, very, very optimistic.
There are always good times and difficult ones along the way.
And with 12 kids, you learn a lot of lessons.
But the one that you never get used to is that moment when you look your child in the eye and find yourself having to say the most difficult word of all: goodbye.
All right, stay together.
There she is.
Sergio Archer.
Look, she's right there.
Robert Armstrong.
Peter Bailey.
Lorraine Baker.
-
- He's really gotten good.
-
- Yeah.
My gosh.
Kicking, kicking.
All right, all right.
It is time to toast the graduate.
Lorraine, we are all so proud of you, for keeping your chin up and charging the mountain.
And for being a truly unique and wonderful person.
And for getting that internship at Allure magazine.
Did you know about that?
Even though I'll be trying to convince you staying here is a better choice for your future than moving to dirty, expensive, crime--ridden New York City, but here's to Lorraine.
OK.
My daughter Nora and her husband Bud, you wanna say something?
And our future linebacker.
We go.
Let's go.
First of all, congratulations, Lorraine.
Bud and I hope that our baby will be as cool and accomplished as you.
And second of all, I don't mean to make this toast all about Bud and I,
-- but we have some kind of big news.
-
- You know about this?
I've just been offered the vice--presidency of a new advertising firm.
Hey!
Congratulations.
Yeah!
In Houston.
We're moving in September.
Thank you.
Great.
Wow.
-
- Does this mean we won't be uncles?
-
- You'll be uncles no matter where we live.
Maybe they thought it was the best way to break it to us.
-
- Quite a surprise.
-- l'll say.
Can I get a beer and a white wine?
-
- Hey, you guys.
-
- Hey.
-- l feel like I'm losing two daughters now.
-
- You're not losing us.
I hope you have help, cos with no family there and you being a first--time mom...
-
- You'll be at work all day...
-- l'm not gonna be at work all the time.
We're gonna be fine.
And whatever house we get is gonna have a room reserved for you.
At least you're gonna stay for the touch football game.
-
- We can't.
We have Lamaze.
-
- This will help your breathing.
We're gonna see you soon.
You're driving, right?
-
- See you.
-
- Bye, sweetheart.
There you go, sir.
That's...
They seem so casual and cavalier.
Well, time for me to get my hands dirty.
You're working?
What about the game?
Rematch against the cousins.
I've got student loans to pay off, Dad.
-
- OK.
See you.
-
- Be safe, honey.
Did everybody forget touch football was a tradition here?
-
- Honey, you've got ten other kids to draft.
-- l forgot.
-
- You forgot?
-
- Lorraine.
-
- Staying for the game?
-
- No, didn't Mom tell you?
I'm spending the weekend at Beth's.
I leave in five minutes.
Love you.
Bye.
Hey, guys.
Ready for some touch?
-
- Mike and I are competing at the skate park.
-- l volunteered at the animal shelter.
Nigel, Kyle, football.
All right.
-- l'm here, Coach.
-
- You just made the varsity, little lady.
Come on.
There you go.
Go, go, go!
-- l'll block for you.
Here we go.
Go!
-
- Athletes!
-
- Are you OK?
-
- Yeah.
Somehow I thought it'd get easier.
Ten minutes ago, they were all over us.
Now they don't want to be seen with us in public.
-
- What's that doing here?
-- l bet Lorraine was looking through this.
That's sweet.
The cutest.
Look at her.
She looks just like my mom.
A lot of memories.
Summers in Wisconsin.
Swimming.
All of us camping out.
Everyone together. lsn't that sweet?
That had to be the last time we were there.
What was it?
Three or four years ago?
-
- Look at Sarah.
No teeth.
-
- We were one tight unit back then.
Even if we never beat the Murtaughs for the Labor Day Cup.
Look at that.
Jimmy Murtaugh -
- Mr Competitive.
He was so desperate to win, he would... he would win.
All the time.
Even when we were kids, this guy was...
All right, honey.
Let's not go there.
You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.
Go back to the lake.
The whole family on vacation, like we used to.
I could call Mike Romanow and see if the house is available.
It's a great idea, but the kids are in summer school and Nora's pregnant.
That's exactly why we should do it, Kate.
We said it.
Life's blazing by.
Let's go back to the lake one last time.
We did have such good times there, honey.
You and I had alone time, which was nice.
There's the proof.
-
- Hey, Gunner.
-
- Hey, Gunner.
Let's call Mike Romanow, honey.
You're conferencing with all of us and Lorraine.
-
- Hi, Charlie.
-
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
-- lt's Lorraine.
-
- We have a surprise.
We rented the big house up in Lake Winnetka.
-
- Winnetka?
That's my middle name.
-
- And Lake is mine.
And it's where we're gonna spend Labor Day, just like in the old days.
Dad, I'm gonna be very pregnant then.
And I'm gonna be apartment hunting in New York in August.
-- l wanna hang out with my friends.
-
- How come we're named after a house?
Good question.
Your middle name is Winnetka and your middle name is Lake
-- cos you were conceived there.
-
- What does "conceived" mean?
-- lt means Mom and Dad...
-
- Had a conversation that we'd discuss it later.
Kyle and me will go anyplace that has our name on it.
-
- Bingo!
Come on.
-
- Yeah. I love the lake. I'm in.
-- l guess I can cancel a couple of gigs.
-
- Bingo!
-
- OK, we're in.
-
- All right.
We agree to participate.
We'll bring the wakeboards and totally dominate.
-
- OK, we're in.
-
- All right!
And that leaves Lorraine.
-
- Come on.
You'll have fun.
-
- Come on, Lorraine.
Just come.
All right, here's the deal. I'll go to the lake if Dad stops nagging me about not going to New York.
Deal.
That's a dozen.
We're going to the lake.
-
- Who cut the cheese?
-
- Gunner farted.
We'll drive up tomorrow or the next day.
-
- You missed.
-- l love you too.
Bye.
Lorraine's got a line on a place.
She and Charlie will come in a couple of days.
Couple of days?
The whole point of the vacation is that the whole family is together.
Honey, relax.
All right.
Remember this?
Look at the lake. lt looks fantastic.
-
- Does it look great or what?
-
- Come on, kids.
All right.
Slide out.
Hurry up.
Everyone out.
Come on.
Let's check the place out.
-
- Look at it.
-
- This is it?
-
- Remember this?
-- lt looks smaller.
-
- And more disgusting.
-
- Yeah.
Why can't we rent that place?
Well, that place is new.
-
- This place is...
-
- Older, but still nice.
Yeah.
And that might have a water slide, but our place has...
There's stairs.
They're fun.
So unload, camper dudes!
Girls in the north bunk room, boys in the south.
-
- Bud and Nora in the loft.
Come on!
-
- Careful.
Hey, Bud, give the phone a rest.
We're on vacation.
Hey.
How did Mad Dog like the trip?
Maybe the baby's not gonna be a "Mad Dog", Tom.
But that's a classic linebacker name.
OK, how about Dick Butkus McNulty?
-
- Maybe it's gonna be a girl, Dad.
-
- Donna Butkus McNulty.
-
- We got all vacation to pick a name.
-
- Someone's here.
-
- Mike Romanow.
Good to see you.
-
- Good to see you.
Everything OK?
Shouldn't be too disorganised, only two renters this season.
-
- The lake's a lot more upscale.
-
- Thank Jimmy Murtaugh.
Remember him?
-
- Yeah.
-
- He owns most of the lake now.
That's his place over there.
Well, good for Jimmy.
-
- Hey, remember Kate?
-
- Hey, Mike.
How are you?
-
- Good to see you.
-
- Good to see you.
If you don't feel like cooking, there's a clambake up at the club.
-
- You can come as my guests.
-
- Guests?
Yeah.
Club's private now.
And renovated.
-
- Homeowners only.
Put you on the list?
-
- OK.
-
- What's going on?
-
- Stop!
The Chiseller.
-
- Tell me those aren't my keys.
-
- Get him outside, OK?
-- l remember how to handle this guy.
-- l can't believe he's still alive.
-
- You know that thing?
-
- Hey.
-
- Don't hurt him.
-- l got it. I got it.
It's a snap.
Here you go.
Hold still.
Yeah.
Leave him alone!
Gunner!
Stay!
Stay, Gunner!
-
- Get him.
-
- Gunner, stay!
Mom, watch out!
Don't light the fireworks.
-
- No explosives in the house!
-
- Nigel!
Kyle!
Gunner, come back.
-
- What was that beast?
-
- The Chiseller?
A pack rat.
Steals stuff and hides it.
-- l'll get a trap in the morning.
-
- A humane trap, right?
You know what?
We got a fantastic first day going.
So let's clean up and unpack, cos we got a clambake to go to!
Clambake!
-
- OK, here we go.
What is all this stuff?
-- l'm going as fast as I can.
I should put more sugar in your diets, get you moving.
You actually bought that shirt?
Every dad is entitled to one hideous shirt and one horrible sweater. lt's part of the dad code.
-
- Mark, you're on fireworks detail.
-
- OK.
-
- What's all that?
-
- Nothing.
Seatbelts.
OK, kids.
You know the rules.
I'm underdressed. I thought this was supposed to be a clambake.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
-
- Hey, guys.
So glad you could come.
-
- Hi, Mike.
Good to see you.
Listen.
Kids, food's downstairs.
Mom, Dad, the bar is there.
Have a great time.
-
- Best behaviour.
-
- Stick together.
Keep an eye on them.
-
- Food.
-
- See you later.
-
- Lloyd, how are you?
-
- Good to see you, Jimmy.
There's Jimmy Murtaugh!
Engage me in conversation.
-
- We are talking.
-- l know, but more intense so he won't come.
-
- Just hide your face.
-
- Well, that's a little obvious.
-
- Tom!
-
- Turn.
My goodness.
Look what the wind blew in.
-
- Hey!
-
- Jimmy!
-
- Tom.
Look at you.
-
- How are you?
Wow, you're looking good.
A little wrinkled around the edges, but not bad for an old man.
-
- And you.
-
- Kate.
Kate.
Still looking very hot for a mother of 12.
-
- What brings you guys back to my lake?
-
- Your lake?
Your lake now?
Well, you know, I just have to buy Romanow's place and one or two other properties.
And then I can keep the riff--raff like you outta here.
I'm sorry, honey.
Tom and Kate, this is Sarina, my new bride.
-
- Nice to meet you, Sarina.
-
- Nice to meet you.
The parents of that family of pranksters I told you about.
Jimmy's always been jealous cos we have 12 kids and he only has eight.
A manhood thing.
Well, your 12 never beat my eight for the cup, now, did they, Tom?
-
- Well, no, they didn't.
-- ls that why you came back?
-
- Trying to knock my family off the wall?
-
- No.
We actually just came for a vacation.
-
- Come on.
Buy me a drink.
-
- Buy you a drink?
Mr Lake?
Jake Baker?
Eliot Murtaugh.
No way.
Dude, it's Eliot Murtaugh.
-
- That's Mike.
-
- Hey, Mike.
That's such a cool stick.
Can you bang any tricks?
Yeah.
Check it.
Awesome!
-- l'll have clams, please.
-
- Sorry, there's no clams.
We have some clam fritters.
So this clambake is clamless?
Then why notjust call it a buffet?
-- l feel like a stranger on this planet.
-- l couldn't agree with you more.
So, Tom, I read you quit the head coaching gig at Illinois Poly.
What was that all about?
It took up a lot of hours and I wanted to spend more time with the family.
-
- Kudos.
-
- Thank you.
-
- That's my word for the day.
-
- How fun. lt's fun to have a word.
So, Katie, I guess with Tom at home changing diapers, you're tearing up the bestseller list.
I only had the one book, but I would love to...
Excuse me.
Waiter.
Another Scotch, por favor.
Anybody else?
-- l'm fine.
-
- Hey, what about Charlie?
Still playing ball?
No.
He's living downtown and he's working in a garage to pay tuition to the University of Chicago.
I did a guest spot on Monster Garage back when I was acting.
And I just love the whole engine--and--cars thing.
-
- So you're an actress.
That's great.
-
- Thank you, Tom.
-
- You're welcome, Sarina.
-
- Kudos.
-
- How long have you two been married?
-
- Six amazing months.
-
- Right, honey?
-
- Happy anniversary.
There's Mike, Jake and Sarah.
They compete in skating contests on a regular basis.
-
- See you.
-
- Hey!
Sarah!
That's good.
You gotta start with the small steps before you take the big ones.
-
- Mark Baker?
-
- Kenny the maniac!
Well, if it isn't my partner in crime.
-
- You're gonna get in trouble, Murtaugh.
-
- Only if I get caught, Baker.
Come here. I wanna show you something.
-
- Please don't get me in trouble like last time.
-
- You worry too much.
How are your kids?
I've got three at a private school for gifted children in Lake Forest.
Two at Andover, one at Exeter.
Calvin's at Yale finishing up a field study in particle physics.
Generating a lot of interest.
Eliot was in Sports lllustrated.
Just won the snowboarding junior nationals.
-
- Slope style.
-
- Well, that was no surprise.
But I gotta say, Anne's still my superstar.
When she finishes her MBA at Harvard, she's gonna work for me at Murtaugh Enterprises.
Definitely corporate material.
Something reeks.
Get out of the way!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Look out.
She's gonna blow!
Cool.
Listen, mister, accident or not, you'll be taking the garbage out, or something you don't wanna do, for 30 days.
So sit down, please.
Everyone, quiet.
For me.
Parenting comes down to one word -- "push".
If you don't push, they don't do anything.
-- l think it's a little more complicated.
-- ls it?
"Most went through periods in their life when they worried about making car payments."
-
- Hey!
Gotcha!
-
- Yeah.
Nigel, leave Kyle's pants alone!
Look, no one was hurt. lt's fine.
In fact, why don't you come over to The Boulders sometime?
-
- The Boulders?
-
- Our cottage.
We would love to do that sometime...
Hey, kids, why don't you leave the fireworks at home?
You're all welcome at our place.
We've got Seadoos, lasers, wireless internet, plasma screens, satellite TVs, all the toys and whistles.
You know what?
Actually, we're here for quality time with the kids.
Come on, it's time to go.
We've done enough damage here.
-
- So we'll probably see you on the lake.
-
- Sure.
Another time.
-
- Nice to meet you.
-
- Nice meeting you too.
Good seeing you again, Tom.
You too...
-
- Kate.
-
- Kate.
Boy, you know, when we were kids, I used to be so envious of Tom Baker.
He just had it all.
Well, I guess the Gucci loafer's on the other foot now, isn't it?
-
- Everyone, straight to bed.
-
- What a moron.
-
- He's our son.
-
- Not Mark, he's a kid.
Murtaugh. "Seems like you could use the word 'push'."
Next time we see him, let's agree to ignore him.
-
- There's not gonna be a next time.
-- l don't know if the kids will agree.
You think that water slide could compete with the tyre swing I'm gonna put up?
Rise and shine!
Daylight's burning.
It is breakfast at the Bakers', day one!
Come on, sleepy heads.
is there a particular reason that we're eating breakfast outside?
-
- Cos it's a beautiful day at Lake Winnetka.
-- lt's vacation, sweetheart.
And there's the rest of the clan.
Come on.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, look.
Hey!
Welcome to the land o' plenty.
It still smells the same here.
Like dead leaves, unwashed animals and murky lake water.
-- lt's called fresh air, sweetheart.
-
- Watch the hat.
-
- Hey, guys.
-
- Come on, let's eat.
We're gonna need a forklift to get Lorraine's suitcase outta here.
What have I been here, 30 seconds, and you're already making fun of me?
Yeah, that was my foot.
-- ls that suitcase just for make--up?
-
- Whatever, Butch.
Big breakfast, everybody, so you have enough room for family activities.
-
- Family activities?
-
- Appleschmear.
Fishing for Big Daddy.
The tyre swing, the diving board.
-- l'm boarding.
-
- Kenneth has video games.
We were gonna use the Murtaughs' internet to research for the academic decathlon.
Precisely.
We need the extra hours.
Well, you got all vacation to go over to that place.
We have all vacation to do the family activities too.
Sarah, what about you?
You wanna hang out with Dad?
Actually, I was gonna go boarding with Jake.
And Eliot.
Well, you know, I guess we could do lake stuff another day.
Here we go.
Scones.
Henry.
Jake.
All right.
Leave it there, the dog will get it.
Did you nail down an apartment?
I'm just waiting to hear.
I'll bet you could get a place in Chicago for half the rent.
Dad, I thought we made a deal.
That dock needs work.
-
- Where are you going?
-
- The hardware store. I'll fix this place up.
-
- You got a crazy look.
What are you getting?
-
- Tools!
Honey.
Honey.
OK.
Do not stand up.
Do you hear me?
Dad!
Dad!
Hello?
Dad!
Hey, kids.
Tyre swing ready!
Tyre swing not ready.
-
- Hey, Dad.
-
- Hey.
Get bored over at the Murtaughs'?
No.
We're going back after study time.
You guys are making time for your studies?
I'm really proud of you.
Not us, Dad.
Them.
Mr Murtaugh forces all of the kids to read and write two hours every day.
Lame. I know.
Who are these guys?
-
- What?
-
- There's no way I'm camping out.
Yes, honey.
You can do it one night for Daddy.
Come on.
-
- This doesn't sit well with me.
-- l know what you mean.
Lorraine, are you serious?
is she kidding?
That's not gonna fit in your tent, Lorraine.
I'm gonna make it fit, Dad.
-
- Hey, come on.
We're making s'mores.
-- l'll help you.
Actually, we're trying to eat only organic food.
-
- We're trying to eat only organic food.
-- ls that for the baby?
Come on.
Baby'll love a s'more.
Party in your tummy.
Cool.
The Bakers are having a campout.
Can I go over?
Why have a campout when you can have a full--on fondue party right here?
Sweet.
Charlie, you're worse than a kitten.
Babe, that's your fourth s'more.
My parents never let me have these.
They're amazing.
Do you think we should be more strict with the kids?
No, honey.
We give them love and guidance.
What else is there, really?
Every time we turn around, they're in trouble, about to get into it, or laying out a long--term plan to create it.
Dad, how come those guys know how to camp so good?
-
- Hey.
Hey!
What if we sing a camp song?
-
- OK.
Sounds good.
What do you say we give 'em a run for their money?
Come on.
Stand up.
This guy is so competitive!
Boy, I love camping.
Yeah.
This is fun.
-
- Good times.
Good times.
-
- Good times, yeah.
Hey, kids.
Didn't you love blowing Murtaugh off the lake last night?
Kids?
Honey, they're all in the house.
-
- No.
-
- Yeah.
Hello?
Happy?
They can't spend one night in the tent?
Hey, Tom.
Now, what does that show--off want?
What a day.
Hey, Tom?
Boy, you have got this place looking...
Anyway, I see the troops are sleeping in.
They're already up.
They're out cutting wood and making biscuits and blazing a new trail out back -- nothing out of the ordinary.
Yeah.
Really impressive.
Listen, the missus and I are thinking of putting on a little spread.
Since the kids are getting along so well, why don't you and the gang come to The Boulders for brunch?
-
- Actually, we have to...
-
- Cool, what time?
Mimosas at noon, on the dot.
Yeah!
Attagirl.
Take it away, honey.
Adios, amigo.
-- lsn't he like the coolest dad ever?
-
- Yeah.
Cool.
Whoa, dude!
Awesome, dude.
Kids, you stay right here.
Welcome to The Boulders.
-
- Hey.
Let's say hello.
-
- Hi.
Hey.
Thanks for having us.
Where's the gift shop?
You brought your dog.
-
- Sorry.
Just say "sit".
-
- Down, Gunner.
Tom.
Baker!
Somebody help.
-- l'm fine.
-
- They're called obedience schools, Baker!
-
- Are you all right?
-- l'm fine.
-
- Tie Fido up for five minutes.
-
- Honey, he's fine.
Just let him play.
We don't want that animal near the dining set.
It was a gift from the king of Thailand.
Mark, there's a leash in the car.
Get it.
-
- Why don't we all go inside?
-
- Good idea.
I'll be right back.
Sarah.
You wanna go on the Seadoo with me and Jake before we eat?
Yeah.
Sure.
Cool.
Let's go.
Are you coming or not, dude?
Yeah.
Jimmy.
Almost forgot.
Tom, for heaven's sake.
You didn't have to do this.
-- "Sparkling Cheesehead"?
-
- Wisconsin's finest bubbly.
I'm sure it is.
Might have to let this baby age about two, three hundred years, Tom.
Superstar, do me a favour.
Take this to the cellar and bring a bottle of Taittinger.
-
- Sure.
-- l'll give you a hand.
-- lt's a fantastic place.
-- lt's not much, but I call it a second home.
How come you guys haven't built your own house up here?
With 12 kids, you've gotta use the money for food and water.
I bet if Tom had kept thatjob at Illinois Poly he could have built a place like this.
Well, life's full of choices.
Some good, some not so good.
Honey, why don't you take Kate and show her the dining set the king of Thailand gave us?
-
- OK, honey.
-- l'd love to look at the plates from a king.
-
- Don't get lost, honey.
-
- Tom, I wanna show you something.
Feast your eyes on these honeys, Tom.
Albino ironwood, right out of the Peruvian rainforest.
You can still smell the jungle on 'em.
Go ahead, take a whiff.
Come on.
Rest your honker on the log and take a whiff.
-
- Smells like global warming.
-
- That's moss. lt's moss, Tom.
Well, this is the trophy room.
-
- Are those your kids?
-
- Yeah.
That's the Murtaugh victory reel.
-- lt's on a loop.
-- lt's a good room.
I'll tell you why I love this room so much, Tom.
All the trophies, the ribbons, the prizes -- past, present and future.
It's proof that children can be groomed to reflect the best aspects of any given gene pool.
-
- You just have to keep them on a short leash.
-- l couldn't agree more.
My Anne's proof of that.
You're looking a lot more put together than you did a few years ago.
Thanks.
Remember your nose was too big, and that skin irritation on your hand?
Itjust kept working its way up your arm and into your neck... I'm glad that it's gone, though.
Looks good.
Well, if I remember correctly, you weren't so hot yourself.
That mutt could use a shorter leash too.
She's so cool.
Yeah, the kids and I spent a weekend putting that dock together.
Nothing like a little manual labour to keep you humble.
Sit down, Tom.
So Jimmy has matching pants to that shirt?
Boy, this place wasn't put together overnight.
-
- Does Daddy know about your tattoo?
-
- No.
-- l'm sorry, Mom.
-- l'm so sorry.
It's OK. I'm fine.
-- lt's like spring break.
Hope I win.
-- l've got a shirt you can borrow.
-
- A shirt?
OK.
-
- Mom, I...
-
- Are you OK?
-
- Yeah, I'm fine.
-- lf my dad finds out before I...
-
- You'll get grounded?
Please, just don't say anything.
Nice hands.
-
- Hey, Sarah.
-
- Hey, Dad.
You should see Mr Murtaugh's new Seadoo.
That's terrific.
Now turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Why?
Turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Are you still in touch with your dark gifts?
Punking, practical jokes, soaking underwear and...
-
- Meat.
-
- Yeah.
-
- Classic.
-
- Yeah.
-
- Yeah, I'm in touch.
Why?
-- l have a mission for you.
Who's the target?
Murtaugh.
I can help you.
Hi.
-
- As long as I don't do time for the crime.
-
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Done.
No grounding.
No allowance dockage.
No spiel about the difference between right and wrong.
And you have no problem with the methods that I choose.
It's your contract, do with it what you will.
-
- Agreed?
-
- Agreed.
Hey, give Daddy a hug.
Nail him.
Guys, guys.
Guys!
I have a mission for you.
-- lt's top--secret, and it's high--priority.
-
- Yeah?
What is it?
Come on. I'll show you.
-
- Positions.
-
- Check.
My gosh. it's a purple bigfoot.
-
- What are you talking about?
-
- A purple bigfoot!
-
- A what?
-- l don't see anything.
Made you look, made you look.
-
- Made you look.
-
- You are so stupid.
-
- Did I mention the dining set was a gift...?
-
- The king of Thailand.
Yeah, you did.
-
- Give me that roll.
-- l see your kids can't wait to get started.
Well, that's just the way they are.
Hey, you guys.
No eating until everyone's seated.
-
- Eyes up here, honey.
-
- Doesn't she look hot?
Doesn't hold a candle to you, honey.
Come on, let's sit down.
-
- Where have you been all my life?
-
- All right.
-
- Tom, right over here.
-
- Thank you.
Ignore the place card.
Sit next to your wife.
Fine.
Fine, if you want chaos.
Right here, Tom.
Believe me, I don't mind.
Dad.
Don't...
The seat cushion is soft.
-
- So, you two play tennis?
-
- Yeah.
-
- You're in the meat seat.
-
- What?
I knew that dog was gonna be trouble.
Sit!
My china.
-
- Where is he?
-- l don't know.
You don't know?
It's OK. lt happens all the time.
It doesn't. I'm so sorry. I'm really embarrassed.
Thank you for the lovely shirt.
I insist that you send me a bill for this.
Don't even think about it.
What's a few thousand dollars here or there?
The main thing is you had a good time.
We'll talk about it later.
I'll see you on the tennis court.
Bring your A game.
-
- Bye.
-
- What was that?
-
- Nothing.
-
- That was not nothing.
This was not nothing.
That was something.
All right. ln the house.
I know. I'm a horrible father.
-
- Honey, you broke your promise.
-
- What promise?
That you'd not get involved in this competitive thing.
It's just all so infantile.
-
- He tried to tell us how to raise the kids.
-
- Meaning?
-
- He thinks the kids are...
-
- Did he say it?
No, but you could tell that he implied that's what he thought, that the kids were...
That's right.
"l do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam--l--am."
Aren't you a little old for that book?
-
- She's reading to the baby.
-
- Reading to the baby?
Unborn babies, they're comforted by the sound of their mother's voice.
-
- Just don't spoil my linebacker.
-
- The baby's gonna be what it wants to be.
Just let us be the parents, OK, Dad?
Come on, Bud. I'm hungry.
Yeah.
Me too.
-
- Hi, Mr Baker.
-
- Hi, Eliot.
What's up?
-- l was looking for Sarah.
-
- You mean Jake?
Sarah and I and Calvin, we're going boarding this afternoon.
Well, she'll be back soon.
-
- OK. I'll just wait on the dock.
-
- Wait, wait, wait.
Sit down.
What do you do for a living, Eliot?
-- l'm in eighth grade.
-
- Yeah.
Right.
-
- And how's that going for you?
-
- Fine.
-
- Are you on any teams?
-
- Football, boarding and baseball.
All that focus on sports -- that must impact your grades quite a bit.
No.
Actually, you know, I'm an honours student.
-
- You play any instruments?
-
- Drums.
You're probably in one of those punk bands, right?
Timpani.
You know, school orchestra.
-
- Hey, Eliot.
-
- See you, Mr Baker.
Later, dude...
Dad.
Guys.
-
- What now?
-
- Mind if I go waterboarding with you?
It's kneeboarding, and I'm pretty sure you can't do it.
If Jimmy can do it, I can.
You must be Calvin.
-
- Nice to meet you. I just got back from Yale.
-
- Congratulations.
I'll just squeeze in over here.
There we go.
-- ls everybody ready?
-
- Yeah.
-
- Fun?
-
- Yeah.
Why don't you go first?
Guys, keep an eye on him, all right?
You ready, Mr Baker?
OK, I'm...
-
- Sorry he interrogated you.
-
- My dad would have done the same thing.
-
- Really?
-
- You should come to my house sometime.
He's really easy and likes to keep low--key.
-
- Do you have a favourite subject?
-
- Probably math.
Stop!
You'll do better next time, Mr Baker. it's OK.
-
- Are you sure he'll be OK?
-
- Yeah, he'll be fine.
Dad!
Are you OK?
It's all good.
Well...
I'll go put on a little perfume.
Sarah, Eliot seems OK.
-- l see why you like him.
-
- Somebody's turning red.
Shut up!
Thanks a lot, Dad.
-
- What did I say?
-
- Men can be so clueless.
Honey, men are clueless.
-- l'll go talk to her.
-
- Mom, let me do this, OK?
Trust me, I've got experience in the area of parental harassment.
Hey, I totally know how you feel.
How are you?
Dad can be pretty hands--on, in--your--face sometimes.
Just leave me alone.
A, I'm never trying to help her again.
And B, I cannot wait to move to New York.
-
- What are you doing here?
-
- This is where l run.
What are you doing?
-- l like to get out of the house.
-
- Take a break from the perfect daughter bit?
Hey, I'm not the only one who's putting on an act for Daddy around here.
You've hated the city since we were kids.
-
- Why go to school there?
-
- Seemed like the right thing to do.
Did it seem like the right thing to do because your parents said it was the right thing to do?
No.
My parents wanted me closer to home, that's why.
Are you gonna live at home forever?
I just gotta figure out my next move and do it.
How about you, superstar?
What's the master plan?
Somehow I gotta tell my dad I'm not built for corporate life.
-
- Good luck.
-
- So for now, I'm just gonna draw.
-
- What do you draw?
-
- Stay still, Baker.
Whoa.
Yeah, right.
You're not drawing me, cos l'm gonna...
OK, right here?
is this good?
-- lf l stay here?
It might be better...
-
- Stop smiling.
-
- Sarah, come on.
Hurry up!
-
- OK.
OK.
-
- Has anybody seen my other tennis shoe?
-
- No.
No, I haven't.
-
- Have you seen my other tennis shoe?
-
- No.
Chiseller!
You chiselling little...
Great.
-
- Hey, how are you doing?
-
- Hey, guys.
-
- Good to see you.
-
- Hi.
Nice shoes.
Kidding.
Let's warm up.
OK, let's do it.
-
- Come on, Murtaugh!
-
- Got it.
I don't remember you out here when we were kids.
Dad didn't allow us to come out into the woods.
OK, I'm done.
That's Charlie Baker figuring out his next move.
-
- You're good.
-
- Tell my dad.
Maybe he'll let me transfer to Madison Art School.
-
- You wanna live up here and go to school?
-
- This lake is my favourite place on the planet.
-
- Why?
-- l've always fantasised about moving here.
I don't know, maybe open up a garage or something.
-
- Looks like you figured out your next move.
-- l think you're right.
Wanna go for a walk or something?
-- ls Charlie Baker asking me out on a date?
-- l'm not sure our fathers would approve.
Let's go.
Yours.
Nice.
Nice!
This is mine.
-- lt's these shoes.
-
- OK.
All right.
A poor workman blames his tools, Tom.
-
- Just serve it.
-
- This is payback for the china.
Come on.
Give me your best, Jimmy, give me your best.
-- l got it.
-- l got it.
-- l got it, I got it, I got it.
-- l got it.
Mine.
-
- Got it.
-- l got it.
-
- Mine.
-
- Whoa.
-- lt's turbo.
-- l'm in so much trouble.
There's no way.
-
- Don't be a wimp.
-- l'm not a wimp.
-
- Come on.
Get in.
-
- OK, just one little cruise.
Come on, Baker. I'm getting old here.
Just be careful.
Whoa!
Slow down!
Mr and Mrs Baker, excuse me.
There's a call from security over at the gift shop.
-
- What's this about?
-
- Just follow me.
Slow down!
Stop!
Slow down!
We're willing to let it slide if you promise to keep your kids under control.
I really appreciate that.
We'll take care of it.
-
- There you go.
Thanks, Skippy.
-
- Thank you, Mr Murtaugh.
Are you just gonna talk to her?
How I discipline my kids is none of your business.
You know, I've been trying to say this in a nice way, but...
Well, there's a reason your kids are screw--ups.
My kids screwed up.
They are not screw--ups.
You're not strict enough.
Parenting isn't a popularity contest, Tom, but I guess if you knew that, your kids wouldn't be so undisciplined.
The only problem with my kids is they're hanging out with yours.
It wasn't my daughter who got caught stealing.
It wasn't my son who trashed a tennis court.
Do you actually think I'm screwing up my kids, Baker?
Yeah.
And one day they're gonna crack.
Well, why don't we test that theory?
On Labor Day.
Murtaughs versus Bakers.
For the cup.
You're on.
We'll see you there.
Let's go.
Did you just agree to that competition thing and the cup?
Yeah.
OK, missy, let's go walk and talk.
Now, tell me what this is all about, because it's so not you.
-- l was embarrassed.
-
- Look at me, honey.
Embarrassed about what?
Make--up.
Honey, you know you can come to me any time with anything.
You know that, right?
And I know why you wanted the make--up.
It was for Eliot, right?
Yeah.
I'm just not pretty like Nora or Lorraine.
I thought maybe the make--up would help.
You're beautiful.
I want you to remember something else that's really important.
When you like a boy, never be anybody but yourself.
Eliot liked you without make--up, didn't he?
-
- Do you think he really likes me?
-
- How could he not?
-
- No more felonies.
Deal?
-
- Deal.
Good.
-
- The Labor Day Cup's gonna be a bloodbath.
-
- You got that right.
From now on, no seeing the Murtaughs, no talking to them, no thinking about them.
-
- Can't we compete and still see them?
-
- No.
Right now, I am not a father. I am a coach.
And we're gonna be training twice a day, every day, starting outside in ten minutes.
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks.
Good.
Lorraine, come on.
Push--ups.
One, two.
Now back up to jumping jacks.
-
- Lorraine, come on.
-
- OK.
And toss.
Toss.
-
- Toss.
Toss.
-
- Dad!
-
- Just toss.
-
- Dad, lay off.
-
- Toss!
-- l'm tossing.
No crying.
-
- Step back.
-
- That's it. I can't handle the pressure, Dad!
Eggs cost money.
OK, it's a three--legged race, but run as if you had two!
On your mark, get set, go.
Go.
Let's go.
-
- Your fault!
-
- Hey!
Come on, come on, get in.
Come on.
-
- Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
-
- Dad!
We're not Murtaughs!
Take a deep swing.
Boom, just like that.
Give it a good one.
Come on.
One more.
That's a zero.
I really love having a family dinner where all you can hear is forks hitting the plates.
You know, this could be our last chance together and you're totally ruining it.
I'm glad we're moving to Houston.
And so is iron Mike or Donna Baker Butkus McNulty.
Bulk up.
You're burning a hole in my face.
Tom.
You've gotta stop this whole training camp thing.
This is not some little fence--line squabble.
This is an epic battle between two families.
No.
No, no, honey.
I think this is Tom versus Jimmy.
I'm sorry, General, but you're losing the respect of your troops.
That's dangerous.
Give the kids some space.
Are you asking me to back out?
No, honey. it's just...
Especially with Sarah.
This is her first crush.
Come on.
-
- What, with Eliot?
-
- Yes.
She needs to know that we trust her.
She couldn't come to me and tell me she wanted to wear make--up.
is that the kind of relationship you want her to have with us?
-
- Hey, Sarina.
How are you?
-
- Hi.
Let's run.
Just leave it.
They'll get somebody.
The kids drop stuff all the time and leave me.
-
- Can I ask you a question?
-
- Sure.
-
- How do you manage 12 kids?
-
- With great difficulty.
Trust me.
Good, cos l have no idea what I'm doing.
You've got a lot of fruit.
I'd get some of this refined sugar.
It's great for negotiating purposes or whatever.
Jimmy's gone overboard with this tough love thing.
The kids are miserable and he doesn't even see it.
He and Tom bring out the best in each other.
I'm actually getting a kick out of it.
Very entertaining.
-
- And exhausting.
-
- This is good.
If tonight's good, I'll ask my dad.
So hopefully tonight will work.
OK.
See you.
Not my little girl.
Hey, Dad.
Are you OK?
Yeah. I just need you to help me pace out 25 yards for the egg race, starting here, OK?
There you go.
-
- Yeah.
-
- OK, go ahead.
-
- Hey, Dad, I was...
-
- Those steps are too small.
-
- Those steps...
-
- Can I go to the movies with Eliot tonight?
..are too big.
I guess so.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Nora has to urinate, and a full bladder puts inordinate strain on the embryotic sac...
Kim!
Thank you.
We could just go with "hurry up".
Hurry up!
I need Lorraine.
You get Lorraine, I'll pee outside.
Hey. lt's me.
How's it going?
Eliot asked me out, and I'm kind of new to the dating thing, so...
-
- Are you gonna make me beg?
-- l was thinking about it.
Come on.
Let's start with your make--up.
Lorraine...
-
- Thanks.
-
- Don't worry about it.
-
- Pink?
-
- Come on.
Can't we do, like, a skin colour?
There you go. lt looks good.
Hey, guys.
Guys. I need everybody's attention.
Sarah's about to come downstairs, and she's going on her date tonight.
She looks a little different, so I would really appreciate it if you guys could give her the respect that you never gave me, and not ridicule her style choices before she enters the world of multi--gender interaction.
So go about your little chores and act completely natural.
Lorraine.
I think you're going to do just fine in New York.
Thank you.
Hubba--hubba.
You look very pretty, honey.
You always do.
Thank you.
Well, I'm going to the movies.
Well, sounds good.
Need some money?
No. I have some from lawn mowing.
-
- Limo's here.
-
- There's Mr Murtaugh.
Well, have fun, and I'll pick you up outside the theatre at nine.
Bye.
-
- Bye.
-
- Bye, cutie.
I'll save a spot for you on the varsity.
Have fun.
-
- Cute, isn't she?
-
- Yeah.
Seems like yesterday that was you, missy.
-
- You're not gonna start crying, are you, Dad?
-- l'm a football coach, remember?
-- l like Henrietta.
-
- You are not calling it Henrietta.
All right.
What have we got to eat?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Honey, do you want something to eat?
Tom, do you want something to eat?
No.
You know what?
Actually, I should go get Sarah.
It's 7:30.
The movie just started.
I'm not going directly.
I'm just gonna stop and get gas first.
There's bound to be traffic, cos it's Labor Day weekend.
-
- Sure there is.
-- l'll get going.
And I don't trust those fish clocks.
They're notoriously slow.
I love you, sweetheart.
Thank you.
One, please.
What are you doing here?
If you must know, I'm here to make sure this movie is appropriate for our children.
It's rated G.
Sir, could you please sit down?
-
- What are you doing here so early?
-
- Father of the daughter always arrives early.
-
- Everybody knows that.
-
- Excuse me. ls there a problem here?
-
- He's harassing me.
-
- He's guilty of overparenting.
If you two can't keep it down, I'm going to throw both of you out.
My God.
Look at this.
What?
He's stretching.
-
- He's doing "the move".
-
- What move?
You're sitting in the theatre, you fake a yawn...
Oh, boy, am I tired.
Hand comes over.
Then a little while later, head comes over, giving you extra reach here.
Mom, look at those two down there.
See what I mean?
Sweet Jesus.
-
- Warning number two.
-
- He was showing me "the move".
Do you mind?
-
- You don't know "the move"?
-
- No. I don't know "the move", OK?
And I wasn't a hormone--crazed Romeo when I was a kid. I had self--control.
-- l had social sophistication, like my son.
-
- Be quiet down there!
-
- Your son has hormones like every teenager.
-
- Meaning what?
Meaning on the sophistication scale, he's one step above ape.
-
- Are you calling my son an ape?
-
- He's an ape like every other male teenager.
-
- Take it back.
-- l'm not gonna take it back.
Take it...
Take it back.
-
- Were you gonna poke me?
-
- No, I was not gonna poke you.
-
- You were gonna poke me.
-
- Because you were asking for it.
If I'm asking for it, why don't you give it to me?
-
- You want a poke?
-
- What's going on down there?
-
- Call that a poke?
-- l call that a practice.
-
- Give me your best poke. I want your best.
-
- You're asking for it.
I do.
Yeah.
Hey!
Call somebody.
Somebody help.
-
- Hey, honey, how did it go?
-
- Dad was totally spying on me.
You ruined everything.
There's no way that I'm competing for you in that stupid cup tomorrow.
-- l can't believe you did that.
-
- Really, Dad, that is so Big Brother.
-
- Yeah, let's go.
-
- Come on, Bud, let's put this baby to bed.
Not cool, Dad.
You and Jimmy aren't so different, Dad.
Different styles, yeah, but same result.
Let's go, guys.
Honey.
Honey, we talked about this, didn't we?
The tighter you hang on, the more they're gonna pull away.
Right?
I'll go talk to her.
Well, we're gonna go compete for the cup.
Couldn't get any more volunteers?
You gonna come and watch us kick some hiney?
Well, maybe I will, honey, when I get everybody fed.
I'm sorry.
-
- OK, guys.
Come on, let's go.
-
- Come on, Dad.
And I'm sorry too.
-
- Did Dad go?
-
- Yep.
With Kyle and Nigel.
Hey.
The Chiseller's got my wallet.
-
- Check it out.
-
- Must have an escape hatch.
-
- Look at all this stuff.
-
- That's mine from, like, the '80s.
Careful.
Careful.
Let me see that.
Look at this.
It's our old team flag.
We lost to the Murtaughs by two points.
Yeah, cos Mom fell in the sack race.
Daddy carried me all the way home.
Fond memories.
You know your father.
He wants to be a part of every single one of them.
That's why he's having such a hard time letting go.
But one thing -- no matter what Daddy says, if he's in a good mood or a bad mood, you're his favourite team, right?
And left.
And right.
And left.
And right.
And left...
Bakers.
What gives, Tom?
Couldn't rally your team?
It's all I've got, but it's enough to take you down, Murtaugh.
Are you kidding me?
You'll be lucky to beat the Doobners.
-
- We'll see.
Come on, guys.
-
- We'll see.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th annual Lake Winnetka Labor Day Cup.
Now, we have seven families competing in ten events today.
The family winning the most events will win the cup.
Simple enough.
So let's get to it, all right?
Contestants, here we go.
OK, guys.
Let's do this.
Hey, Dad.
We're here.
Dad!
There's the team.
There's the team.
You can't keep the varsity down.
And I promise never to go on a date with you and Eliot again.
Hey, Murtaugh!
This is our year!
Let's see what you got, Tom.
-
- OK, Murtaughs.
-
- Huddling.
I've been ajerk all week, but that's old news.
-
- Get loose.
Don't let 'em intimidate you.
-
- Yeah!
You each have a special talent.
I want you to use it.
I don't care if we win or lose.
Just do your best.
OK.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop with the nicey--nice.
Here's the game plan.
We'll step on their throats and press until they stop breathing.
-
- Yeah!
-
- Get focused and stay with the game plan.
-
- What would that be?
-
- We don't have a game plan, but...
-
- Chin up.
Charge the mountain!
-
- Exactly!
That's the game plan.
OK, break on three.
One, two, three.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, go.
Come on, go.
Go, go!
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah, Mark!
Come on.
Go!
Go!
Charge it, charge it, charge it!
Good job.
OK.
That's OK.
-
- Bull's--eye!
-
- One for the Bakers!
Come on, Charlie.
-
- That's it.
That's it.
-
- Go!
Go!
Go, superstar.
Yeah!
-
- Gotta be tough, Baker.
Gotta be tough.
-
- What is this?
Out.
-
- Here we go, Tom.
-- l'm OK, Murtaugh.
Look out.
Not your sport?
Go for ajog.
Come on.
Keep up.
Reverse.
Couldn't have asked for a better day.
Look out!
Ouch.
Well, folks, for the first time since 1961, our Labor Day Cup has ended in a tie.
The Miller family will be taking third place.
And to determine second place and our champion, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are going to have a canoe race from here to the State Forest end of the park and back.
And all family members must participate.
Mike, I got a daughter who's due in a week.
She can't do that.
Tom, maybe you can work something out with Jimmy here.
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit, Tom.
Well...
She can't do it, so we're done.
And congratulations.
I'm going, Dad.
You just pissed off a severely hormonal pregnant woman.
Let's do this!
Nora?
-
- Are you sure?
-- l need a life jacket.
-
- Go, Bakers.
-
- Come on, Murtaughs.
-
- Lose those shoes.
They're fancy and new.
-
- What?
Yours are the same.
I'm a mom. I need the height.
Take those off.
Mom.
Mine tie my new outfit in together.
Stay on the north side of the lake.
There's less wind.
-
- Thanks, Murtaugh.
-
- You're welcome, Baker.
Let's go, superstar.
It's supposed to be fun.
-
- You ready?
-
- Ready.
-
- On your marks.
-
- Murtaugh!
-
- Get set.
-
- Murtaugh!
Go, Bakers!
Go, Bakers!
Come on, we'll catch up.
Let's go.
We're gonna win this, Murtaughs!
Come on.
Put some muscle in it, Bakers.
Stroke.
-
- Stroke.
-
- Stroke.
Come on, superstar.
Come on, Kenneth.
-
- Not this time, Murtaugh.
-
- That's what you think.
Stroke, stroke.
I think we're taking on water.
It's me.
My God!
My God!
Nora's waterjust broke.
Jimmy!
-
- Row!
Row!
-
- Jimmy!
-
- Something's wrong, Jimmy.
-
- He's trying to pull a fast one.
Now, paddle.
-- l don't believe it.
-
- What if somebody's hurt?
Honey, we have a substantial lead. lt's a trick.
-
- How can you be sure?
-- l don't wanna lose.
Now, paddle.
Stroke.
OK, everyone, calm down.
-- lf we cut through, the road's not far.
-
- Can you get us there?
-
- Hello.
Nature boy, remember?
-
- Let's go.
-
- Sit tight.
-
- Go faster.
-
- No, Bud.
Stay with Nora.
-
- Row.
Annie, what are you doing?
What are you doing, superstar?
Paddle.
I'm not a superstar, Dad.
I'm just a person who's trying to have her own life.
And this is not my idea of living. lt's yours.
Like my tattoo?
-
- Annie, get back in this boat.
-
- You'll have to win it without me too.
Eliot, don't you dare.
Don't you...
-- l'm outta here.
-
- Kenneth!
-
- Not cool, Dad.
-
- Becky, don't you...
-
- You've gotta lighten up.
-
- Daniel!
-
- We like the Bakers.
-
- Yeah, Dad.
Lisa!
Robin!
OK, that's it.
You know what?
You kids are gonna be cut off if you don't, you know...
No more charge accounts.
Think about that.
-
- What is wrong with you?
-- l want to win!
You don't get it, Sarina. lt's not me.
It's him. lt's Tom.
He was always the popular one.
He was the one everybody liked.
Everybody.
All the girls.
All the parents liked him.
-
- My own father even liked him better.
-
- That was 18 years before I was born.
Get over it.
Look, your kids are trying to tell you something.
And unless you wanna start looking for wife number four, you'd better listen.
Now, paddle.
-
- Watch out.
-
- Are you sure you're OK?
-- 50 cents says it's a girl.
-- l'll take that bet.
-- l'm in.
-
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
-- l'm all right, I'm all right.
-- l got you, I got you!
That's OK. I got my hips to balance me.
How are you feeling?
-
- Cramping a little.
-
- OK, how often?
Just a couple of times so far.
-- l think I'm going to be sick.
-
- Pay attention to her!
is she OK?
Yeah.
She's delivering lakeside, but yeah.
Did you swim all the way here?
-
- Baker, what's going on?
-
- Nora's having her baby.
We need a hospital.
-
- What can I do to help?
-
- You can help with Nora.
-
- Mark's on point.
Right?
-- l know the area really well.
Dad forced me to read topographical maps of this area, for no apparent reason.
Hey, that's my boy.
Lead the way, Kenneth Murtaugh.
My dad has let me have almost every animal in the world, which makes me an expert on scat trails.
-
- That's my boy.
-
- Point us the right way, I'll find a scat trail.
-
- What's "scat"?
-
- Animal poop.
Cool, we're following poop.
OK, I'm a little competitive.
-- l know.
-
- Go!
Go!
-
- Come on, guys.
This way.
-
- There's a road up ahead.
Yeah.
We did it!
Come on, guys, this way.
Come on.
Hurry!
Come on, hurry up!
I'll take it from here. I got it.
My daughter is about to deliver and I need to get her in.
I don't want her to feel any pain.
I want the baby to be healthy.
Get it?
Good.
-- lf l could get you to fill out...
-- l wouldn't mess with her if I were you, OK?
Right.
-
- Wow.
-
- She's having a baby.
Stay calm!
Can we get a chair over here?
!
-
- Get me in a wheelchair.
-- l need a wheelchair, stat!
Get the chair!
-
- My God.
My God.
-
- Good luck.
It must be this way.
That way.
All right.
Family only in the delivery room.
-
- Whoa, whoa!
You're all family?
-
- Yes.
-
- Help me out here.
-- l'm her mother.
-
- Of course.
-
- Kate.
Do your thing.
-
- OK, come on.
Let's go.
-
- Tom, actually, we'd like Lorraine to come.
We want you to be the godmother.
Really?
Whoa!
Having a baby here!
-
- We'll try to get you a linebacker, Tom.
-
- Come on, everybody.
Come on.
This is a hospital.
You guys have to be quiet.
Tom.
You mind if we wait with you?
That'd be great.
They're good kids, Jimmy.
All of 'em.
And you're saying we have nothing to do with it?
They're born hard--wired.
-
- Look what we found.
-
- Check it out.
Hey.
Just be sure and disinfect them.
It's a bedpan, Kenny.
Take it off.
-
- So your kid gets my kid to wear a bedpan...
-- l didn't tell him to do it.
You look in the face of a six--month--old and that's the way they are.
You look like you have something to say.
I'm done with the city, Dad. I'm gonna open up my own garage and I'm moving up here.
And I wanna audit art classes at Madison.
-
- Pardon me?
-
- Dad, I wanna be an artist.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Jimmy.
Although it does sound pretty exciting.
-
- Sweetheart, is this what you really want?
-- l'm sure.
You know, Annie, I was just trying to be a good father.
I know.
-
- What do you think?
-
- Sounds like you got your mind made up.
I do.
You OK with that?
Yeah. I think I am.
Excuse me.
Tom?
You wanna meet your grandson?
Yeah.
You did a good job, honey.
Really good job.
That's a big boy.
Too bad he wasn't there to help us win the cup.
He'll get a chance.
Mike Romanow gave me a deal.
Now we own the big house at the lake.
It'll be nice having you in the neighbourhood, Bud.
You Murtaughs better start cranking out grandkids if you wanna compete.
You guys.
My godchild is trying to snooze.
So, any ideas on names?
I think we're going to go with "Tom".
Cos you taught us that there's no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.
And you're about as good as they get.
Say hi to Grandpa.
Go on.
You're so beautiful.
Tom.
Hey, Tom.
Welcome to family.
Letting go is the hardest thing you can do as a parent.
You have to settle with the past, engage in the present, and believe in the future.
That vacation at Lake Winnetka reminded Tom and me that we're always learning as parents, and that the bond is forever.
Even as the kids grow up and venture out on their own, we'll always be with them and they'll always be with us.
Because life is a voyage that's homeward bound.
is this my normal face?
Hi, Poo--poo.
You want a treat?
Can I redo that?
What are we gonna do?
She'll never walk again, I'll tell you that.

They say that starting a family is an act of optimism.
Well, Tom and I were clearly very, very, very optimistic.
Of course, there are always good times and difficult ones along the way.
And with 12 kids, you learn a lot of lessons.
But the one that you never get used to is that moment when you look your child in the eye..
...and find yourself having to say the most difficult word of all... ..Goodbye
All right, stay together.
There she is.
Sergio Archer.
Look, she's right there.
Robert Armstrong.
Peter Bailey.
Lorraine Baker.
- He's really gotten good.
- Yeah.
Oh my gosh..
Kicking, kicking.
All right, all right.
It is time to toast the graduate.
Lorraine, we are all so proud of you, for keeping your chin up and charging the mountain.
And for being a truly unique and wonderful person.
And for getting that internship at Allure magazine.
Did you know about that?
Even though I'll be trying to convince you staying here is a better choice for your future than moving to dirty, expensive, crime-ridden New York City, but here's to Lorraine.
OK.
My daughter Nora and her husband Bud, you wanna say something?
And our future linebacker.
We go.
Let's go.
First of all, congratulations, Lorraine.
Bud and I hope that our baby will be as cool and accomplished as you.
And second of all, I don't mean to make this toast all about Bud and I,
- but we have some kind of big news.
- You know about this?
I've just been offered the vice-presidency of a new advertising firm.
Hey!
Congratulations.
Yeah!
In Houston.
We're moving in September.
Thank you.
Great.
Wow.
- Does this mean we won't be uncles?
- You'll be uncles no matter where we live.
Maybe they thought it was the best way to break it to us.
- Quite a surprise.
- I'll say.
Can I get a beer and a white wine?
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.
- I feel like I'm losing two daughters now.
- You're not losing us.
I hope you have help, 'cause with no family there and you being a first-time mom...
- You'll be at work all day...
- I'm not gonna be at work all the time.
We're gonna be fine.
And whatever house we get is gonna have a room reserved for you.
At least you're gonna stay for the touch football game.
- We can't.
We have Lamaze.
- This will help your breathing.
We're gonna see you soon.
You're driving, right?
- See you.
- Bye, sweetheart.
There you go, sir.
That's...
They seem so casual and cavalier.
Well, time for me to get my hands dirty.
You're working?
What about the game?
Rematch against the cousins.
I've got student loans to pay off, Dad.
- OK.
See you.
- Be safe, honey.
Did everybody forget touch football was a tradition here?
- Honey, you've got ten other kids to draft.
- I forgot.
- You forgot?
- Lorraine.
- Staying for the game?
- No, didn't Mom tell you?
I'm spending the weekend at Beth's.
I leave in five minutes.
Love you.
Bye.
Hey, guys.
Ready for some touch?
- Mike and I are competing at the skate park.
- I volunteered at the animal shelter.
Nigel, Kyle, football.
All right.
- I'm here, Coach.
- You just made the varsity, little lady.
Come on.
There you go.
Go, go, go!
- I'll block for you.
Here we go.
Go!
- Athletes!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Somehow I thought it'd get easier.
Ten minutes ago, they were all over us.
Now they don't want to be seen with us in public.
- What's that doing here?
- I bet Lorraine was looking through this.
That's sweet.
The cutest.
Look at her.
She looks just like my mom.
A lot of memories.
Summers in Wisconsin.
Swimming.
All of us camping out.
Everyone together.
Isn't that sweet?
That had to be the last time we were there.
What was it?
Three or four years ago?
- Look at Sarah.
No teeth.
- We were one tight unit back then.
Even if we never beat the Murtaughs for the Labor Day Cup.
Look at that.
Jimmy Murtaugh
- Mr Competitive.
He was so desperate to win, he would... he would win.
All the time.
Even when we were kids, this guy was...
All right, honey.
Let's not go there.
You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.
Go back to the lake.
The whole family on vacation, like we used to.
I could call Mike Romanow and see if the house is available.
It's a great idea, but the kids are in summer school and Nora's pregnant.
That's exactly why we should do it, Kate.
We said it.
Life's blazing by.
Let's go back to the lake one last time.
We did have such good times there, honey.
You and I had alone time, which was nice.
There's the proof.
- Hey, Gunner.
- Hey, Gunner.
Let's call Mike Romanow, honey.
Ok Charlie, you're conferencing with all of us and Lorraine.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
- It's Lorraine.
- We have a surprise.
We rented the big house up in Lake Winnetka.
- Winnetka?
That's my middle name.
- And Lake is mine.
And it's where we're gonna spend Labor Day, just like in the old days.
Dad, I'm gonna be very pregnant then.
Yeah.. and I'm gonna be apartment hunting in New York in August.
- I wanna hang out with my friends.
- How come we're named after a house?
Good question.
Your middle name is Winnetka and your middle name is Lake
- 'cause you were conceived there.
- What does "conceived" mean?
- It means Mom and Dad...
- Had a conversation that we'd discuss it later.
Kyle and me will go anyplace that has our name on it.
- Bingo!
Come on.
- Yeah.
I love the lake.
I'm in.
- I guess I can cancel a couple of gigs.
- Bingo!
We agree to participate.
We'll bring the wakeboards and totally dominate.
- OK, we're in.
- All right!
And that leaves Lorraine.
- Come on.
You'll have fun.
- Come on, Lorraine.
Just come.
All right, here's the deal.
I'll go to the lake if Dad stops nagging me about not going to New York.
Deal.
That's a dozen.
We're going to the lake.
- Who cut the cheese?
- Gunner farted.
We'll drive up tomorrow or the next day.
- You missed.
- I love you too.
Bye.
Lorraine's got a line on a place.
She and Charlie will come in a couple of days.
Couple of days?
The whole point of the vacation is that the whole family is together.
Honey, relax.
All right.
Remember this?
Look at the lake.
It looks fantastic.
- Does it look great or what?
- Come on, kids.
All right.
Slide out.
Hurry up.
Everyone out.
Come on.
Let's check the place out.
- Look at it.
- This is it?
- Remember this?
- It looks smaller.
- And more disgusting.
- Yeah.
Why can't we rent that place?
Well, that place is new.
- This place is...
- Older, but still nice.
Yeah.
And that might have a water slide, but our place has...
There's stairs.
They're fun.
So unload, camper dudes!
Girls in the north bunk room, boys in the south.
- Bud and Nora in the loft.
Come on!
- Careful.
Hey, Bud, give the phone a rest.
We're on vacation.
Hey.
How did Mad Dog like the trip?
Maybe the baby's not gonna be a "Mad Dog," Tom.
But that's a classic linebacker name.
OK, how about Dick Butkus McNulty?
- Maybe it's gonna be a girl, Dad.
- Donna Butkus McNulty.
- We got all vacation to pick a name.
- Someone's here.
- Mike Romanow.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Everything OK?
Shouldn't be too disorganized, only two renters this season.
- The lake's a lot more upscale.
- Thank Jimmy Murtaugh.
Remember him?
- Yeah.
- He owns most of the lake now.
That's his place over there.
Well, good for Jimmy.
- Hey, remember Kate?
- Hey, Mike.
How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
So what is if you don't feel like cooking, there's a clambake up at the club.
- You can come as my guests.
- Guests?
Yeah.
Club's private now.
And renovated.
- Homeowners only.
Put you on the list?
- OK.
- What's going on?
- Stop!
The Chiseler.
- Tell me those aren't my keys.
- Get him outside, OK?
- I remember how to handle this guy.
- I can't believe he's still alive.
- You know that thing?
- Hey.
- Don't hurt him.
- I got it.
I got it.
It's a snap.
Here you go.
Hold still.
Yeah.
Leave him alone!
Gunner!
Stay!
Stay, Gunner!
- Get him.
- Gunner, stay!
Mom, watch out!
Don't light the fireworks.
- No explosives in the house!
- Nigel!
Kyle!
Gunner, come back.
- What was that beast?
- The Chiseler?
A pack rat.
Steals stuff and hides it.
- I'll get a trap in the morning.
- A humane trap, right?
You know what?
We got a fantastic first day going.
So let's clean up and unpack, 'cause we got a clambake to go to!
Clambake!
- OK, here we go.
What is all this stuff?
- I'm going as fast as I can.
I should put more sugar in your diets, get you moving.
Oh my god...honey, you actually bought that shirt?
Every dad is entitled to one hideous shirt and one horrible sweater.
It's part of the dad code.
- Mark, you're on fireworks detail.
- OK.
- What's all that?
- Nothing.
Seatbelts.
OK, kids.
You know the rules.
I'm underdressed.
I thought this was supposed to be a clambake.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
- Hey, guys.
So glad you could come.
- Hi, Mike.
Good to see you.
Listen.
Kids, food's downstairs.
Mom, Dad, the bar is there.
Have a great time.
- Best behavior.
- Stick together.
Keep an eye on them.
- Food.
- See you later.
- Lloyd, how are you?
- Good to see you, Jimmy.
There's Jimmy Murtaugh!
Engage me in conversation.
- We are talking.
- I know, but more intense so he won't come.
- Just hide your face.
- Well, that's a little obvious.
- Tom!
- Turn.
Oh..my goodness.
Look what the wind blew in.
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
- Tom.
Look at you.
- How are you?
Wow, you're looking good.
A little wrinkled around the edges, but not bad for an old man.
- And you.
- Kate.
Kate.
Still looking very hot for a mother of 12.
- What brings you guys back to my lake?
- Your lake?
Your lake now?
Well, you know, I just have to buy Romanow's place and one or two other properties.
And then I can keep the riff-raff like you outta here.
I'm sorry, honey.
Tom and Kate, this is Sarina, my new bride.
- Nice to meet you, Sarina.
- Nice to meet you.
This is the parents of that family of pranksters I told you about.
Jimmy's always been jealous 'cause we have 12 kids and he has eight.
A manhood thing.
Well, your 12 never beat my eight for the cup, now, did they, Tom?
- Well, no, they didn't.
- Is that why you came back?
- Trying to knock my family off the wall?
- No.
We actually just came for a vacation.
- Come on.
Buy me a drink.
- Buy you a drink?
Mr Lake?
Jake Baker?
Eliot Murtaugh.
No way.
Dude, it's Eliot Murtaugh.
Hey
- That's Mike.
- Hey, Mike.
That's such a cool stick.
Can you bang any tricks?
Yeah.
Check it.
Awesome!
- I'll have clams, please.
- Sorry, there's no clams.
We have some clam fritters.
So this clambake is clamless?
Then why not just call it a buffet?
- You know.. sometimes I feel like a stranger on this planet.
- I couldn't agree with you more.
So, Tom, I read you quit the head coaching gig at Illinois Poly.
What was that all about?
It took up a lot of hours and I wanted to spend more time with the family.
- Kudos.
- Thank you.
- That's my word for the day.
- How fun.
It's fun to have a word.
So, Katie, I guess with Tom at home changing diapers, you're tearing up the bestseller list.
I only had the one book, but I would love to...
Excuse me.
Waiter.
Another Scotch, por favor.
Anybody else?
- I'm fine.
- Hey, what about Charlie?
Still playing ball?
No.
He's living downtown and he's working in a garage to pay tuition to the University of Chicago.
I did a guest spot on Monster Garage back when I was acting.
And I just love the whole engine-and-cars thing.
- So you're an actress.
That's great.
- Thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome, Sarina.
- Kudos.
- How long have you two been married?
- Six amazing months.
- Right, honey?
- Happy anniversary.
There's Mike, Jake and Sarah.
They compete in skating contests on a regular basis.
- See ya.
- Hey!
Sarah!
That's good.
You gotta start with the small steps before you take the big ones.
- Mark Baker?
- Kenny the maniac!
Well, if it isn't my partner in crime.
- You're gonna get in trouble, Murtaugh.
- Only if I get caught, Baker.
Come here.
I wanna show you something.
- Please don't get me in trouble like last time.
- You worry too much.
And how are your kids?
I've got three at a private school for gifted children in Lake Forest.
Two at Andover, one at Exeter.
Calvin's at Yale finishing up a field study in particle physics.
Generating a lot of interest.
Eliot was in Sports Illustrated.
Just won the snowboarding junior nationals.
- Slope style.
- Well, that was no surprise.
But I gotta say, Anne's still my superstar.
When she finishes her MBA at Harvard, she's gonna work for me at Murtaugh Enterprises.
Definitely corporate material.
Something reeks.
Get out of the way!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Look out.
She's gonna blow!
Cool.
Listen, mister, accident or not, you'll be taking the garbage out, or something you don't wanna do, for 30 days.
So sit down, please.
Everyone, quiet.
For me.
Parenting comes down to one word - "push." If you don't push, they don't do anything.
- I think it's a little more complicated.
- Is it?
"Most went through periods in their life when they worried about making car payments."
- Hey!
Gotcha!
- Yeah.
Nigel, leave Kyle's pants alone!
Look, no one was hurt.
It's fine.
In fact, why don't you come over to The Boulders sometime?
- The Boulders?
- Our cottage.
We would love to do that sometime...
Hey, kids, why don't you leave the fireworks at home?
You're all welcome at our place anytime.
We've got Seadoos, lasers, wireless internet, plasma screens, satellite TVs, all the toys and whistles.
You know what?
Actually, we're here for quality time with the kids.
Come on, it's time to go.
We've done enough damage here.
- So we'll probably see you on the lake.
- Sure.
Another time.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you too.
Good seeing you again, Tom.
You too...
- Kate.
- Kate.
Boy, you know, when we were kids, I used to be so envious of Tom Baker.
He just had it all.
Well, I guess the Gucci loafer's on the other foot now, isn't it?
- Everyone, straight to bed.
- What a moron.
- Honey, he's our son.
- Not Mark, he's a kid.
Murtaugh. "Seems like you could use the word 'push'."
Next time we see him, let's agree to ignore him.
- There's not gonna be a next time.
- I don't know if the kids will agree.
You think that water slide could compete with the tire swing I'm gonna put up?
Rise and shine!
Daylight's burning.
It is breakfast at the Bakers', day one!
Come on, sleepy heads.
Is there a particular reason that we're eating breakfast outside?
- 'Cause it's a beautiful day at Lake Winnetka.
- It's vacation, sweetheart.
And there's the rest of the clan.
Come on.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, look.
Hey!
Welcome to the land o' plenty.
It still smells the same here.
Like dead leaves, unwashed animals and murky lake water.
- It's called fresh air, sweetheart.
- Watch the hat.
- Hey, you guys.
- Come on, let's eat.
We're gonna need a forklift to get Lorraine's suitcase outta here.
What have I been here, 30 seconds, and you're already making fun of me?
Yeah, that was my foot.
- Is that suitcase just for make-up?
- Whatever, Butch.
Big breakfast, everybody, so you have enough room for family activities.
- Family activities?
- Appleschmear.
Fishing for Big Daddy.
Hanging up the tire swing, the diving board.
- I'm boarding.
- Kenneth has video games.
We were gonna use the Murtaughs' internet to research for the academic decathlon.
Precisely.
We need the extra hours.
Well, you got all vacation to go over to that place.
We have all vacation to do the family activities too.
Sarah, what about you?
You wanna hang out with Dad?
Mmm.. actually, I was gonna go boarding with Jake.
And Eliot.
Well, you know, I guess we could do lake stuff another day.
Here we go.
Scones.
Henry.
Jake.
All right.
Leave it there, the dog will get it.
Did you nail down an apartment?
I'm just waiting to hear.
I'll bet you could get a place in Chicago for half the rent.
Dad, I thought we made a deal.
That dock needs work.
- Oh..where are you going?
- The hardware store.
I'll fix this place up.
- You got a crazy look.
What are you getting?
- Tools!
Honey.
Honey.
OK.
Do not stand up.
Do you hear me?
Dad!
Dad!
Hello?
Dad!
Hey, kids.
Tire swing ready!
Tire swing not ready.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.
Get bored over at the Murtaughs'?
No.
We're going back after study time.
You guys are making time for your studies?
I'm really proud of you.
Not us, Dad.
Them.
Mr Murtaugh forces all of the kids to read and write two hours every day.
Lame.
I know.
Who are these guys?
- What?
- There's no way I'm camping out.
Yes, honey.
You can do it one night for Daddy.
Come on.
- This doesn't sit well with me.
- I know what you mean.
Lorraine, are you serious?
Is she kidding?
That's not gonna fit in your tent, Lorraine.
I'm gonna make it fit, Dad.
- Hey, come on.
We're making s'mores.
- I'll help you.
Actually, we're trying to eat only organic food.
- We're trying to eat only organic food.
- Is that for the baby?
Come on.
Baby'll love a s'more.
Party in your tummy.
Cool.
The Bakers are having a campout.
Can I go over?
Why have a campout when you can have a full-on fondue party right here?
Sweet.
Charlie, you're worse than a kitten.
Babe, that's your fourth s'more.
My parents never let me have these.
They're amazing.
Do you think we should be more strict with the kids?
No, honey.
We give them love and guidance.
What else is there, really?
Every time we turn around, they're in trouble, about to get into it, or laying out a long-term plan to create it.
Dad, how come those guys know how to camp so good?
- Hey.
Hey!
What if we sing a camp song?
- OK.
Sounds good.
What do you say we give 'em a run for their money?
Come on.
Stand up.
This guy is so competitive!
Boy, I love camping.
Yeah.
This is fun.
- Good times.
Good times.
- Good times, yeah.
Hey, kids.
Didn't you love blowing Murtaugh off the lake last night?
Kids?
Honey, they're all in the house.
- No.
- Yeah.
Hello?
Happy?
They can't spend one night in the tent?
Hey, Tom.
Now, what does that show-off want?
What a day.
Hey, Tom?
Boy, you have got this place looking...
Anyway, I see the troops are sleeping in.
Oh no..they're already up.
They're out cutting wood and making biscuits and blazing a new trail out back - nothing out of the ordinary.
Yeah.
Really impressive.
Listen, the missus and I are thinking of putting on a little spread.
Okay, since the kids are getting along so well, why don't you and the gang come to The Boulders for brunch?
- Oh you know.. actually, we have to...
- Cool, what time?
Mimosas at noon, on the dot.
Yeah!
Attagirl.
Take it away, honey.
Adios, amigo.
- Isn't he like the coolest dad ever?
- Yeah.
Cool.
Whoa, dude!
Awesome, dude.
Kids, you stay right here.
Welcome to The Boulders.
- Hey.
Let's say hello.
- Hi.
Hey.
Thanks for having us.
Where's the gift shop?
You brought your dog.
- Sorry.
Just say "sit."
- Down, Gunner.
Tom.
Baker!
Somebody help.
- I'm fine.
- They're called obedience schools, Baker!
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Tie Fido up for five minutes.
- Honey, he's fine.
Just let him play.
We don't want that animal near the dining set.
It was a gift from the king of Thailand.
Mark, there's a leash in the car.
Get it.
- Why don't we all go inside?
- Good idea.
I'll be right back.
Sarah.
You wanna go on the Seadoo with me and Jake before we eat?
Yeah.
Sure.
Cool.
Let's go.
Are you coming or not, dude?
Yeah.
Jimmy.
Almost forgot.
Tom, for heaven's sake.
You didn't have to do this.
- "Sparkling Cheesehead"?
- Wisconsin's finest bubbly.
I'm sure it is.
Might have to let this baby age about two, three hundred years, Tom.
Superstar, do me a favor.
Take this to the cellar and bring a bottle of Taittinger.
- Sure.
- I'll give you a hand.
- It's a fantastic place.
- It's not much, but I call it a second home.
How come you guys haven't built your own house up here?
With 12 kids, you've gotta use the money for food and water.
I bet if Tom had kept thatjob at Illinois Poly he could have built a place like this.
Well, life's full of choices.
Some good, some not so good.
Honey, why don't you take Kate and show her the dining set the king of Thailand gave us?
- OK, honey.
- I'd love to look at the plates from a king.
- Don't get lost, honey.
- Tom, I wanna show you something.
Feast your eyes on these honeys, Tom.
Albino ironwood, right out of the Peruvian rainforest.
You can still smell the jungle on 'em.
Go ahead, take a whiff.
Come on.
Rest your honker on the log and take a whiff.
- Smells like global warming.
- That's moss.
It's moss, Tom.
Well, this is the trophy room.
- Are those your kids?
- Yeah.
That's the Murtaugh victory reel.
- It's on a loop.
- It's a good room.
I'll tell you why I love this room so much, Tom.
All the trophies, the ribbons, the prizes - past, present and future.
It's proof that children can be groomed to reflect the best aspects of any given gene pool.
- You just have to keep them on a short leash.
- I couldn't agree more.
My Anne's proof of that.
You're looking a lot more put together than you did a few years ago.
Thanks.
Remember your nose was too big, and that skin irritation on your hand?
It just kept working its way up your arm and into your neck...
I'm glad that it's gone, though.
Looks good.
Well, if I remember correctly, you weren't so hot yourself.
That mutt could use a shorter leash too.
She's so cool.
Yeah, the kids and I spent a weekend putting that dock together.
Nothing like a little manual labor to keep you humble.
Sit down, Tom.
So Jimmy has matching pants to that shirt?
Boy, this place wasn't put together overnight.
- Does Daddy know about your tattoo?
- No.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm so sorry.
It's OK.
I'm fine.
- It's like spring break.
Hope I win.
- I've got a shirt you can borrow.
- A shirt?
OK.
- Mom, I...
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- If my dad finds out before I...
- You'll get grounded?
Please, just don't say anything.
Nice hands.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey, Dad.
You should see Mr Murtaugh's new Seadoo.
That's terrific.
Now turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Why?
Turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Are you still in touch with your dark gifts?
Punking, practical jokes, soaking underwear and...
- Meat.
- Yeah.
- Classic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm in touch.
Why?
- I have a mission for you.
Who's the target?
Murtaugh.
I can help you.
Hi.
- As long as I don't do time for the crime.
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Done.
No grounding.
No allowance dockage.
No spiel about the difference between right and wrong.
And you have no problem with the methods that I choose.
It's your contract, do with it what you will.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Hey, give Daddy a hug.
Nail him.
Guys, guys.
Guys!
I have a mission for you.
- It's top-secret, and it's high-priority.
- Yeah?
What is it?
Come on.
I'll show you.
- Positions.
- Check.
Oh my gosh.
It's a purple bigfoot.
- What are you talking about?
- A purple bigfoot!
- A what?
- I don't see anything.
Ha..ha..made you look, made you look.
- Made you look.
- You are so stupid.
- Did I mention the dining set was a gift?
- The king of Thailand.
Yeah, you did.
- Give me that roll.
- I see your kids can't wait to get started.
Well, that's just the way they are.
Hey, you guys.
No eating until everyone's seated.
- Eyes up here, honey.
- Doesn't she look hot?
Doesn't hold a candle to you, honey.
Come on, let's sit down.
- Where have you been all my life?
- All right.
- Tom, right over here.
- Thank you.
Ignore the place card.
Sit next to your wife.
Fine.
Fine, if you want chaos.
Right here, Tom.
Believe me, I don't mind.
Dad.
Don't...
The seat cushion is soft.
- So, you two play tennis?
- Yeah.
- You're in the meat seat.
- What?
I knew that dog was gonna be trouble.
Sit!
My china.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
It's OK.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't.
I'm so sorry.
I'm really embarrassed.
Thank you for the lovely shirt.
I insist that you send me a bill for this.
Don't even think about it.
What's a few thousand dollars here or there?
The main thing is you had a good time.
We'll talk about it later.
I'll see you on the tennis court.
Bring your A game.
- Bye.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
- That was not nothing.
This was not nothing.
That was something.
All right.
In the house.
I know.
I'm a horrible father.
- Honey, you broke your promise.
- What promise?
That you'd not get involved in this competitive thing.
It's just all so infantile.
- He tried to tell us how to raise the kids.
- Meaning?
- He thinks the kids are...
- Did he say it?
No, but you could tell that he implied that's what he thought, that the kids were...
That's right.
"I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-l-am."
Aren't you a little old for that book?
- She's reading to the baby.
- Reading to the baby?
Unborn babies, they're comforted by the sound of their mother's voice.
- Just don't spoil my linebacker.
- The baby's gonna be what it wants to be.
Just let us be the parents, OK, Dad?
Come on, Bud.
I'm hungry.
Yeah.
Me too.
- Hi, Mr Baker.
- Hi, Eliot.
What's up?
- I was looking for Sarah.
- You mean Jake?
Sarah and I and Calvin, we're going boarding this afternoon.
Well, she'll be back soon.
- OK.
I'll just wait on the dock.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Sit down.
What do you do for a living, Eliot?
- I'm in eighth grade.
- Yeah.
Right.
- And how's that going for you?
- Fine.
- Are you on any teams?
- Football, boarding and baseball.
All that focus on sports - that must impact your grades quite a bit.
No.
Actually, you know, I'm an honors student.
- You play any instruments?
- Drums.
You're probably in one of those punk bands, right?
Timpani.
You know, school orchestra.
- Hey, Eliot.
- See you, Mr Baker.
Later, dude...
Dad.
Guys.
- What now?
- Mind if I go waterboarding with you?
It's kneeboarding, and I'm pretty sure you can't do it.
If Jimmy can do it, I can.
You must be Calvin.
- Nice to meet you.
I just got back from Yale.
- Congratulations.
I'll just squeeze in over here.
There we go.
- Is everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Fun?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go first?
Guys, keep an eye on him, all right?
You ready, Mr Baker?
OK, I'm...
- Sorry he interrogated you.
- My dad would have done the same thing.
- Really?
- You should come to my house sometime.
He's really easy and likes to keep low-key.
- Do you have a favorite subject?
- Probably math.
Stop!
You'll do better next time, Mr Baker.
It's OK.
- Are you sure he'll be OK?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.
Dad!
Are you OK?
It's all good.
Well...
I'll go put on a little perfume.
Sarah, Eliot seems OK.
- I see why you like him.
- Somebody's turning red.
Shut up!
Thanks a lot, Dad.
- What did I say?
- Men can be so clueless.
Honey, men are clueless.
- I'll go talk to her.
- Mom, let me do this, OK?
Trust me, I've got experience in the area of parental harassment.
Hey, I totally know how you feel.
How are you?
Dad can be pretty hands-on, in-your-face sometimes.
Just leave me alone.
A, I'm never trying to help her again.
And B, I cannot wait to move to New York.
- What are you doing here?
- This is where I run.
What are you doing?
- I like to get out of the house.
- Take a break from the perfect daughter bit?
Hey, I'm not the only one who's putting on an act for Daddy around here.
You've hated the city since we were kids.
- Why go to school there?
- Seemed like the right thing to do.
Did it seem like the right thing to do because your parents said it was the right thing to do?
No.
My parents wanted me closer to home, that's why.
Are you gonna live at home forever?
I just gotta figure out my next move and do it.
How about you, superstar?
What's the master plan?
Somehow I gotta tell my dad I'm not built for corporate life.
- Good luck.
- So for now, I'm just gonna draw.
- What do you draw?
- Stay still, Baker.
Whoa.
Yeah, right.
You're not drawing me, 'cause I'm gonna...
Right here?
Is this good?
- If I stay here?
It might be better...
- Stop smiling.
- Sarah, come on.
Hurry up!
- OK.
OK.
- Has anybody seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.
No, I haven't.
- Have you seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.
Chiseler!
You chiseling little...
Great.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, guys.
- Good to see you.
- Hi.
Nice shoes.
Kidding.
Let's warm up.
OK, let's do it.
- Come on, Murtaugh!
- Got it.
I don't remember you out here when we were kids.
Dad didn't allow us to come out into the woods.
OK, I'm done.
That's Charlie Baker figuring out his next move.
- You're good.
- Tell my dad.
Maybe he'll let me transfer to Madison Art School.
- You wanna live up here and go to school?
- This lake is my favorite place on the planet.
- Why?
- I've always fantasized about moving here.
I don't know, maybe open up a garage or something.
- Looks like you figured out your next move.
- I think you're right.
Wanna go for a walk or something?
- Is Charlie Baker asking me out on a date?
- I'm not sure our fathers would approve.
Let's go.
Yours.
Nice.
Nice!
This is mine.
- It's these shoes.
- OK.
All right.
A poor workman blames his tools, Tom.
- Just serve it.
- This is payback for the china.
Come on.
Give me your best, Jimmy, give me your best.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- I got it.
Mine.
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Mine.
- Whoa.
- It's turbo.
- I'm in so much trouble.
There's no way.
- Don't be a wimp.
- I'm not a wimp.
- Come on.
Get in.
- OK, just one little cruise.
Come on, Baker.
I'm getting old here.
Just be careful.
Whoa!
Slow down!
Mr and Mrs Baker, excuse me.
There's a call from security over at the gift shop.
- What's this about?
- Just follow me.
Slow down!
Stop!
Slow down!
We're willing to let it slide if you promise to keep your kids under control.
I really appreciate that.
We'll take care of it.
- There you go.
Thanks, Skippy.
- Thank you, Mr Murtaugh.
Are you just gonna talk to her?
How I discipline my kids is none of your business.
You know, I've been trying to say this in a nice way, but...
Well, there's a reason your kids are screw-ups.
My kids screwed up.
They are not screw-ups.
You're not strict enough.
Parenting isn't a popularity contest, Tom, but I guess if you knew that, your kids wouldn't be so undisciplined.
The only problem with my kids is they're hanging out with yours.
It wasn't my daughter who got caught stealing.
It wasn't my son who trashed a tennis court.
Do you actually think I'm screwing up my kids, Baker?
Yeah.
And one day they're gonna crack.
Well, why don't we test that theory?
On Labor Day.
Murtaughs versus Bakers.
For the cup.
You're on.
We'll see you there.
Let's go.
Did you just agree to that competition thing and the cup?
Yeah.
OK, missy, let's go walk and talk.
Now, tell me what this is all about, because it's so not you.
- I was embarrassed.
- Look at me, honey.
Embarrassed about what?
Make-up.
Honey, you know you can come to me any time with anything.
You know that, right?
And I know why you wanted the make-up.
It was for Eliot, right?
Yeah.
I'm just not pretty like Nora or Lorraine.
I thought maybe the make-up would help.
You're beautiful.
I want you to remember something else that's really important.
When you like a boy, never be anybody but yourself.
Eliot liked you without make-up, didn't he?
- Do you think he really likes me?
- How could he not?
- No more felonies.
Deal?
- Deal.
Good.
- The Labor Day Cup's gonna be a bloodbath.
- You got that right.
From now on, no seeing the Murtaughs, no talking to them, no thinking about them.
- Can't we compete and still see them?
- No.
Right now, I am not a father.
I am a coach.
And we're gonna be training twice a day, every day, starting outside in ten minutes.
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks.
Good.
Lorraine, come on.
Push-ups.
One, two.
Now back up to jumping jacks.
- Lorraine, come on.
- OK.
And toss.
Toss.
- Toss.
Toss.
- Dad!
- Just toss.
- Dad, lay off.
- Toss!
- I'm tossing.
No crying.
- Step back.
- That's it.
I can't handle the pressure, Dad!
Eggs cost money.
OK, it's a three-legged race, but run as if you had two!
On your mark, get set, go.
Go.
Let's go.
- Your fault!
- Hey!
Come on, come on, get in.
Come on.
- Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
- Dad!
We're not Murtaughs!
Take a deep swing.
Boom, just like that.
Give it a good one.
Come on.
One more.
That's a zero.
I really love having a family dinner where all you can hear is forks hitting the plates.
You know, this could be our last chance together and you're totally ruining it.
I'm glad we're moving to Houston.
And so is Iron Mike or Donna Baker Butkus McNulty.
Bulk up.
You're burning a hole in my face.
Tom.
You've gotta stop this whole training camp thing.
This is not some little fence-line squabble.
This is an epic battle between two families.
No.
No, no, honey.
I think this is Tom versus Jimmy.
I'm sorry, General, but you're losing the respect of your troops.
That's dangerous.
Give the kids some space.
Are you asking me to back out?
No, honey.
It's just...
Especially with Sarah.
This is her first crush.
Come on.
- What, with Eliot?
- Yes.
She needs to know that we trust her.
She couldn't come to me and tell me she wanted to wear make-up.
Is that the kind of relationship you want her to have with us?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Hi.
Let's run.
Just leave it.
They'll get somebody.
The kids drop stuff all the time and leave me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
- How do you manage 12 kids?
- With great difficulty.
Trust me.
Good, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.
You've got a lot of fruit.
I'd get some of this refined sugar.
It's great for negotiating purposes or whatever.
Jimmy's gone overboard with this tough love thing.
The kids are miserable and he doesn't even see it.
He and Tom bring out the best in each other.
I'm actually getting a kick out of it.
Very entertaining.
- And exhausting.
- This is good.
If tonight's good, I'll ask my dad.
So hopefully tonight will work.
OK.
See you.
Not my little girl.
Hey, Dad.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I just need you to help me pace out 25 yards for the egg race, starting here, OK?
There you go.
- Yeah.
- OK, go ahead.
- Hey, Dad, I was...
- Those steps are too small.
- Those steps...
- Can I go to the movies with Eliot tonight?
...are too big.
I guess so.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Nora has to urinate, and a full bladder puts inordinate strain on the embryotic sac...
Kim!
Thank you.
We could just go with "hurry up."
Hurry up!
I need Lorraine.
You get Lorraine, I'll pee outside.
Hey.
It's me.
How's it going?
Eliot asked me out, and I'm kind of new to the dating thing, so...
- Are you gonna make me beg?
- I was thinking about it.
Come on.
Let's start with your make-up.
Lorraine...
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.
- Pink?
- Come on.
Can't we do, like, a skin color?
There you go.
It looks good.
Hey, guys.
Guys.
I need everybody's attention.
Sarah's about to come downstairs, and she's going on her date tonight.
She looks a little different, so I would really appreciate it if you guys could give her the respect that you never gave me, and not ridicule her style choices before she enters the world of multi-gender interaction.
So go about your little chores and act completely natural.
Lorraine.
I think you're going to do just fine in New York.
Thank you.
Hubba-hubba.
You look very pretty, honey.
You always do.
Thank you.
Well, I'm going to the movies.
Well, sounds good.
Need some money?
No.
I have some from lawn mowing.
- Limo's here.
- There's Mr Murtaugh.
Well, have fun, and I'll pick you up outside the theater at nine.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye, cutie.
I'll save a spot for you on the varsity.
Have fun.
- Cute, isn't she?
- Yeah.
Seems like yesterday that was you, missy.
- You're not gonna start crying, are you, Dad?
- I'm a football coach, remember?
- I like Henrietta.
- You are not calling it Henrietta.
All right.
What have we got to eat?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Honey, do you want something to eat?
Tom, do you want something to eat?
No.
You know what?
Actually, I should go get Sarah.
It's 7:30.
The movie just started.
I'm not going directly.
I'm just gonna stop and get gas first.
There's bound to be traffic, 'cause it's Labor Day weekend.
- Sure there is.
- I'll get going.
And I don't trust those fish clocks.
They're notoriously slow.
I love you, sweetheart.
Thank you.
One, please.
What are you doing here?
If you must know, I'm here to make sure this movie is appropriate for our children.
It's rated G.
Sir, could you please sit down?
- What are you doing here so early?
- Father of the daughter always arrives early.
- Everybody knows that.
- Excuse me.
Is there a problem here?
- He's harassing me.
- He's guilty of overparenting.
If you two can't keep it down, I'm going to throw both of you out.
My God.
Look at this.
What?
He's stretching.
- He's doing "the move."
- What move?
You're sitting in the theater, you fake a yawn...
Oh, boy, am I tired.
Hand comes over.
Then a little while later, head comes over, giving you extra reach here.
Mom, look at those two down there.
See what I mean?
Sweet Jesus.
- Warning number two.
- He was showing me "the move."
Do you mind?
- You don't know "the move"?
- No.
I don't know "the move," OK?
And I wasn't a hormone-crazed Romeo when I was a kid.
I had self-control.
- I had social sophistication, like my son.
- Be quiet down there!
- Your son has hormones like every teenager.
- Meaning what?
Meaning on the sophistication scale, he's one step above ape.
- Are you calling my son an ape?
- He's an ape like every other male teenager.
- Take it back.
- I'm not gonna take it back.
Take it...
Take it back.
- Were you gonna poke me?
- No, I was not gonna poke you.
- You were gonna poke me.
- Because you were asking for it.
If I'm asking for it, why don't you give it to me?
- You want a poke?
- What's going on down there?
- Call that a poke?
- I call that a practice.
- Give me your best poke.
I want your best.
- You're asking for it.
I do.
Yeah.
Hey!
Call somebody.
Somebody help.
- Hey, honey, how did it go?
- Dad was totally spying on me.
You ruined everything.
There's no way that I'm competing for you in that stupid cup tomorrow.
- I can't believe you did that.
- Really, Dad, that is so Big Brother.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on, Bud, let's put this baby to bed.
Not cool, Dad.
You and Jimmy aren't so different, Dad.
Different styles, yeah, but same result.
Let's go, guys.
Honey.
Honey, we talked about this, didn't we?
The tighter you hang on, the more they're gonna pull away.
Right?
I'll go talk to her.
Well, we're gonna go compete for the cup.
Couldn't get any more volunteers?
You gonna come and watch us kick some hiney?
Well, maybe I will, honey, when I get everybody fed.
I'm sorry.
- OK, guys.
Come on, let's go.
- Come on, Dad.
And I'm sorry too.
- Did Dad go?
- Yep.
With Kyle and Nigel.
Hey.
The Chiseler's got my wallet.
- Check it out.
- Must have an escape hatch.
- Look at all this stuff.
- That's mine from, like, the '80s.
Careful.
Careful.
Let me see that.
Look at this.
It's our old team flag.
We lost to the Murtaughs by two points.
Yeah, 'cause Mom fell in the sack race.
Daddy carried me all the way home.
Fond memories.
You know your father.
He wants to be a part of every single one of them.
That's why he's having such a hard time letting go.
But one thing - no matter what Daddy says, if he's in a good mood or a bad mood, you're his favorite team, right?
And left.
And right.
And left.
And right.
And left...
Bakers.
What gives, Tom?
Couldn't rally your team?
It's all I've got, but it's enough to take you down, Murtaugh.
Are you kidding me?
You'll be lucky to beat the Doobners.
- We'll see.
Come on, guys.
- We'll see.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th annual Lake Winnetka Labor Day Cup.
Now, we have seven families competing in ten events today.
The family winning the most events will win the cup.
Simple enough.
So let's get to it, all right?
Contestants, here we go.
OK, guys.
Let's do this.
Hey, Dad.
We're here.
Dad!
There's the team.
There's the team.
You can't keep the varsity down.
And I promise never to go on a date with you and Eliot again.
Hey, Murtaugh!
This is our year!
Let's see what you got, Tom.
- OK, Murtaughs.
- Huddling.
I've been ajerk all week, but that's old news.
- Get loose.
Don't let 'em intimidate you.
- Yeah!
You each have a special talent.
I want you to use it.
I don't care if we win or lose.
Just do your best.
OK.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop with the nicey-nice.
Here's the game plan.
We'll step on their throats and press until they stop breathing.
- Yeah!
- Get focused and stay with the game plan.
- What would that be?
- We don't have a game plan, but...
- Chin up.
Charge the mountain!
- Exactly!
That's the game plan.
OK, break on three.
One, two, three.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, go.
Come on, go.
Go, go!
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah, Mark!
Come on.
Go!
Go!
Charge it, charge it, charge it!
Good job.
OK.
That's OK.
- Bull's-eye!
- One for the Bakers!
Come on, Charlie.
- That's it.
That's it.
- Go!
Go!
Go, superstar.
Yeah!
- Gotta be tough, Baker.
Gotta be tough.
- What is this?
Out.
- Here we go, Tom.
- I'm OK, Murtaugh.
Look out.
Not your sport?
Go for ajog.
Come on.
Keep up.
Reverse.
Couldn't have asked for a better day.
Look out!
Ouch.
Well, folks, for the first time since 1961, our Labor Day Cup has ended in a tie.
The Miller family will be taking third place.
And to determine second place and our champion, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are going to have a canoe race from here to the State Forest end of the park and back.
And all family members must participate.
Mike, I got a daughter who's due in a week.
She can't do that.
Tom, maybe you can work something out with Jimmy here.
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit, Tom.
Well...
She can't do it, so we're done.
And congratulations.
I'm going, Dad.
You just pissed off a severely hormonal pregnant woman.
Let's do this!
Nora?
- Are you sure?
- I need a life jacket.
- Go, Bakers.
- Come on, Murtaughs.
- Laurien, lose those shoes.
They're fancy and new.
- What?
Yours are the same.
I'm a mom.
I need the height.
Take those off.
Mom.
Mine tie my new outfit in together.
Stay on the north side of the lake.
There's less wind.
- Thanks, Murtaugh.
- You're welcome, Baker.
Let's go, superstar.
It's supposed to be fun.
- You ready?
- Ready.
- On your marks.
- Murtaugh!
- Get set.
- Murtaugh!
Go, Bakers!
Go, Bakers!
Come on, we'll catch up.
Let's go.
We're gonna win this, Murtaughs!
Come on.
Put some muscle in it, Bakers.
Stroke.
- Stroke.
- Stroke.
Come on, superstar.
Come on, Kenneth.
- Not this time, Murtaugh.
- That's what you think.
Stroke, stroke.
I think we're taking on water.
It's me.
My God!
My God!
Nora's waterjust broke.
Jimmy!
- Row!
Row!
- Jimmy!
- Something's wrong, Jimmy.
- He's trying to pull a fast one.
Now, paddle.
- I don't believe it.
- What if somebody's hurt?
Honey, we have a substantial lead.
It's a trick.
- How can you be sure?
- I don't wanna lose.
Now, paddle.
Stroke.
OK, everyone, calm down.
- If we cut through, the road's not far.
- Can you get us there?
- Hello.
Nature boy, remember?
- Let's go.
- Sit tight.
- Go faster.
- No, Bud.
Stay with Nora.
- Row.
Annie, what are you doing?
What are you doing, superstar?
Paddle.
I'm not a superstar, Dad.
I'm just a person who's trying to have her own life.
And this is not my idea of living.
It's yours.
Like my tattoo?
- Annie, get back in this boat.
- You'll have to win it without me too.
Eliot, don't you dare.
Don't you...
- I'm outta here.
- Kenneth!
- Not cool, Dad.
- Becky, don't you...
- You've gotta lighten up.
- Daniel!
- We like the Bakers.
- Yeah, Dad.
Lisa!
Robin!
OK, that's it.
You know what?
You kids are gonna be cut off if you don't, you know...
No more charge accounts.
Think about that.
- What is wrong with you?
- I want to win!
You don't get it, Sarina.
It's not me.
It's him.
It's Tom.
He was always the popular one.
He was the one everybody liked.
Everybody.
All the girls.
All the parents liked him.
- My own father even liked him better.
- That was 18 years before I was born.
Get over it.
Look, your kids are trying to tell you something.
And unless you wanna start looking for wife number four, you'd better listen.
Now, paddle.
- Watch out.
- Are you sure you're OK?
- 50 cents says it's a girl.
- I'll take that bet.
- I'm in.
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- I'm all right, I'm all right.
- I got you, I got you!
That's OK.
I got my hips to balance me.
How are you feeling?
- Cramping a little.
- OK, how often?
Just a couple of times so far.
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- Pay attention to her!
Is she OK?
Yeah.
She's delivering lakeside, but yeah.
Did you swim all the way here?
- Baker, what's going on?
- Nora's having her baby.
We need a hospital.
- What can I do to help?
- You can help with Nora.
- Mark's on point.
Right?
- I know the area really well.
Dad forced me to read topographical maps of this area, for no apparent reason.
Hey, that's my boy.
Lead the way, Kenneth Murtaugh.
My dad has let me have almost every animal in the world, which makes me an expert on scat trails.
- That's my boy.
- Point us the right way, I'll find a scat trail.
- What's "scat"?
- Animal poop.
Cool, we're following poop.
OK, I'm a little competitive.
- I know.
- Go!
Go!
- Come on, guys.
This way.
- There's a road up ahead.
Yeah.
We did it!
Come on, guys, this way.
Come on.
Hurry!
Come on, hurry up!
I'll take it from here.
I got it.
My daughter is about to deliver and I need to get her in.
I don't want her to feel any pain.
I want the baby to be healthy.
Get it?
Good.
- If I could get you to fill out...
- I wouldn't mess with her if I were you, OK?
Right.
- Wow.
- She's having a baby.
Stay calm!
Can we get a chair over here?
!
- Get me in a wheelchair.
- I need a wheelchair, stat!
Get the chair!
- My God.
My God.
- Good luck.
It must be this way.
That way.
All right.
Family only in the delivery room.
- Whoa, whoa!
You're all family?
- Yes.
- Help me out here.
- I'm her mother.
- Of course.
- Kate.
Do your thing.
- OK, come on.
Let's go.
- Tom, actually, we'd like Lorraine to come.
We want you to be the godmother.
Really?
Whoa!
Having a baby here!
- We'll try to get you a linebacker, Tom.
- Come on, everybody.
Come on.
This is a hospital.
You guys have to be quiet.
Tom.
You mind if we wait with you?
That'd be great.
They're good kids, Jimmy.
All of 'em.
And you're saying we have nothing to do with it?
They're born hard-wired.
- Look what we found.
- Check it out.
Hey.
Just be sure and disinfect them.
It's a bedpan, Kenny.
Take it off.
- So your kid gets my kid to wear a bedpan...
- I didn't tell him to do it.
You look in the face of a six-month-old and that's the way they are.
You look like you have something to say.
I'm done with the city, Dad.
I'm gonna open up my own garage and I'm moving up here.
And I wanna audit art classes at Madison.
- Pardon me?
- Dad, I wanna be an artist.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Jimmy.
Although it does sound pretty exciting.
- Sweetheart, is this what you really want?
- I'm sure.
You know, Annie, I was just trying to be a good father.
I know.
- What do you think?
- Sounds like you got your mind made up.
I do.
You OK with that?
Yeah.
I think I am.
Excuse me.
Tom?
You wanna meet your grandson?
Yeah.
You did a good job, honey.
Really good job.
That's a big boy.
Too bad he wasn't there to help us win the cup.
He'll get a chance.
Mike Romanow gave me a deal.
Now we own the big house at the lake.
It'll be nice having you in the neighborhood, Bud.
You Murtaughs better start cranking out grandkids if you wanna compete.
You guys.
My godchild is trying to snooze.
So, any ideas on names?
I think we're going to go with "Tom."
'Cause you taught us that there's no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.
And you're about as good as they get.
Say hi to Grandpa.
Go on.
You're so beautiful.
Tom.
Hey, Tom.
Welcome to family.
Letting go is the hardest thing you can do as a parent.
You have to settle with the past, engage in the present, and believe in the future.
That vacation at Lake Winnetka reminded Tom and me that we're always learning as parents, and that the bond is forever.
Even as the kids grow up and venture out on their own, we'll always be with them and they'll always be with us.
Because life is a voyage that's homeward bound.
Is this my normal face?
Hi, Poo-poo.
You want a treat?
Can I redo that?
What are we gonna do?
She'll never walk again, I'll tell you that.
They say that starting a family is an act of optimism.
Well, Tom and I were clearly very, very, very optimistic.
There are always good times and difficult ones along the way.
And with 12 kids, you learn a lot of lessons.
But the one that you never get used to is that moment when you look your child in the eye and find yourself having to say the most difficult word of all:
Goodbye.
All right, stay together.
There she is.
Sergio Archer.
Look, she's right there.
Robert Armstrong.
Peter Bailey.
Lorraine Baker.
- He's really gotten good.
- Yeah.
My gosh.
Kicking, kicking.
All right, all right.
It is time to toast the graduate.
Lorraine, we are all so proud of you, for keeping your chin up and charging the mountain.
And for being a truly unique and wonderful person.
And for getting that internship at Allure magazine.
Did you know about that?
Even though I'll be trying to convince you staying here is a better choice for your future than moving to dirty, expensive, crime-ridden New York City, but here's to Lorraine.
OK.
My daughter Nora and her husband Bud, you wanna say something?
And our future linebacker.
We go.
Let's go.
First of all, congratulations, Lorraine.
Bud and I hope that our baby will be as cool and accomplished as you.
And second of all, I don't mean to make this toast all about Bud and I,
- but we have some kind of big news.
- You know about this?
I've just been offered the vice-presidency of a new advertising firm.
Hey!
Congratulations.
Yeah!
In Houston.
We're moving in September.
Thank you.
Great.
Wow.
- Does this mean we won't be uncles?
- You'll be uncles no matter where we live.
Maybe they thought it was the best way to break it to us.
- Quite a surprise.
- I'll say.
Can I get a beer and a white wine?
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.
- I feel like I'm losing two daughters now.
- You're not losing us.
I hope you have help, 'cause with no family there and you being a first-time mom...
- You'll be at work all day...
- I'm not gonna be at work all the time.
We're gonna be fine.
And whatever house we get is gonna have a room reserved for you.
At least you're gonna stay for the touch football game.
- We can't.
We have Lamaze.
- This will help your breathing.
We're gonna see you soon.
You're driving, right?
- See you.
- Bye, sweetheart.
There you go, sir.
That's...
They seem so casual and cavalier.
Well, time for me to get my hands dirty.
You're working?
What about the game?
Rematch against the cousins.
I've got student loans to pay off, Dad.
- OK.
See you.
- Be safe, honey.
Did everybody forget touch football was a tradition here?
- Honey, you've got ten other kids to draft.
- I forgot.
- You forgot?
- Lorraine.
- Staying for the game?
- No, didn't Mom tell you?
I'm spending the weekend at Beth's.
I leave in five minutes.
Love you.
Bye.
Hey, guys.
Ready for some touch?
- Mike and I are competing at the skate park.
- I volunteered at the animal shelter.
Nigel, Kyle, football.
All right.
- I'm here, Coach.
- You just made the varsity, little lady.
Come on.
There you go.
Go, go, go!
- I'll block for you.
Here we go.
Go!
- Athletes!
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Somehow I thought it'd get easier.
Ten minutes ago, they were all over us.
Now they don't want to be seen with us in public.
- What's that doing here?
- I bet Lorraine was looking through this.
That's sweet.
The cutest.
Look at her.
She looks just like my mom.
A lot of memories.
Summers in Wisconsin.
Swimming.
All of us camping out.
Everyone together.
Isn't that sweet?
That had to be the last time we were there.
What was it?
Three or four years ago?
- Look at Sarah.
No teeth.
- We were one tight unit back then.
Even if we never beat the Murtaughs for the Labor Day Cup.
Look at that.
Jimmy Murtaugh
- Mr Competitive.
He was so desperate to win, he would... he would win.
All the time.
Even when we were kids, this guy was...
All right, honey.
Let's not go there.
You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.
Go back to the lake.
The whole family on vacation, like we used to.
I could call Mike Romanow and see if the house is available.
It's a great idea, but the kids are in summer school and Nora's pregnant.
That's exactly why we should do it, Kate.
We said it.
Life's blazing by.
Let's go back to the lake one last time.
We did have such good times there, honey.
You and I had alone time, which was nice.
There's the proof.
- Hey, Gunner.
- Hey, Gunner.
Let's call Mike Romanow, honey.
You're conferencing with all of us and Lorraine.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
- It's Lorraine.
- We have a surprise.
We rented the big house up in Lake Winnetka.
- Winnetka?
That's my middle name.
- And Lake is mine.
And it's where we're gonna spend Labor Day, just like in the old days.
Dad, I'm gonna be very pregnant then.
And I'm gonna be apartment hunting in New York in August.
- I wanna hang out with my friends.
- How come we're named after a house?
Good question.
Your middle name is Winnetka and your middle name is Lake
- 'cause you were conceived there.
- What does "conceived" mean?
- It means Mom and Dad...
- Had a conversation that we'd discuss it later.
Kyle and me will go anyplace that has our name on it.
- Bingo!
Come on.
- Yeah.
I love the lake.
I'm in.
- I guess I can cancel a couple of gigs.
- Bingo!
- OK, we're in.
- All right.
We agree to participate.
We'll bring the wakeboards and totally dominate.
- OK, we're in.
- All right!
And that leaves Lorraine.
- Come on.
You'll have fun.
- Come on, Lorraine.
Just come.
All right, here's the deal.
I'll go to the lake if Dad stops nagging me about not going to New York.
Deal.
That's a dozen.
We're going to the lake.
- Who cut the cheese?
- Gunner farted.
We'll drive up tomorrow or the next day.
- You missed.
- I love you too.
Bye.
Lorraine's got a line on a place.
She and Charlie will come in a couple of days.
Couple of days?
The whole point of the vacation is that the whole family is together.
Honey, relax.
All right.
Remember this?
Look at the lake.
It looks fantastic.
- Does it look great or what?
- Come on, kids.
All right.
Slide out.
Hurry up.
Everyone out.
Come on.
Let's check the place out.
- Look at it.
- This is it?
- Remember this?
- It looks smaller.
- And more disgusting.
- Yeah.
Why can't we rent that place?
Well, that place is new.
- This place is...
- Older, but still nice.
Yeah.
And that might have a water slide, but our place has...
There's stairs.
They're fun.
So unload, camper dudes!
Girls in the north bunk room, boys in the south.
- Bud and Nora in the loft.
Come on!
- Careful.
Hey, Bud, give the phone a rest.
We're on vacation.
Hey.
How did Mad Dog like the trip?
Maybe the baby's not gonna be a "Mad Dog," Tom.
But that's a classic linebacker name.
OK, how about Dick Butkus McNulty?
- Maybe it's gonna be a girl, Dad.
- Donna Butkus McNulty.
- We got all vacation to pick a name.
- Someone's here.
- Mike Romanow.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
Everything OK?
Shouldn't be too disorganized, only two renters this season.
- The lake's a lot more upscale.
- Thank Jimmy Murtaugh.
Remember him?
- Yeah.
- He owns most of the lake now.
That's his place over there.
Well, good for Jimmy.
- Hey, remember Kate?
- Hey, Mike.
How are you?
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
If you don't feel like cooking, there's a clambake up at the club.
- You can come as my guests.
- Guests?
Yeah.
Club's private now.
And renovated.
- Homeowners only.
Put you on the list?
- OK.
- What's going on?
- Stop!
The Chiseler.
- Tell me those aren't my keys.
- Get him outside, OK?
- I remember how to handle this guy.
- I can't believe he's still alive.
- You know that thing?
- Hey.
- Don't hurt him.
- I got it.
I got it.
It's a snap.
Here you go.
Hold still.
Yeah.
Leave him alone!
Gunner!
Stay!
Stay, Gunner!
- Get him.
- Gunner, stay!
Mom, watch out!
Don't light the fireworks.
- No explosives in the house!
- Nigel!
Kyle!
Gunner, come back.
- What was that beast?
- The Chiseler?
A pack rat.
Steals stuff and hides it.
- I'll get a trap in the morning.
- A humane trap, right?
You know what?
We got a fantastic first day going.
So let's clean up and unpack, 'cause we got a clambake to go to!
Clambake!
- OK, here we go.
What is all this stuff?
- I'm going as fast as I can.
I should put more sugar in your diets, get you moving.
You actually bought that shirt?
Every dad is entitled to one hideous shirt and one horrible sweater.
It's part of the dad code.
- Mark, you're on fireworks detail.
- OK.
- What's all that?
- Nothing.
Seatbelts.
OK, kids.
You know the rules.
I'm underdressed.
I thought this was supposed to be a clambake.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
- Hey, guys.
So glad you could come.
- Hi, Mike.
Good to see you.
Listen.
Kids, food's downstairs.
Mom, Dad, the bar is there.
Have a great time.
- Best behavior.
- Stick together.
Keep an eye on them.
- Food.
- See you later.
- Lloyd, how are you?
- Good to see you, Jimmy.
There's Jimmy Murtaugh!
Engage me in conversation.
- We are talking.
- I know, but more intense so he won't come.
- Just hide your face.
- Well, that's a little obvious.
- Tom!
- Turn.
My goodness.
Look what the wind blew in.
- Hey!
- Jimmy!
- Tom.
Look at you.
- How are you?
Wow, you're looking good.
A little wrinkled around the edges, but not bad for an old man.
- And you.
- Kate.
Kate.
Still looking very hot for a mother of 12.
- What brings you guys back to my lake?
- Your lake?
Your lake now?
Well, you know, I just have to buy Romanow's place and one or two other properties.
And then I can keep the riff-raff like you outta here.
I'm sorry, honey.
Tom and Kate, this is Sarina, my new bride.
- Nice to meet you, Sarina.
- Nice to meet you.
The parents of that family of pranksters I told you about.
Jimmy's always been jealous 'cause we have 12 kids and he has eight.
A manhood thing.
Well, your 12 never beat my eight for the cup, now, did they, Tom?
- Well, no, they didn't.
- Is that why you came back?
- Trying to knock my family off the wall?
- No.
We actually just came for a vacation.
- Come on.
Buy me a drink.
- Buy you a drink?
Mr Lake?
Jake Baker?
Eliot Murtaugh.
No way.
Dude, it's Eliot Murtaugh.
- That's Mike.
- Hey, Mike.
That's such a cool stick.
Can you bang any tricks?
Yeah.
Check it.
Awesome!
- I'll have clams, please.
- Sorry, there's no clams.
We have some clam fritters.
So this clambake is clamless?
Then why notjust call it a buffet?
- I feel like a stranger on this planet.
- I couldn't agree with you more.
So, Tom, I read you quit the head coaching gig at Illinois Poly.
What was that all about?
It took up a lot of hours and I wanted to spend more time with the family.
- Kudos.
- Thank you.
- That's my word for the day.
- How fun.
It's fun to have a word.
So, Katie, I guess with Tom at home changing diapers, you're tearing up the bestseller list.
I only had the one book, but I would love to...
Excuse me.
Waiter.
Another Scotch, por favor.
Anybody else?
- I'm fine.
- Hey, what about Charlie?
Still playing ball?
No.
He's living downtown and he's working in a garage to pay tuition to the University of Chicago.
I did a guest spot on Monster Garage back when I was acting.
And I just love the whole engine-and-cars thing.
- So you're an actress.
That's great.
- Thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome, Sarina.
- Kudos.
- How long have you two been married?
- Six amazing months.
- Right, honey?
- Happy anniversary.
There's Mike, Jake and Sarah.
They compete in skating contests on a regular basis.
- See you.
- Hey!
Sarah!
That's good.
You gotta start with the small steps before you take the big ones.
- Mark Baker?
- Kenny the maniac!
Well, if it isn't my partner in crime.
- You're gonna get in trouble, Murtaugh.
- Only if I get caught, Baker.
Come here.
I wanna show you something.
- Please don't get me in trouble like last time.
- You worry too much.
How are your kids?
I've got three at a private school for gifted children in Lake Forest.
Two at Andover, one at Exeter.
Calvin's at Yale finishing up a field study in particle physics.
Generating a lot of interest.
Eliot was in Sports Illustrated.
Just won the snowboarding junior nationals.
- Slope style.
- Well, that was no surprise.
But I gotta say, Anne's still my superstar.
When she finishes her MBA at Harvard, she's gonna work for me at Murtaugh Enterprises.
Definitely corporate material.
Something reeks.
Get out of the way!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Watch out!
Look out.
She's gonna blow!
Cool.
Listen, mister, accident or not, you'll be taking the garbage out, or something you don't wanna do, for 30 days.
So sit down, please.
Everyone, quiet.
For me.
Parenting comes down to one word - "push." If you don't push, they don't do anything.
- I think it's a little more complicated.
- Is it?
"Most went through periods in their life when they worried about making car payments."
- Hey!
Gotcha!
- Yeah.
Nigel, leave Kyle's pants alone!
Look, no one was hurt.
It's fine.
In fact, why don't you come over to The Boulders sometime?
- The Boulders?
- Our cottage.
We would love to do that sometime...
Hey, kids, why don't you leave the fireworks at home?
You're all welcome at our place.
We've got Seadoos, lasers, wireless internet, plasma screens, satellite TVs, all the toys and whistles.
You know what?
Actually, we're here for quality time with the kids.
Come on, it's time to go.
We've done enough damage here.
- So we'll probably see you on the lake.
- Sure.
Another time.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you too.
Good seeing you again, Tom.
You too...
- Kate.
- Kate.
Boy, you know, when we were kids, I used to be so envious of Tom Baker.
He just had it all.
Well, I guess the Gucci loafer's on the other foot now, isn't it?
- Everyone, straight to bed.
- What a moron.
- He's our son.
- Not Mark, he's a kid.
Murtaugh. "Seems like you could use the word 'push'."
Next time we see him, let's agree to ignore him.
- There's not gonna be a next time.
- I don't know if the kids will agree.
You think that water slide could compete with the tire swing I'm gonna put up?
Rise and shine!
Daylight's burning.
It is breakfast at the Bakers', day one!
Come on, sleepy heads.
Is there a particular reason that we're eating breakfast outside?
- 'Cause it's a beautiful day at Lake Winnetka.
- It's vacation, sweetheart.
And there's the rest of the clan.
Come on.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys, look.
Hey!
Welcome to the land o' plenty.
It still smells the same here.
Like dead leaves, unwashed animals and murky lake water.
- It's called fresh air, sweetheart.
- Watch the hat.
- Hey, guys.
- Come on, let's eat.
We're gonna need a forklift to get Lorraine's suitcase outta here.
What have I been here, 30 seconds, and you're already making fun of me?
Yeah, that was my foot.
- Is that suitcase just for make-up?
- Whatever, Butch.
Big breakfast, everybody, so you have enough room for family activities.
- Family activities?
- Appleschmear.
Fishing for Big Daddy.
The tire swing, the diving board.
- I'm boarding.
- Kenneth has video games.
We were gonna use the Murtaughs' internet to research for the academic decathlon.
Precisely.
We need the extra hours.
Well, you got all vacation to go over to that place.
We have all vacation to do the family activities too.
Sarah, what about you?
You wanna hang out with Dad?
Actually, I was gonna go boarding with Jake.
And Eliot.
Well, you know, I guess we could do lake stuff another day.
Here we go.
Scones.
Henry.
Jake.
All right.
Leave it there, the dog will get it.
Did you nail down an apartment?
I'm just waiting to hear.
I'll bet you could get a place in Chicago for half the rent.
Dad, I thought we made a deal.
That dock needs work.
- Where are you going?
- The hardware store.
I'll fix this place up.
- You got a crazy look.
What are you getting?
- Tools!
Honey.
Honey.
OK.
Do not stand up.
Do you hear me?
Dad!
Dad!
Hello?
Dad!
Hey, kids.
Tire swing ready!
Tire swing not ready.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.
Get bored over at the Murtaughs'?
No.
We're going back after study time.
You guys are making time for your studies?
I'm really proud of you.
Not us, Dad.
Them.
Mr Murtaugh forces all of the kids to read and write two hours every day.
Lame.
I know.
Who are these guys?
- What?
- There's no way I'm camping out.
Yes, honey.
You can do it one night for Daddy.
Come on.
- This doesn't sit well with me.
- I know what you mean.
Lorraine, are you serious?
Is she kidding?
That's not gonna fit in your tent, Lorraine.
I'm gonna make it fit, Dad.
- Hey, come on.
We're making s'mores.
- I'll help you.
Actually, we're trying to eat only organic food.
- We're trying to eat only organic food.
- Is that for the baby?
Come on.
Baby'll love a s'more.
Party in your tummy.
Cool.
The Bakers are having a campout.
Can I go over?
Why have a campout when you can have a full-on fondue party right here?
Sweet.
Charlie, you're worse than a kitten.
Babe, that's your fourth s'more.
My parents never let me have these.
They're amazing.
Do you think we should be more strict with the kids?
No, honey.
We give them love and guidance.
What else is there, really?
Every time we turn around, they're in trouble, about to get into it, or laying out a long-term plan to create it.
Dad, how come those guys know how to camp so good?
- Hey.
Hey!
What if we sing a camp song?
- OK.
Sounds good.
What do you say we give 'em a run for their money?
Come on.
Stand up.
This guy is so competitive!
Boy, I love camping.
Yeah.
This is fun.
- Good times.
Good times.
- Good times, yeah.
Hey, kids.
Didn't you love blowing Murtaugh off the lake last night?
Kids?
Honey, they're all in the house.
- No.
- Yeah.
Hello?
Happy?
They can't spend one night in the tent?
Hey, Tom.
Now, what does that show-off want?
What a day.
Hey, Tom?
Boy, you have got this place looking...
Anyway, I see the troops are sleeping in.
They're already up.
They're out cutting wood and making biscuits and blazing a new trail out back - nothing out of the ordinary.
Yeah.
Really impressive.
Listen, the missus and I are thinking of putting on a little spread.
Since the kids are getting along so well, why don't you and the gang come to The Boulders for brunch?
- Actually, we have to...
- Cool, what time?
Mimosas at noon, on the dot.
Yeah!
Attagirl.
Take it away, honey.
Adios, amigo.
- Isn't he like the coolest dad ever?
- Yeah.
Cool.
Whoa, dude!
Awesome, dude.
Kids, you stay right here.
Welcome to The Boulders.
- Hey.
Let's say hello.
- Hi.
Hey.
Thanks for having us.
Where's the gift shop?
You brought your dog.
- Sorry.
Just say "sit."
- Down, Gunner.
Tom.
Baker!
Somebody help.
- I'm fine.
- They're called obedience schools, Baker!
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Tie Fido up for five minutes.
- Honey, he's fine.
Just let him play.
We don't want that animal near the dining set.
It was a gift from the king of Thailand.
Mark, there's a leash in the car.
Get it.
- Why don't we all go inside?
- Good idea.
I'll be right back.
Sarah.
You wanna go on the Seadoo with me and Jake before we eat?
Yeah.
Sure.
Cool.
Let's go.
Are you coming or not, dude?
Yeah.
Jimmy.
Almost forgot.
Tom, for heaven's sake.
You didn't have to do this.
- "Sparkling Cheesehead"?
- Wisconsin's finest bubbly.
I'm sure it is.
Might have to let this baby age about two, three hundred years, Tom.
Superstar, do me a favor.
Take this to the cellar and bring a bottle of Taittinger.
- Sure.
- I'll give you a hand.
- It's a fantastic place.
- It's not much, but I call it a second home.
How come you guys haven't built your own house up here?
With 12 kids, you've gotta use the money for food and water.
I bet if Tom had kept thatjob at Illinois Poly he could have built a place like this.
Well, life's full of choices.
Some good, some not so good.
Honey, why don't you take Kate and show her the dining set the king of Thailand gave us?
- OK, honey.
- I'd love to look at the plates from a king.
- Don't get lost, honey.
- Tom, I wanna show you something.
Feast your eyes on these honeys, Tom.
Albino ironwood, right out of the Peruvian rainforest.
You can still smell the jungle on 'em.
Go ahead, take a whiff.
Come on.
Rest your honker on the log and take a whiff.
- Smells like global warming.
- That's moss.
It's moss, Tom.
Well, this is the trophy room.
- Are those your kids?
- Yeah.
That's the Murtaugh victory reel.
- It's on a loop.
- It's a good room.
I'll tell you why I love this room so much, Tom.
All the trophies, the ribbons, the prizes - past, present and future.
It's proof that children can be groomed to reflect the best aspects of any given gene pool.
- You just have to keep them on a short leash.
- I couldn't agree more.
My Anne's proof of that.
You're looking a lot more put together than you did a few years ago.
Thanks.
Remember your nose was too big, and that skin irritation on your hand?
Ltjust kept working its way up your arm and into your neck...
I'm glad that it's gone, though.
Looks good.
Well, if I remember correctly, you weren't so hot yourself.
That mutt could use a shorter leash too.
She's so cool.
Yeah, the kids and I spent a weekend putting that dock together.
Nothing like a little manual labor to keep you humble.
Sit down, Tom.
So Jimmy has matching pants to that shirt?
Boy, this place wasn't put together overnight.
- Does Daddy know about your tattoo?
- No.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm so sorry.
It's OK.
I'm fine.
- It's like spring break.
Hope I win.
- I've got a shirt you can borrow.
- A shirt?
OK.
- Mom, I...
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- If my dad finds out before I...
- You'll get grounded?
Please, just don't say anything.
Nice hands.
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey, Dad.
You should see Mr Murtaugh's new Seadoo.
That's terrific.
Now turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Why?
Turn around and pretend to be looking at the view.
Are you still in touch with your dark gifts?
Punking, practical jokes, soaking underwear and...
- Meat.
- Yeah.
- Classic.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm in touch.
Why?
- I have a mission for you.
Who's the target?
Murtaugh.
I can help you.
Hi.
- As long as I don't do time for the crime.
- Hey, guys.
Hi.
Done.
No grounding.
No allowance dockage.
No spiel about the difference between right and wrong.
And you have no problem with the methods that I choose.
It's your contract, do with it what you will.
- Agreed?
- Agreed.
Hey, give Daddy a hug.
Nail him.
Guys, guys.
Guys!
I have a mission for you.
- It's top-secret, and it's high-priority.
- Yeah?
What is it?
Come on.
I'll show you.
- Positions.
- Check.
My gosh.
It's a purple bigfoot.
- What are you talking about?
- A purple bigfoot!
- A what?
- I don't see anything.
Made you look, made you look.
- Made you look.
- You are so stupid.
- Did I mention the dining set was a gift?
- The king of Thailand.
Yeah, you did.
- Give me that roll.
- I see your kids can't wait to get started.
Well, that's just the way they are.
Hey, you guys.
No eating until everyone's seated.
- Eyes up here, honey.
- Doesn't she look hot?
Doesn't hold a candle to you, honey.
Come on, let's sit down.
- Where have you been all my life?
- All right.
- Tom, right over here.
- Thank you.
Ignore the place card.
Sit next to your wife.
Fine.
Fine, if you want chaos.
Right here, Tom.
Believe me, I don't mind.
Dad.
Don't...
The seat cushion is soft.
- So, you two play tennis?
- Yeah.
- You're in the meat seat.
- What?
I knew that dog was gonna be trouble.
Sit!
My china.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
It's OK.
It happens all the time.
It doesn't.
I'm so sorry.
I'm really embarrassed.
Thank you for the lovely shirt.
I insist that you send me a bill for this.
Don't even think about it.
What's a few thousand dollars here or there?
The main thing is you had a good time.
We'll talk about it later.
I'll see you on the tennis court.
Bring your A game.
- Bye.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
- That was not nothing.
This was not nothing.
That was something.
All right.
In the house.
I know.
I'm a horrible father.
- Honey, you broke your promise.
- What promise?
That you'd not get involved in this competitive thing.
It's just all so infantile.
- He tried to tell us how to raise the kids.
- Meaning?
- He thinks the kids are...
- Did he say it?
No, but you could tell that he implied that's what he thought, that the kids were...
That's right.
"I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-l-am."
Aren't you a little old for that book?
- She's reading to the baby.
- Reading to the baby?
Unborn babies, they're comforted by the sound of their mother's voice.
- Just don't spoil my linebacker.
- The baby's gonna be what it wants to be.
Just let us be the parents, OK, Dad?
Come on, Bud.
I'm hungry.
Yeah.
Me too.
- Hi, Mr Baker.
- Hi, Eliot.
What's up?
- I was looking for Sarah.
- You mean Jake?
Sarah and I and Calvin, we're going boarding this afternoon.
Well, she'll be back soon.
- OK.
I'll just wait on the dock.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Sit down.
What do you do for a living, Eliot?
- I'm in eighth grade.
- Yeah.
Right.
- And how's that going for you?
- Fine.
- Are you on any teams?
- Football, boarding and baseball.
All that focus on sports - that must impact your grades quite a bit.
No.
Actually, you know, I'm an honors student.
- You play any instruments?
- Drums.
You're probably in one of those punk bands, right?
Timpani.
You know, school orchestra.
- Hey, Eliot.
- See you, Mr Baker.
Later, dude...
Dad.
Guys.
- What now?
- Mind if I go waterboarding with you?
It's kneeboarding, and I'm pretty sure you can't do it.
If Jimmy can do it, I can.
You must be Calvin.
- Nice to meet you.
I just got back from Yale.
- Congratulations.
I'll just squeeze in over here.
There we go.
- Is everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Fun?
- Yeah.
Why don't you go first?
Guys, keep an eye on him, all right?
You ready, Mr Baker?
OK, I'm...
- Sorry he interrogated you.
- My dad would have done the same thing.
- Really?
- You should come to my house sometime.
He's really easy and likes to keep low-key.
- Do you have a favorite subject?
- Probably math.
Stop!
You'll do better next time, Mr Baker.
It's OK.
- Are you sure he'll be OK?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.
Dad!
Are you OK?
It's all good.
Well...
I'll go put on a little perfume.
Sarah, Eliot seems OK.
- I see why you like him.
- Somebody's turning red.
Shut up!
Thanks a lot, Dad.
- What did I say?
- Men can be so clueless.
Honey, men are clueless.
- I'll go talk to her.
- Mom, let me do this, OK?
Trust me, I've got experience in the area of parental harassment.
Hey, I totally know how you feel.
How are you?
Dad can be pretty hands-on, in-your-face sometimes.
Just leave me alone.
A, I'm never trying to help her again.
And B, I cannot wait to move to New York.
- What are you doing here?
- This is where I run.
What are you doing?
- I like to get out of the house.
- Take a break from the perfect daughter bit?
Hey, I'm not the only one who's putting on an act for Daddy around here.
You've hated the city since we were kids.
- Why go to school there?
- Seemed like the right thing to do.
Did it seem like the right thing to do because your parents said it was the right thing to do?
No.
My parents wanted me closer to home, that's why.
Are you gonna live at home forever?
I just gotta figure out my next move and do it.
How about you, superstar?
What's the master plan?
Somehow I gotta tell my dad I'm not built for corporate life.
- Good luck.
- So for now, I'm just gonna draw.
- What do you draw?
- Stay still, Baker.
Whoa.
Yeah, right.
You're not drawing me, 'cause I'm gonna...
Right here?
Is this good?
- If I stay here?
It might be better...
- Stop smiling.
- Sarah, come on.
Hurry up!
- OK.
OK.
- Has anybody seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.
No, I haven't.
- Have you seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.
Chiseler!
You chiseling little...
Great.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, guys.
- Good to see you.
- Hi.
Nice shoes.
Kidding.
Let's warm up.
OK, let's do it.
- Come on, Murtaugh!
- Got it.
I don't remember you out here when we were kids.
Dad didn't allow us to come out into the woods.
OK, I'm done.
That's Charlie Baker figuring out his next move.
- You're good.
- Tell my dad.
Maybe he'll let me transfer to Madison Art School.
- You wanna live up here and go to school?
- This lake is my favorite place on the planet.
- Why?
- I've always fantasized about moving here.
I don't know, maybe open up a garage or something.
- Looks like you figured out your next move.
- I think you're right.
Wanna go for a walk or something?
- Is Charlie Baker asking me out on a date?
- I'm not sure our fathers would approve.
Let's go.
Yours.
Nice.
Nice!
This is mine.
- It's these shoes.
- OK.
All right.
A poor workman blames his tools, Tom.
- Just serve it.
- This is payback for the china.
Come on.
Give me your best, Jimmy, give me your best.
- I got it.
- I got it.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- I got it.
Mine.
- Got it.
- I got it.
- Mine.
- Whoa.
- It's turbo.
- I'm in so much trouble.
There's no way.
- Don't be a wimp.
- I'm not a wimp.
- Come on.
Get in.
- OK, just one little cruise.
Come on, Baker.
I'm getting old here.
Just be careful.
Whoa!
Slow down!
Mr and Mrs Baker, excuse me.
There's a call from security over at the gift shop.
- What's this about?
- Just follow me.
Slow down!
Stop!
Slow down!
We're willing to let it slide if you promise to keep your kids under control.
I really appreciate that.
We'll take care of it.
- There you go.
Thanks, Skippy.
- Thank you, Mr Murtaugh.
Are you just gonna talk to her?
How I discipline my kids is none of your business.
You know, I've been trying to say this in a nice way, but...
Well, there's a reason your kids are screw-ups.
My kids screwed up.
They are not screw-ups.
You're not strict enough.
Parenting isn't a popularity contest, Tom, but I guess if you knew that, your kids wouldn't be so undisciplined.
The only problem with my kids is they're hanging out with yours.
It wasn't my daughter who got caught stealing.
It wasn't my son who trashed a tennis court.
Do you actually think I'm screwing up my kids, Baker?
Yeah.
And one day they're gonna crack.
Well, why don't we test that theory?
On Labor Day.
Murtaughs versus Bakers.
For the cup.
You're on.
We'll see you there.
Let's go.
Did you just agree to that competition thing and the cup?
Yeah.
OK, missy, let's go walk and talk.
Now, tell me what this is all about, because it's so not you.
- I was embarrassed.
- Look at me, honey.
Embarrassed about what?
Make-up.
Honey, you know you can come to me any time with anything.
You know that, right?
And I know why you wanted the make-up.
It was for Eliot, right?
Yeah.
I'm just not pretty like Nora or Lorraine.
I thought maybe the make-up would help.
You're beautiful.
I want you to remember something else that's really important.
When you like a boy, never be anybody but yourself.
Eliot liked you without make-up, didn't he?
- Do you think he really likes me?
- How could he not?
- No more felonies.
Deal?
- Deal.
Good.
- The Labor Day Cup's gonna be a bloodbath.
- You got that right.
From now on, no seeing the Murtaughs, no talking to them, no thinking about them.
- Can't we compete and still see them?
- No.
Right now, I am not a father.
I am a coach.
And we're gonna be training twice a day, every day, starting outside in ten minutes.
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks.
Good.
Lorraine, come on.
Push-ups.
One, two.
Now back up to jumping jacks.
- Lorraine, come on.
- OK.
And toss.
Toss.
- Toss.
Toss.
- Dad!
- Just toss.
- Dad, lay off.
- Toss!
- I'm tossing.
No crying.
- Step back.
- That's it.
I can't handle the pressure, Dad!
Eggs cost money.
OK, it's a three-legged race, but run as if you had two!
On your mark, get set, go.
Go.
Let's go.
- Your fault!
- Hey!
Come on, come on, get in.
Come on.
- Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
Murtaugh!
- Dad!
We're not Murtaughs!
Take a deep swing.
Boom, just like that.
Give it a good one.
Come on.
One more.
That's a zero.
I really love having a family dinner where all you can hear is forks hitting the plates.
You know, this could be our last chance together and you're totally ruining it.
I'm glad we're moving to Houston.
And so is Iron Mike or Donna Baker Butkus McNulty.
Bulk up.
You're burning a hole in my face.
Tom.
You've gotta stop this whole training camp thing.
This is not some little fence-line squabble.
This is an epic battle between two families.
No.
No, no, honey.
I think this is Tom versus Jimmy.
I'm sorry, General, but you're losing the respect of your troops.
That's dangerous.
Give the kids some space.
Are you asking me to back out?
No, honey.
It's just...
Especially with Sarah.
This is her first crush.
Come on.
- What, with Eliot?
- Yes.
She needs to know that we trust her.
She couldn't come to me and tell me she wanted to wear make-up.
Is that the kind of relationship you want her to have with us?
- Hey.
How are you?
- Hi.
Let's run.
Just leave it.
They'll get somebody.
The kids drop stuff all the time and leave me.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
- How do you manage 12 kids?
- With great difficulty.
Trust me.
Good, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.
You've got a lot of fruit.
I'd get some of this refined sugar.
It's great for negotiating purposes or whatever.
Jimmy's gone overboard with this tough love thing.
The kids are miserable and he doesn't even see it.
He and Tom bring out the best in each other.
I'm actually getting a kick out of it.
Very entertaining.
- And exhausting.
- This is good.
If tonight's good, I'll ask my dad.
So hopefully tonight will work.
OK.
See you.
Not my little girl.
Hey, Dad.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I just need you to help me pace out 25 yards for the egg race, starting here, OK?
There you go.
- Yeah.
- OK, go ahead.
- Hey, Dad, I was...
- Those steps are too small.
- Those steps...
- Can I go to the movies with Eliot tonight?
...are too big.
I guess so.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Nora has to urinate, and a full bladder puts inordinate strain on the embryotic sac...
Kim!
Thank you.
We could just go with "hurry up."
Hurry up!
I need Lorraine.
You get Lorraine, I'll pee outside.
Hey.
It's me.
How's it going?
Eliot asked me out, and I'm kind of new to the dating thing, so...
- Are you gonna make me beg?
- I was thinking about it.
Come on.
Let's start with your make-up.
Lorraine...
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.
- Pink?
- Come on.
Can't we do, like, a skin color?
There you go.
It looks good.
Hey, guys.
Guys.
I need everybody's attention.
Sarah's about to come downstairs, and she's going on her date tonight.
She looks a little different, so I would really appreciate it if you guys could give her the respect that you never gave me, and not ridicule her style choices before she enters the world of multi-gender interaction.
So go about your little chores and act completely natural.
Lorraine.
I think you're going to do just fine in New York.
Thank you.
Hubba-hubba.
You look very pretty, honey.
You always do.
Thank you.
Well, I'm going to the movies.
Well, sounds good.
Need some money?
No.
I have some from lawn mowing.
- Limo's here.
- There's Mr Murtaugh.
Well, have fun, and I'll pick you up outside the theater at nine.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye, cutie.
I'll save a spot for you on the varsity.
Have fun.
- Cute, isn't she?
- Yeah.
Seems like yesterday that was you, missy.
- You're not gonna start crying, are you, Dad?
- I'm a football coach, remember?
- I like Henrietta.
- You are not calling it Henrietta.
All right.
What have we got to eat?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?
Honey, do you want something to eat?
Tom, do you want something to eat?
No.
You know what?
Actually, I should go get Sarah.
It's 7:30.
The movie just started.
I'm not going directly.
I'm just gonna stop and get gas first.
There's bound to be traffic, 'cause it's Labor Day weekend.
- Sure there is.
- I'll get going.
And I don't trust those fish clocks.
They're notoriously slow.
I love you, sweetheart.
Thank you.
One, please.
What are you doing here?
If you must know, I'm here to make sure this movie is appropriate for our children.
It's rated G.
Sir, could you please sit down?
- What are you doing here so early?
- Father of the daughter always arrives early.
- Everybody knows that.
- Excuse me.
Is there a problem here?
- He's harassing me.
- He's guilty of overparenting.
If you two can't keep it down, I'm going to throw both of you out.
My God.
Look at this.
What?
He's stretching.
- He's doing "the move."
- What move?
You're sitting in the theater, you fake a yawn...
Oh, boy, am I tired.
Hand comes over.
Then a little while later, head comes over, giving you extra reach here.
Mom, look at those two down there.
See what I mean?
Sweet Jesus.
- Warning number two.
- He was showing me "the move."
Do you mind?
- You don't know "the move"?
- No.
I don't know "the move," OK?
And I wasn't a hormone-crazed Romeo when I was a kid.
I had self-control.
- I had social sophistication, like my son.
- Be quiet down there!
- Your son has hormones like every teenager.
- Meaning what?
Meaning on the sophistication scale, he's one step above ape.
- Are you calling my son an ape?
- He's an ape like every other male teenager.
- Take it back.
- I'm not gonna take it back.
Take it...
Take it back.
- Were you gonna poke me?
- No, I was not gonna poke you.
- You were gonna poke me.
- Because you were asking for it.
If I'm asking for it, why don't you give it to me?
- You want a poke?
- What's going on down there?
- Call that a poke?
- I call that a practice.
- Give me your best poke.
I want your best.
- You're asking for it.
I do.
Yeah.
Hey!
Call somebody.
Somebody help.
- Hey, honey, how did it go?
- Dad was totally spying on me.
You ruined everything.
There's no way that I'm competing for you in that stupid cup tomorrow.
- I can't believe you did that.
- Really, Dad, that is so Big Brother.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on, Bud, let's put this baby to bed.
Not cool, Dad.
You and Jimmy aren't so different, Dad.
Different styles, yeah, but same result.
Let's go, guys.
Honey.
Honey, we talked about this, didn't we?
The tighter you hang on, the more they're gonna pull away.
Right?
I'll go talk to her.
Well, we're gonna go compete for the cup.
Couldn't get any more volunteers?
You gonna come and watch us kick some hiney?
Well, maybe I will, honey, when I get everybody fed.
I'm sorry.
- OK, guys.
Come on, let's go.
- Come on, Dad.
And I'm sorry too.
- Did Dad go?
- Yep.
With Kyle and Nigel.
Hey.
The Chiseler's got my wallet.
- Check it out.
- Must have an escape hatch.
- Look at all this stuff.
- That's mine from, like, the '80s.
Careful.
Careful.
Let me see that.
Look at this.
It's our old team flag.
We lost to the Murtaughs by two points.
Yeah, 'cause Mom fell in the sack race.
Daddy carried me all the way home.
Fond memories.
You know your father.
He wants to be a part of every single one of them.
That's why he's having such a hard time letting go.
But one thing - no matter what Daddy says, if he's in a good mood or a bad mood, you're his favorite team, right?
And left.
And right.
And left.
And right.
And left...
Bakers.
What gives, Tom?
Couldn't rally your team?
It's all I've got, but it's enough to take you down, Murtaugh.
Are you kidding me?
You'll be lucky to beat the Doobners.
- We'll see.
Come on, guys.
- We'll see.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th annual Lake Winnetka Labor Day Cup.
Now, we have seven families competing in ten events today.
The family winning the most events will win the cup.
Simple enough.
So let's get to it, all right?
Contestants, here we go.
OK, guys.
Let's do this.
Hey, Dad.
We're here.
Dad!
There's the team.
There's the team.
You can't keep the varsity down.
And I promise never to go on a date with you and Eliot again.
Hey, Murtaugh!
This is our year!
Let's see what you got, Tom.
- OK, Murtaughs.
- Huddling.
I've been ajerk all week, but that's old news.
- Get loose.
Don't let 'em intimidate you.
- Yeah!
You each have a special talent.
I want you to use it.
I don't care if we win or lose.
Just do your best.
OK.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop with the nicey-nice.
Here's the game plan.
We'll step on their throats and press until they stop breathing.
- Yeah!
- Get focused and stay with the game plan.
- What would that be?
- We don't have a game plan, but...
- Chin up.
Charge the mountain!
- Exactly!
That's the game plan.
OK, break on three.
One, two, three.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, go.
Come on, go.
Go, go!
Yes!
Yes!
Yeah, Mark!
Come on.
Go!
Go!
Charge it, charge it, charge it!
Good job.
OK.
That's OK.
- Bull's-eye!
- One for the Bakers!
Come on, Charlie.
- That's it.
That's it.
- Go!
Go!
Go, superstar.
Yeah!
- Gotta be tough, Baker.
Gotta be tough.
- What is this?
Out.
- Here we go, Tom.
- I'm OK, Murtaugh.
Look out.
Not your sport?
Go for ajog.
Come on.
Keep up.
Reverse.
Couldn't have asked for a better day.
Look out!
Ouch.
Well, folks, for the first time since 1961, our Labor Day Cup has ended in a tie.
The Miller family will be taking third place.
And to determine second place and our champion, the Bakers and the Murtaughs are going to have a canoe race from here to the State Forest end of the park and back.
And all family members must participate.
Mike, I got a daughter who's due in a week.
She can't do that.
Tom, maybe you can work something out with Jimmy here.
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit, Tom.
Well...
She can't do it, so we're done.
And congratulations.
I'm going, Dad.
You just pissed off a severely hormonal pregnant woman.
Let's do this!
Nora?
- Are you sure?
- I need a life jacket.
- Go, Bakers.
- Come on, Murtaughs.
- Lose those shoes.
They're fancy and new.
- What?
Yours are the same.
I'm a mom.
I need the height.
Take those off.
Mom.
Mine tie my new outfit in together.
Stay on the north side of the lake.
There's less wind.
- Thanks, Murtaugh.
- You're welcome, Baker.
Let's go, superstar.
It's supposed to be fun.
- You ready?
- Ready.
- On your marks.
- Murtaugh!
- Get set.
- Murtaugh!
Go, Bakers!
Go, Bakers!
Come on, we'll catch up.
Let's go.
We're gonna win this, Murtaughs!
Come on.
Put some muscle in it, Bakers.
Stroke.
- Stroke.
- Stroke.
Come on, superstar.
Come on, Kenneth.
- Not this time, Murtaugh.
- That's what you think.
Stroke, stroke.
I think we're taking on water.
It's me.
My God!
My God!
Nora's waterjust broke.
Jimmy!
- Row!
Row!
- Jimmy!
- Something's wrong, Jimmy.
- He's trying to pull a fast one.
Now, paddle.
- I don't believe it.
- What if somebody's hurt?
Honey, we have a substantial lead.
It's a trick.
- How can you be sure?
- I don't wanna lose.
Now, paddle.
Stroke.
OK, everyone, calm down.
- If we cut through, the road's not far.
- Can you get us there?
- Hello.
Nature boy, remember?
- Let's go.
- Sit tight.
- Go faster.
- No, Bud.
Stay with Nora.
- Row.
Annie, what are you doing?
What are you doing, superstar?
Paddle.
I'm not a superstar, Dad.
I'm just a person who's trying to have her own life.
And this is not my idea of living.
It's yours.
Like my tattoo?
- Annie, get back in this boat.
- You'll have to win it without me too.
Eliot, don't you dare.
Don't you...
- I'm outta here.
- Kenneth!
- Not cool, Dad.
- Becky, don't you...
- You've gotta lighten up.
- Daniel!
- We like the Bakers.
- Yeah, Dad.
Lisa!
Robin!
OK, that's it.
You know what?
You kids are gonna be cut off if you don't, you know...
No more charge accounts.
Think about that.
- What is wrong with you?
- I want to win!
You don't get it, Sarina.
It's not me.
It's him.
It's Tom.
He was always the popular one.
He was the one everybody liked.
Everybody.
All the girls.
All the parents liked him.
- My own father even liked him better.
- That was 18 years before I was born.
Get over it.
Look, your kids are trying to tell you something.
And unless you wanna start looking for wife number four, you'd better listen.
Now, paddle.
- Watch out.
- Are you sure you're OK?
- 50 cents says it's a girl.
- I'll take that bet.
- I'm in.
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- I'm all right, I'm all right.
- I got you, I got you!
That's OK.
I got my hips to balance me.
How are you feeling?
- Cramping a little.
- OK, how often?
Just a couple of times so far.
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- Pay attention to her!
Is she OK?
Yeah.
She's delivering lakeside, but yeah.
Did you swim all the way here?
- Baker, what's going on?
- Nora's having her baby.
We need a hospital.
- What can I do to help?
- You can help with Nora.
- Mark's on point.
Right?
- I know the area really well.
Dad forced me to read topographical maps of this area, for no apparent reason.
Hey, that's my boy.
Lead the way, Kenneth Murtaugh.
My dad has let me have almost every animal in the world, which makes me an expert on scat trails.
- That's my boy.
- Point us the right way, I'll find a scat trail.
- What's "scat"?
- Animal poop.
Cool, we're following poop.
OK, I'm a little competitive.
- I know.
- Go!
Go!
- Come on, guys.
This way.
- There's a road up ahead.
Yeah.
We did it!
Come on, guys, this way.
Come on.
Hurry!
Come on, hurry up!
I'll take it from here.
I got it.
My daughter is about to deliver and I need to get her in.
I don't want her to feel any pain.
I want the baby to be healthy.
Get it?
Good.
- If I could get you to fill out...
- I wouldn't mess with her if I were you, OK?
Right.
- Wow.
- She's having a baby.
Stay calm!
Can we get a chair over here?
!
- Get me in a wheelchair.
- I need a wheelchair, stat!
Get the chair!
- My God.
My God.
- Good luck.
It must be this way.
That way.
All right.
Family only in the delivery room.
- Whoa, whoa!
You're all family?
- Yes.
- Help me out here.
- I'm her mother.
- Of course.
- Kate.
Do your thing.
- OK, come on.
Let's go.
- Tom, actually, we'd like Lorraine to come.
We want you to be the godmother.
Really?
Whoa!
Having a baby here!
- We'll try to get you a linebacker, Tom.
- Come on, everybody.
Come on.
This is a hospital.
You guys have to be quiet.
Tom.
You mind if we wait with you?
That'd be great.
They're good kids, Jimmy.
All of 'em.
And you're saying we have nothing to do with it?
They're born hard-wired.
- Look what we found.
- Check it out.
Hey.
Just be sure and disinfect them.
It's a bedpan, Kenny.
Take it off.
- So your kid gets my kid to wear a bedpan...
- I didn't tell him to do it.
You look in the face of a six-month-old and that's the way they are.
You look like you have something to say.
I'm done with the city, Dad.
I'm gonna open up my own garage and I'm moving up here.
And I wanna audit art classes at Madison.
- Pardon me?
- Dad, I wanna be an artist.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Jimmy.
Although it does sound pretty exciting.
- Sweetheart, is this what you really want?
- I'm sure.
You know, Annie, I was just trying to be a good father.
I know.
- What do you think?
- Sounds like you got your mind made up.
I do.
You OK with that?
Yeah.
I think I am.
Excuse me.
Tom?
You wanna meet your grandson?
Yeah.
You did a good job, honey.
Really good job.
That's a big boy.
Too bad he wasn't there to help us win the cup.
He'll get a chance.
Mike Romanow gave me a deal.
Now we own the big house at the lake.
It'll be nice having you in the neighborhood, Bud.
You Murtaughs better start cranking out grandkids if you wanna compete.
You guys.
My godchild is trying to snooze.
So, any ideas on names?
I think we're going to go with "Tom."
'Cause you taught us that there's no way to be a perfect parent, but a million ways to be a really good one.
And you're about as good as they get.
Say hi to Grandpa.
Go on.
You're so beautiful.
Tom.
Hey, Tom.
Welcome to family.
Letting go is the hardest thing you can do as a parent.
You have to settle with the past, engage in the present, and believe in the future.
That vacation at Lake Winnetka reminded Tom and me that we're always learning as parents, and that the bond is forever.
Even as the kids grow up and venture out on their own, we'll always be with them and they'll always be with us.
Because life is a voyage that's homeward bound.
Is this my normal face?
Hi, Poo-poo.
You want a treat?
Can I redo that?
What are we gonna do?
She'll never walk again, I'll tell you that.
THE END Subtitles by:
Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days.
A time of peace.
When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads.
But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar mastered all four elements.
Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war.
Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation.
Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.
Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads.
And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.
I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.

The Boy in The Iceberg
Subtitle by rendy1287 [at gmail dot com]
Thanks to Acastus and Pandora.
It's not getting away from me this time.
Watch and learn, Katara.
This is how you catch a fish.
Sokka, look!
Shhh~ Katara, you're gonna scare it away.
Mmmm, I can already smell it cookin'!
But Sokka!
I caught one!
Hey!
Ugh!
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?
Ah~ It's not magic.
It's waterbending, and it's...
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.
You're calling me weird?
I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself everytime I see my reflection in the water.
Watch out!
Go left!
Go left!
You call that left?
You don't like my steering.
Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.
So it's my fault?
I knew I should have left you home.
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!
Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!
Uh...
Katara?
I even wash all the clothes!
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?
Let me tell you, not pleasant!
Katara!
Settle down!
No, that's it.
I'm done helping you.
From now on, you're on your own!
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.
You mean I did that?
Yup.
Congratulations.
He's alive!
We have to help.
Katara!
Get back here!
We don't know what that thing is!
Finally.
Uncle, do you realize what this means?
I won't get to finish my game?
It means my search.
It's about to come to an end.
That light came from an incredibly powerful source.
It has to be him!
Or it's just the celestial lights.
We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.
Please, sit.
Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?
I don't need any calming tea!
I need to capture the Avatar.
Helmsman, head a course for the light!
Stop!
Stop it!
I need to ask you something.
What?
Please... come closer.
What is it?
Will you go penguin sledding with me?
Uh... sure.
I guess.
What's going on here?
You tell us!
How'd you get in the ice?
And why aren't you frozen?
I'm not sure.
Appa!
Are you all right?
Wake up, buddy.
Haha!
You're okay!
What is that thing?
This is Appa, my flying bison.
Right.
And this is Katara, my flying sister.
Don't worry.
It'll wash out.
So, do you guys live around here?
Don't answer that!
Did you see that crazy bolt of light?
He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka.
You never told us your name.
I'm A...
I'm Aang.
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.
Really?
It felt higher that that.
Ah, you're an airbender!
Sure am.
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...
I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.
We'd love a ride!
Thanks!
Oh, no...
I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?
You know... before you freeze to death?
Okay.
First time flyers, hold on tight!
Appa, yip yip!
Come on, Appa.
Yip yip.
Wow.
That was truly amazing.
Appa's just tired.
A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky.
You'll see.
Why are you smiling at me like that?
Oh...
I was smiling?
I'm going to bed now.
Yep.
A man needs his rest.
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.
Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.
Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture.
Mine does.
This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.
Hey.
Hey.
Whatcha thinkin' about?
I guess I was wondering your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.
Uhh... no.
I didn't know him...
I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't.
Sorry.
Okay.
Just curious.
Goodnight.
Sleep tight.
Aang!
Aang, wake up!
It's okay.
We're in the village now.
Come on, get ready.
Everyone's waiting to meet you.
Aang, this is the entire village.
Entire village, Aang.
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that?
Did Appa sneeze on me?
Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.
We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.
Extinct'?
Aang, this is my grandmother.
Call me Gran Gran.
What is this, a weapon?
You can't stab anything with this.
It's not for stabbing.
It's for airbending.
Magic trick!
Do it again!
Not magic, airbending.
It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.
Check again!
Whoa... it's flying it's amazing!
Oh, my watchtower!
That was amazing.
Great.
You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.
You're a waterbender!
Well... sort of.
Not yet.
All right.
No more playing.
Come on, Katara, you have chores.
I told you!
He's the real thing, Gran Gran!
I finally found a bender to teach me.
Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.
But he's special.
I can tell.
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.
Sthee?
Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.
Again.
No!
Power in firebending comes from the breath.
Not the muscles.
The breath becomes energy in the body.
The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.
Get it right this time.
Enough.
I've been drilling this sequence all day.
Teach me the next set.
I'm more than ready.
No, you are impatient.
You have yet to master your basics.
Drill it again!
The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.
He must be over a hundred years old by now.
He's had a century to master the four elements.
I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.
You will teach me the advanced set!
Very well.
But first I must finish my roast duck.
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.
In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.
For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?
I gotta pee!
Listen!
Until your fathers return from the war, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.
And that means no potty breaks.
But I really gotta go.
Ugh... okay... who else has to go?
Have you seen Aang?
Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.
Wow!
Everything freezes in there!
Ugh!
Katara, get him out of here.
This lesson is for warriors only.
Stop!
Stop it right now!
What's wrong with you?
We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.
What war?
What are you talking about?
You're kidding, right?
Penguin!
He's kidding, right?
Aang?
Hey, come on little guy.
Wanna go sledding?
Heh heh, I have a way with animals.
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.
You got a deal!
Just one little problem.
I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.
Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?
No.
You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.
This isn't right.
A waterbender needs to master water.
What about the North Pole?
There's another Water Tribe up there, right?
Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.
Maybe.
But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.
It's not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.
But you forget, I have a flying bison.
Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.
Katara, we're gonna find you a master!
That's...
I mean, I don't know.
I've never left home before.
Well, you think about it.
But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?
Okay, listen closely my young pupil.
Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art.
Observe.
I haven't done this since I was a kid!
You still are a kid!
Whoa... what is that?
A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.
Aang, stop!
We're not allowed to go near it.
The ship could be booby trapped.
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.
It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
Okay, back up.
I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation.
I've never seen any war.
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?
I don't know... a few days, maybe?
I think it was more like a hundred years!
What?
That's impossible.
Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?
Think about it.
The war is a century old.
You don't know about it because somehow, you were in there that whole time.
It's the only explanation.
A hundred years!
I can't believe it.
I'm sorry, Aang.
Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.
I did get to meet you.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Aang?
Let's head back.
This place is creepy.
What's that you said about booby traps?
Hold on tight!
The last airbender.
Quite agile for his old age.
Wake my uncle!
Tell him I found the Avatar as well as his hiding place.
Book One:
Water Chapter Two:
The Avatar Returns
Yay!
Aang's back!
I knew it!
You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare!
You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?
Aang didn't do anything.
It was an accident.
Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well we... we boobied... right into it.
Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship.
Now we could all be in danger!
Don't blame Katara!
I brought her there.
It's my fault.
Aha!
The traitor confesses!
Warriors, away from the enemy!
The foreigner is banned from our village!
Sokka, you're making a mistake.
No!
I'm keeping my promise to Dad.
I'm protecting you from threats like him!
Aang is not our enemy!
Don't you see?
Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time.
Fun.
Fun?
We can't fight firebenders with fun!
You should try it sometime.
Get out of our village.
Now!
Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.
Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden.
Sokka is right.
I think it best if the airbender leaves.
Fine!
Then I'm banished too!
C'mon, Aang, let's go!
Where do you think you're going?
To find a waterbender!
Aang is taking me to the North Pole!
I am?
Great!
Katara!
Would you really choose him over your tribe?
Your own family?
Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.
So, you're leaving the South Pole?
This is goodbye?
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.
Where will you go?
Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders.
Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years.
Not looking forward to that.
It was nice meeting everyone.
Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.
Come on, Appa, you can do it!
Yip!
Yip!
Yeh, I thought so.
Aang!
Don't go!
We'll miss you!
I'll miss you too.
Come on, boy.
Katara, you'll feel better after you...
You happy now?
There goes my one chance of becoming a waterbender!
All right!
Ready our defenses!
The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!
But, I gotta...
And no potty breaks!
Yeh, I liked her too.
The village!
Appa, wait here!
Oh man!
Ohhh, man!
Sokka, get out of the way!
Where are you hiding him?
He'd be about this age?
Master of all elements?
I know you're hiding him!
Show no fear!
Hey Katara.
Hey Sokka.
Hi...
Aang.
Thanks for comin'.
Looking for me?
You're the airbender?
You're the Avatar?
Aang?
No way.
I've spent years preparing for this encounter.
Training.
Meditating.
You're just a child!
Well, you're just a teenager.
If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?
No, Aang!
Don't do this!
Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay.
Take care of Appa for me until I get back.
Head a course to the Fire Nation.
I'm going home.
We have to go after that ship, Sokka.
Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.
Katara, I...
Why can't you realize that he's on our side?
If we don't help him, no one will.
I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I...
Katara!
Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?
Sokka!
Get in.
We're going to save your boyfriend.
He's not my...
Whatever.
What do you two think you're doing?
You'll need these.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
It's been so long since I've had hope.
But you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.
And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister.
Yeah... okay, Gran.
Aang is the Avatar.
He's the world's only chance.
You both found him for a reason.
Now your destinies are intertwined with his.
There's no way we're gonna catch a war ship with a canoe.
Appa!
You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?
This staff will make an excellent gift for my father.
I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks.
Take the Avatar to the prison hold.
And take this to my quarters.
Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?
So...
I guess you never fought an airbender before.
I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.
Silence!
The Avatar has escaped!
Go.
Fly.
Soar.
Please, Appa, we need your help.
Aang needs your help.
Up.
Ascend.
Elevate.
Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.
Come on.
Don't you wanna save Aang?
What was it that kid said?
Yee-ha?
Hup hup?
Wahoo?
Uh... yip yip?
You did it, Sokka!
He's flying!
He's flying!
Katara, he's...!
I mean, big deal, he's flying.
You haven't seen my staff around, have you?
Thanks anyway!
Sorry...
My staff!
Looks like I underestimated you.
What is that?
Appa!
Aang!
No!
Aang!
Aang!
Aang...!
Did you see what he just did?
Now that was some waterbending!
Aang!
Are you okay?
Hey Katara.
Hey Sokka.
Thanks for coming.
Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.
I dropped my staff.
Got it!
Ha!
That's from the Water Tribe!
Katara!
Hurry up, Sokka!
I'm just a guy with a boomerang, I didn't ask for all this flying and magic.
Yip yip!
Yip yip!
Shoot them down!
Good news for the Fire Lord.
The Fire Nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.
That kid, Uncle, just did this.
I won't underestimate him again.
Dig this ship out and follow them!
As soon as you're done with that.
How did you do that?
With the water?
It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
I don't know.
I just sort of... did it.
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?
Because...
I never wanted to be.
But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.
And how am I going to do that?
According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?
That's what the monks told me.
Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.
We can learn it together!
And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.
I'd like that.
I'd really like that.
Then we're in this together.
All right, but before I learn waterbending we have some serious business to attend to here, here, and here.
What's there?
Here we'll ride the hopping llamas.
Then waaaay over here we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.
Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys.
They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!

Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days.
A time of peace.
When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads.
But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar mastered all four elements.
Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war.
Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation.
Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.
Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads.
And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.
I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.

Thanks to Acastus and Pandora.
It's not getting away from me this time.
Watch and learn, Katara.
This is how you catch a fish.
Sokka, look!
Shhh~ Katara, you're gonna scare it away.
Mmmm, I can already smell it cookin'!
But Sokka!
I caught one!
Hey!
Ugh!
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?
Ah~ It's not magic.
It's waterbending, and it's...
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.
You're calling me weird?
I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself everytime I see my reflection in the water.
Watch out!
Go left!
Go left!
You call that left?
You don't like my steering.
Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.
So it's my fault?
I knew I should have left you home.
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!
Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!
Uh...
Katara?
I even wash all the clothes!
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?
Let me tell you, not pleasant!
Katara!
Settle down!
No, that's it.
I'm done helping you.
From now on, you're on your own!
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.
You mean I did that?
Yup.
Congratulations.
He's alive!
We have to help.
Katara!
Get back here!
We don't know what that thing is!
Finally.
Uncle, do you realize what this means?
I won't get to finish my game?
It means my search.
It's about to come to an end.
That light came from an incredibly powerful source.
It has to be him!
Or it's just the celestial lights.
We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.
Please, sit.
Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?
I don't need any calming tea!
I need to capture the Avatar.
Helmsman, head a course for the light!
Stop!
Stop it!
I need to ask you something.
What?
Please... come closer.
What is it?
Will you go penguin sledding with me?
Uh... sure.
I guess.
What's going on here?
You tell us!
How'd you get in the ice?
And why aren't you frozen?
I'm not sure.
Appa!
Are you all right?
Wake up, buddy.
Haha!
You're okay!
What is that thing?
This is Appa, my flying bison.
Right.
And this is Katara, my flying sister.
Don't worry.
It'll wash out.
So, do you guys live around here?
Don't answer that!
Did you see that crazy bolt of light?
He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka.
You never told us your name.
I'm A...
I'm Aang.
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.
Really?
It felt higher that that.
Ah, you're an airbender!
Sure am.
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...
I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.
We'd love a ride!
Thanks!
Oh, no...
I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?
You know... before you freeze to death?
Okay.
First time flyers, hold on tight!
Appa, yip yip!
Come on, Appa.
Yip yip.
Wow.
That was truly amazing.
Appa's just tired.
A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky.
You'll see.
Why are you smiling at me like that?
Oh...
I was smiling?
I'm going to bed now.
Yep.
A man needs his rest.
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.
Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.
Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture.
Mine does.
This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.
Hey.
Hey.
Whatcha thinkin' about?
I guess I was wondering your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.
Uhh... no.
I didn't know him...
I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't.
Sorry.
Okay.
Just curious.
Goodnight.
Sleep tight.
Aang!
Aang, wake up!
It's okay.
We're in the village now.
Come on, get ready.
Everyone's waiting to meet you.
Aang, this is the entire village.
Entire village, Aang.
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that?
Did Appa sneeze on me?
Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.
We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.
Extinct'?
Aang, this is my grandmother.
Call me Gran Gran.
What is this, a weapon?
You can't stab anything with this.
It's not for stabbing.
It's for airbending.
Magic trick!
Do it again!
Not magic, airbending.
It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.
Check again!
Whoa... it's flying it's amazing!
Oh, my watchtower!
That was amazing.
Great.
You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.
You're a waterbender!
Well... sort of.
Not yet.
All right.
No more playing.
Come on, Katara, you have chores.
I told you!
He's the real thing, Gran Gran!
I finally found a bender to teach me.
Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.
But he's special.
I can tell.
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.
Sthee?
Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.
Again.
No!
Power in firebending comes from the breath.
Not the muscles.
The breath becomes energy in the body.
The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.
Get it right this time.
Enough.
I've been drilling this sequence all day.
Teach me the next set.
I'm more than ready.
No, you are impatient.
You have yet to master your basics.
Drill it again!
The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.
He must be over a hundred years old by now.
He's had a century to master the four elements.
I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.
You will teach me the advanced set!
Very well.
But first I must finish my roast duck.
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.
In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.
For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?
I gotta pee!
Listen!
Until your fathers return from the war, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.
And that means no potty breaks.
But I really gotta go.
Ugh... okay... who else has to go?
Have you seen Aang?
Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.
Wow!
Everything freezes in there!
Ugh!
Katara, get him out of here.
This lesson is for warriors only.
Stop!
Stop it right now!
What's wrong with you?
We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.
What war?
What are you talking about?
You're kidding, right?
Penguin!
He's kidding, right?
Aang?
Hey, come on little guy.
Wanna go sledding?
Heh heh, I have a way with animals.
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.
You got a deal!
Just one little problem.
I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.
Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?
No.
You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.
This isn't right.
A waterbender needs to master water.
What about the North Pole?
There's another Water Tribe up there, right?
Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.
Maybe.
But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.
It's not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.
But you forget, I have a flying bison.
Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.
Katara, we're gonna find you a master!
That's...
I mean, I don't know.
I've never left home before.
Well, you think about it.
But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?
Okay, listen closely my young pupil.
Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art.
Observe.
I haven't done this since I was a kid!
You still are a kid!
Whoa... what is that?
A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.
Aang, stop!
We're not allowed to go near it.
The ship could be booby trapped.
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.
It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
Okay, back up.
I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation.
I've never seen any war.
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?
I don't know... a few days, maybe?
I think it was more like a hundred years!
What?
That's impossible.
Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?
Think about it.
The war is a century old.
You don't know about it because somehow, you were in there that whole time.
It's the only explanation.
A hundred years!
I can't believe it.
I'm sorry, Aang.
Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.
I did get to meet you.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Aang?
Let's head back.
This place is creepy.
What's that you said about booby traps?
Hold on tight!
The last airbender.
Quite agile for his old age.
Wake my uncle!
Tell him I found the Avatar as well as his hiding place.
Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days.

Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.
Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads.
And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.
I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.
Book One:
Water Chapter One:
The Boy in The Iceberg
It's not getting away from me this time.
Watch and learn, Katara.
This is how you catch a fish.
Sokka, look!
Shhh.....
Katara, you're gonna scare it away.
Mmmm, I can already smell it cookin'!
But Sokka!
I caught one!
Hey!
Ugh!
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?
Ah~ It's not magic.
It's waterbending, and it's...
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.
You're calling me weird?
I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself everytime I see my reflection in the water.
Watch out!
Go left!
Go left!
You call that left?
You don't like my steering.
Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.
So it's my fault?
I knew I should have left you home.
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!
Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp while you've been off playing soldier!
Uh...
Katara?
I even wash all the clothes!
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks?
Let me tell you, not pleasant!
Katara!
Settle down!
No, that's it.
I'm done helping you.
From now on, you're on your own!
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.
You mean I did that?
Yup.
Congratulations.
He's alive!
We have to help.
Katara!
Get back here!
We don't know what that thing is!
Finally.
Uncle, do you realize what this means?
I won't get to finish my game?
It means my search.
It's about to come to an end.
That light came from an incredibly powerful source.
It has to be him!
Or it's just the celestial lights.
We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.
Please, sit.
Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?
I don't need any calming tea!
I need to capture the Avatar.
Helmsman, head a course for the light!
Stop!
Stop it!
I need to ask you something.
What?
Please... come closer.
What is it?
Will you go penguin sledding with me?
Uh... sure.
I guess.
What's going on here?
You tell us!
How'd you get in the ice?
And why aren't you frozen?
I'm not sure.
Appa!
Are you all right?
Wake up, buddy.
Haha!
You're okay!
What is that thing?
This is Appa, my flying bison.
Right.
And this is Katara, my flying sister.
Don't worry.
It'll wash out.
So, do you guys live around here?
Don't answer that!
Did you see that crazy bolt of light?
He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka.
You never told us your name.
I'm A...
I'm Aang.
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.
Really?
It felt higher that that.
Ah, you're an airbender!
Sure am.
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...
I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.
We'd love a ride!
Thanks!
Oh, no...
I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?
You know... before you freeze to death?
Okay.
First time flyers, hold on tight!
Appa, yip yip!
Come on, Appa.
Yip yip.
Wow.
That was truly amazing.
Appa's just tired.
A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky.
You'll see.
Why are you smiling at me like that?
Oh...
I was smiling?
I'm going to bed now.
Yep.
A man needs his rest.
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.
Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.
Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture.
Mine does.
This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.
Hey.
Hey.
Whatcha thinkin' about?
I guess I was wondering your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.
Uhh... no.
I didn't know him...
I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't.
Sorry.
Okay.
Just curious.
Goodnight.
Sleep tight.
Aang!
Aang, wake up!
It's okay.
We're in the village now.
Come on, get ready.
Everyone's waiting to meet you.
Aang, this is the entire village.
Entire village, Aang.
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that?
Did Appa sneeze on me?
Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.
We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.
Extinct'?
Aang, this is my grandmother.
Call me Gran Gran.
What is this, a weapon?
You can't stab anything with this.
It's not for stabbing.
It's for airbending.
Magic trick!
Do it again!
Not magic, airbending.
It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.
Check again!
Whoa... it's flying it's amazing!
Oh, my watchtower!
That was amazing.
Great.
You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.
You're a waterbender!
Well... sort of.
Not yet.
All right.
No more playing.
Come on, Katara, you have chores.
I told you!
He's the real thing, Gran Gran!
I finally found a bender to teach me.
Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.
But he's special.
I can tell.
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.
Sthee?
Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.
Again.
No!
Power in firebending comes from the breath.
Not the muscles.
The breath becomes energy in the body.
The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.
Get it right this time.
Enough.
I've been drilling this sequence all day.
Teach me the next set.
I'm more than ready.
No, you are impatient.
You have yet to master your basics.
Drill it again!
The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.
He must be over a hundred years old by now.
He's had a century to master the four elements.
I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.
You will teach me the advanced set!
Very well.
But first I must finish my roast duck.
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.
In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.
For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?
I gotta pee!
Listen!
Until your fathers return from the war, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.
And that means no potty breaks.
But I really gotta go.
Ugh... okay... who else has to go?
Have you seen Aang?
Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.
Wow!
Everything freezes in there!
Ugh!
Katara, get him out of here.
This lesson is for warriors only.
Stop!
Stop it right now!
What's wrong with you?
We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.
What war?
What are you talking about?
You're kidding, right?
Penguin!
He's kidding, right?
Aang?
Hey, come on little guy.
Wanna go sledding?
Heh heh, I have a way with animals.
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.
You got a deal!
Just one little problem.
I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.
Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?
No.
You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.
This isn't right.
A waterbender needs to master water.
What about the North Pole?
There's another Water Tribe up there, right?
Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.
Maybe.
But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.
It's not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.
But you forget, I have a flying bison.
Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.
Katara, we're gonna find you a master!
That's...
I mean, I don't know.
I've never left home before.
Well, you think about it.
But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?
Okay, listen closely my young pupil.
Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art.
Observe.
I haven't done this since I was a kid!
You still are a kid!
Whoa... what is that?
A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.
Aang, stop!
We're not allowed to go near it.
The ship could be booby trapped.
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.
It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.
Okay, back up.
I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation.
I've never seen any war.
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?
I don't know... a few days, maybe?
I think it was more like a hundred years!
What?
That's impossible.
Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?
Think about it.
The war is a century old.
You don't know about it because somehow, you were in there that whole time.
It's the only explanation.
A hundred years!
I can't believe it.
I'm sorry, Aang.
Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.
I did get to meet you.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Aang?
Let's head back.
This place is creepy.
What's that you said about booby traps?
Hold on tight!
The last airbender.
Quite agile for his old age.
Wake my uncle.
Tell him, I found the Avatar.
As well as, his hiding place.
Water.
Earth.
Fire.
Air.
My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days.
A time of peace.
When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads.
But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.
Only the Avatar mastered all four elements.
Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders.
But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war.
Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation.
Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.
Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads.
And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.
I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.

I can't believe it.
I'm sorry, Aang.
Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.

Let's head back.
This place is creepy.
What's that you said about booby traps?
Hold on tight!
The last airbender.
Quite agile for his old age.
Wake my uncle!
Tell him I found the Avatar as well as his hiding place.
- On the side.
- You didn't do that on purpose.
- Otherwise that would have been a great shot.
- Watch this.
Side pocket.
- Holy shit!
- What?
"Christopher Murray, a teacher at St. Vincent's Elementary... has been accused of sexually abusing two former students."
- St. Vincent's?
That's that school you went to, right, Mac?
- Yeah, me and Charlie.
What else does it say?
"Murray has been the physical education teacher and boys' basketball coach for 25 years."
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Ah. "The accusers are two brothers whose names are being withheld...
"but the investigation will focus on the mid-1980s...
"as the time period for alleged abuse.
The police are hoping more young men will come forward."
- Wow.
That's horrible.
- Did this guy teach you guys?
- Yeah.
- No.
Yes, he did.
We were in the same class.
No.
Yeah.
Well, no, I didn't like it though.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I didn't like that class.
- What?
- I gotta go!
Holy shit.
Charlie got molested.
When dealing with molestation, the first step is always understanding.
So we need to take a moment and assess the situation.
Write this down.
What?
No, look.
First of all, we can't sit around and let him wallow in it.
And second of all, the first step is acknowledgment.
So I better write that down.
- No.
No, no.
- Whoa!
What, guys...
What the hell are you guys talking about?
Sweet Dee and I took psychology at Penn, so let the grown-ups talk.
- Okay?
Thank you.
- Okay?
Listen.
I think we need to have an intervention.
You know, bring his friends and family together for support.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Let's tell everybody Charlie knows that he got blown by a gym teacher.
Then we'll throw him a little surprise party, celebrate the occasion.
Okay, you know what?
You being a smartass... not helping Charlie.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who said anything about getting blown?
The article didn't specify what type of abuse it was.
It could have been anything.
Yeah, but do you think he got blown?
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know?
Probably got blown.
Which is why I think you need to reconsider my idea.
Okay.
You know what?
Stop.
I'm sorry.
We need to clarify something here.
Do you think that Murray blew these guys?
Why are you so obsessed with the blowing aspect of all this?
Because I knew these two brothers that the article was talking about.
The McPoyle twins...
Ryan and Liam.
Okay?
They were the type of kids that would blow snot bubbles and rub 'em over each other.
They were gross, and they smelled like a couple of unwiped assholes.
So what?
Well, if Murray is, like, fondling or touching them, whatever...
I get it, all right?
But if he's dishing out blow jobs, come on.
- I just don't understand.
- What do you not get?
- What are you talking about?
- You're not getting this?
I was in that class with them, all right?
I was with those guys!
- Um, are you okay, dude?
- No, dude.
I'm not okay.
How come you're getting so upset?
The police are asking for more young men to come forward.
That means there are more guys out there who've been blown.
- What are you looking for?
- Photographs.
I have photographs.
- Oh, my God.
You have photographs of it?
- Oh!
Okay.
Listen, are you trying to say that you got molested?
Okay, look at this.
Look at this guy, huh?
I was cute.
I was energetic.
I was fun.
I mean, what exactly was this prick looking for?
- What are you...
- Sorry?
If the McPoyles got blown and Charlie got blown... then why didn't I get blown?
- You're goin' to hell, dude.
- Seriously.
Yo!
McPoyle!
Hey, open up!
Hey, Charlie.
Long time no see.
- What do you want?
- Is your brother here, man?
I gotta talk to you guys.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.
Come on, man.
I need to talk to you guys.
Go.
Move.
Go.
Go.
Come on.
- I'm not gonna walk in front of you!
Go.
- Just come in.
- No, you go first, and I will follow you.
- Shut the door.
I will shut the door.
- Whoa.
That was really weird.
- Yeah.
Well, this confirms it.
He definitely got molested.
Ugh.
We gotta get in there.
- Get...
We gotta get in there?
- Yes.
You can't just thrust yourself in the position of caregiver like that.
"Caregiver"?
Why are you throwing around big words?
- I actually majored in psych, so...
- You failed all your classes.
- So?
- I had a minor, and I passed all mine.
Well, you know what?
Three-quarters of a major is bigger than a whole minor.
- I don't even know how to respond to that.
- That doesn't surprise me.
Well, it shouldn't because what you said is really dumb, you know.
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, it is.
- That was good.
I liked that one.
- I felt good about it.
- So did you want a beverage of some kind?
- No!
Where's your brother?
We just stepped out of the shower.
He'll be down in a minute.
Listen, you guys can't go...
- Did you just say "we"?
- What?
Did you just say, "We just stepped out of the shower"?
I said "he."
Right.
Okay.
Listen.
I heard about the Coach Murray thing.
You guys cannot go to the police and say that he molested you.
- Why not?
- Because he didn't molest you!
That's true, but he's a dick, and we hated him.
- This is our chance for revenge.
You want in?
- No!
I think you do.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Ryan.
I don't know if you've been paying attention to the news recently... but there are millions to be made here, my friend.
Oh, sure, there's the classic route of priest molestation... but we thought we'd mix it up a bit.
We're going after the whole damn school board.
If you want in on the team, we could probably get a nice class-action suit going.
Okay.
Okay, first of all, there are people out there who actually have been molested.
And you guys are gonna exploit that for your own personal gain?
You assholes are securing your place in hell.
- We thought about it.
We're willing to roll the dice.
- I won't let you do it.
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- Oh, no, you won't, Charlie.
- Oh, yes, I will.
- Oh, my friend, I'm afraid not.
- And why not?
- We'll tell the cops the whole thing was your idea.
We should tell the cops that that fat dickhead gym teacher... we had in junior high molested us... and just sue the shit out of him!
- L...
I was joking.
- Really?
I'm not joking though.
I'm not joking.
I'm really not.
I wouldn't even joke about something like that.
We should do it.
I wanna do it.
Shit.
We'd hate to have to put this whole thing on your shoulders.
- Shit.
- So you're gonna have to keep your mouth shut.
You don't have to join us, but if anyone asks you point-blank...
Your ass got molested.
Otherwise, we're talking conspiracy charges.
And prison can be a bad place... for someone like you, Charlie.
A very bad place.
Soon as Charlie comes out, we gotta grab him, take him back to the bar... get him liquored up and tell him, "We know you got molested."
Gonna have to disagree with you, Sis.
I think we need to ease him into it.
There he is.
Okay, you know what?
Dr. Gainer used to say that in situations like this...
Dr. Gainer?
That guy was an idiot.
- He was not.
- Yes, he was.
- Talk about molesters.
That guy...
- He didn't molest me.
- I had sex with him 'cause I wanted to.
- You had sex with Dr. Gainer?
- Of course I did.
- No, you had...
Oh!
- He was a hot older man.
- Gross!
Okay.
You know what?
You have no room to talk.
All the girls you've molested.
Whoa, whoa.
Don't start throwing that word around like it's meaningless, okay?
- This is serious.
- Fine.
- Fine.
- Great.
Molester.
- Hey, Coach Murray!
- Yeah?
It's me...
Mac!
I don't know what this shit is all about.
One day the cops just roll into my classroom and they haul me out of there.
And they did it right in front of my kids too.
- Yeah.
Totally.
- Molestation?
I mean, please!
I got so much ass back in those days.
What the hell did I need that kind of shit for?
God, man, I hear you.
So much ass, it was like...
Whew.
Oh, and you know what, to tell you the truth?
I don't even remember who these assholes are that are accusing me.
- Nothing special there, right?
- I guess.
Nothing special.
You know, Coach, I've been working out a lot since grammar school.
- Good for you, son.
- Yeah, it's good for you, right?
You know when you get real tight, like, right up in here in this area here?
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.
Not here.
Like right in here.
What are you doing?
What do you want me to do?
All right.
L...
Okay.
- Oh!
- That's a good shot, bud.
Hey, tell me something, man.
What's been going on with you lately?
- You just seem...
- You know, um, I'm just distracted.
Is that why you ran out of the bar the other day?
No.
No.
I was...
I had some stuff I needed to do.
- It just popped in my head.
- Yeah, well, that's understandable.
- We've all got things that we have to do.
- Yeah.
What you running from, Charlie?
What?
- Dee, could you grab me a beer?
- Grab one yourself.
- I'm right in the middle of a game.
- Your game isn't working.
- Let me play now.
- Let me play the game the way I want to play it.
- Your way is dumb, and it's not working.
- Then we'll play your game.
It's not gonna get the results we want.
You're playing a game for children, and it's not working.
Charlie's not a baby.
Charlie!
Great.
Nice.
Good job, Dennis.
Great.
How are you gonna put this on me?
You messed it up!
- You messed it up!
- We have to push him!
Push him?
You're pushing him away.
Now he knows something's up.
- Good.
- Good?
Guys, I have good news!
I've been reading up on the subject of pedophilia.
It turns out that it isn't about sex after all.
It's about power.
So, the assailant doesn't go after the one he finds most attractive... this guy.
He goes after the weakest he can find.
Wow.
That is good news.
- Jesus, Mac.
What is wrong with you?
- No.
You're not following.
If Murray was looking for the weakest he could find, it wouldn't have been Charlie.
- Why not?
- Because Charlie was a bit of a psychopath.
When he got excited, his face would turn purple and he'd start biting things.
I don't think Murray would've put his dick anywhere near him.
- What about the McPoyle brothers?
- They were prime real estate.
- I'm sure he went to town on them.
- What's your point?
Charlie didn't get molested.
What?
- Good.
I'm sure he didn't.
- Oh, boy.
- I'm sure he didn't.
- Yeah.
Leave this to the two people that are qualified to deal with the situation.
It is cute that you did some research and got four books though.
- Nice work.
- Yeah, goodjob.
You know what?
We tried it your little tippy-toe pussy way.
That failed miserably.
So now why don't we try something that will work?
Look, I just want to say that I think this is a terrible approach.
You know how I already know that?
'Cause you keep saying it.
I keep saying it because... it is.
I'm sorry you're wrong about stuff all the time.
- I'm sorry that you're sorry all the time.
- What?
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I don't care.
- Well, hello, Dennis!
- Hi, Mrs. Kelly.
Don't you look so handsome!
- And, Dee, so beautiful.
- Thank you, Mrs. Kelly.
I'm sorry we had to stop by like this, but we really need to talk to you about something.
- What?
- It's about Charlie.
Oh, I can't believe this!
I just can't believe it!
Though I have to admit, it does explain a lot about him.
Yes, we were thinking the same thing.
Yes.
Oh.
Be strong, Bonnie.
Be strong for your little gingerbread man.
Now is not the time for an episode.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!
So, what do you need from me?
Hello?
Ma?
In here, Charlie!
Hey, I got your message.
You sounded kinda funny.
- Come on back, honey.
- Is everything all right?
Hello, Charlie.
Mom?
Grandma?
UncleJack?
What's...
What's everybody doing here?
Well, we've all gathered here at the request of your friends.
- Hey, bud.
- Hi, Charlie.
Hello, Charles.
L...
I don't exactly know how one of these things are supposed to go.
But we understand that there's been some abuse.
These two boys have been strong enough to admit what happened... and we thank you for that.
Just hope that that man goes away for a long, long time.
Prison can be a bad place for a guy like that.
Very bad place.
Now, we're not exactly sure how this thing is supposed to go.
But your friends have been helping us out... on a couple of key points.
Now?
Okay, Charlie, show us on the doll.
Show you what?
- Where he touched you.
- Oh, yeah.
Shall I turn it over?
Yeah, turn her over.
Do it.
Slow.
Slow.
- I think that went well.
- You did a wonderful job, Charlie.
- I really think they bought it.
- Oh, yeah.
Definitely.
I gotta say, my favorite part was at the end there when we were all hugging... and my sister screamed and told everyone that I touched her vagina.
Yeah!
So, Charlie... where to?
Oh, well, I was thinking we should, uh, zip down to the police station... file an official report.
- I gotta do it sometime, right?
- That's the spirit.
Let's get it on the books.
Excuse me.
I'd like to, uh, speak to a detective, please.
- Name?
- Charlie Kelly.
And what is this in reference to?
Sodomy.
Okay.
Uh, take a seat.
Someone will be right with you.
You're doing the right thing, Charlie.
The American school system's been oppressing people for years.
It's about time we start doing a little oppressing ourselves.
- That doesn't make sense.
- Yes, it does.
How are we oppressing anything?
You need to think before you speak.
- You do.
- Charlie Kelly?
Oh.
That's me.
Uh, I'll be right back.
Have a good time.
Twenty-five million is a lot of clams.
- Split it 50-50.
- Charlie's gonna want something.
How 'bout Charlie?
Yeah.
He'll want some.
He's not gonna get some.
We could always split it 50-50-50.
You even hear what you're saying?
Your gums are bleeding.
- How'd it go?
- Great.
I just ratted you out.
Can I see you two boys for a minute, please?
- So you're not gonna get in any trouble at all?
- Uh, no.
No, not really.
And since the McPoyles are gonna plead guilty, I'm off the hook completely.
- That's great.
- Sorry.
Was he saying that the intervention worked?
- No, I don't think that's what he's saying.
- What are you talking about?
It was the final push Charlie needed.
Turns out three-quarters of a major...
not so bad after all.
And the best part of it, actually, for me now is the fact... that everybody thinks that I've been molested.
So, in a way, my life is ruined.
In the meantime, I'm gonna go in the back office and cry and cry and cry... and drink for a while.
Emotional release.
- Another giant step forward.
- My God, we're good.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, so I just want to apologize again for the other day.
- It's all right, Mac.
Don't worry about it.
- Awkward, right?
You know what?
You were a good student at school.
You got potential.
- Just put that in your pocket.
- Really?
You mean that?
- I mean that.
- Great, Coach.
That's all I really needed to hear.
- Good.
- That is so great for me.
- Hey, say hi to those folks for me.
- I will.
Thanks.
All right.
That little prick's goin' to hell.
- On the side.
- You didn't do that on purpose.
- Otherwise that would have been a great shot.
- Watch this.
Side pocket.
- Holy shit!
- What?
"Christopher Murray, a teacher at St. Vincent's Elementary... has been accused of sexually abusing two former students."
- St. Vincent's?
That's that school you went to, right, Mac?
- Yeah, me and Charlie.
What else does it say?
"Murray has been the physical education teacher and boys' basketball coach for 25 years."
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Ah. "The accusers are two brothers whose names are being withheld...
"but the investigation will focus on the mid-1980s...
"as the time period for alleged abuse.
The police are hoping more young men will come forward."
- Wow.
That's horrible.
- Did this guy teach you guys?
- Yeah.
- No.
Yes, he did.
We were in the same class.
No.
Yeah.
Well, no, I didn't like it though.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I didn't like that class.
- What?
- I gotta go!
Holy shit.
Charlie got molested.
When dealing with molestation, the first step is always understanding.
So we need to take a moment and assess the situation.
Write this down.
What?
No, look.
First of all, we can't sit around and let him wallow in it.
And second of all, the first step is acknowledgment.
So I better write that down.
- No.
No, no.
- Whoa!
What, guys...
What the hell are you guys talking about?
Sweet Dee and I took psychology at Penn, so let the grown-ups talk.
- Okay?
Thank you.
- Okay?
Listen.
I think we need to have an intervention.
You know, bring his friends and family together for support.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Let's tell everybody Charlie knows that he got blown by a gym teacher.
Then we'll throw him a little surprise party, celebrate the occasion.
Okay, you know what?
You being a smartass... not helping Charlie.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who said anything about getting blown?
The article didn't specify what type of abuse it was.
It could have been anything.
Yeah, but do you think he got blown?
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you know?
Probably got blown.
Which is why I think you need to reconsider my idea.
Okay.
You know what?
Stop.
I'm sorry.
We need to clarify something here.
Do you think that Murray blew these guys?
Why are you so obsessed with the blowing aspect of all this?
Because I knew these two brothers that the article was talking about.
The McPoyle twins...
Ryan and Liam.
Okay?
They were the type of kids that would blow snot bubbles and rub 'em over each other.
They were gross, and they smelled like a couple of unwiped assholes.
So what?
Well, if Murray is, like, fondling or touching them, whatever...
I get it, all right?
But if he's dishing out blow jobs, come on.
- I just don't understand.
- What do you not get?
- What are you talking about?
- You're not getting this?
I was in that class with them, all right?
I was with those guys!
- Um, are you okay, dude?
- No, dude.
I'm not okay.
How come you're getting so upset?
The police are asking for more young men to come forward.
That means there are more guys out there who've been blown.
- What are you looking for?
- Photographs.
I have photographs.
- Oh, my God.
You have photographs of it?
- Oh!
Okay.
Listen, are you trying to say that you got molested?
Okay, look at this.
Look at this guy, huh?
I was cute.
I was energetic.
I was fun.
I mean, what exactly was this prick looking for?
- What are you...
- Sorry?
If the McPoyles got blown and Charlie got blown... then why didn't I get blown?
- You're goin' to hell, dude.
- Seriously.
Yo!
McPoyle!
Hey, open up!
Hey, Charlie.
Long time no see.
- What do you want?
- Is your brother here, man?
I gotta talk to you guys.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.
Come on, man.
I need to talk to you guys.
Go.
Move.
Go.
Go.
Come on.
- I'm not gonna walk in front of you!
Go.
- Just come in.
- No, you go first, and I will follow you.
- Shut the door.
I will shut the door.
- Whoa.
That was really weird.
- Yeah.
Well, this confirms it.
He definitely got molested.
Ugh.
We gotta get in there.
- Get...
We gotta get in there?
- Yes.
You can't just thrust yourself in the position of caregiver like that.
"Caregiver"?
Why are you throwing around big words?
- I actually majored in psych, so...
- You failed all your classes.
- So?
- I had a minor, and I passed all mine.
Well, you know what?
Three-quarters of a major is bigger than a whole minor.
- I don't even know how to respond to that.
- That doesn't surprise me.
Well, it shouldn't because what you said is really dumb, you know.
- That's a good one.
- Yeah, it is.
- That was good.
I liked that one.
- I felt good about it.
- So did you want a beverage of some kind?
- No!
Where's your brother?
We just stepped out of the shower.
He'll be down in a minute.
Listen, you guys can't go...
- Did you just say "we"?
- What?
Did you just say, "We just stepped out of the shower"?
I said "he."
Right.
Okay.
Listen.
I heard about the Coach Murray thing.
You guys cannot go to the police and say that he molested you.
- Why not?
- Because he didn't molest you!
That's true, but he's a dick, and we hated him.
- This is our chance for revenge.
You want in?
- No!
I think you do.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Ryan.
I don't know if you've been paying attention to the news recently... but there are millions to be made here, my friend.
Oh, sure, there's the classic route of priest molestation... but we thought we'd mix it up a bit.

- Another giant step forward.
- My God, we're good.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, so I just want to apologize again for the other day.
- It's all right, Mac.
Don't worry about it.
- Awkward, right?
You know what?
You were a good student at school.
You got potential.
- Just put that in your pocket.
- Really?
You mean that?
- I mean that.
- Great, Coach.
That's all I really needed to hear.
- Good.
- That is so great for me.
- Hey, say hi to those folks for me.
- I will.
Thanks.
All right.
That little prick's goin' to hell.
Hello?
your buddy.
How are ya?
I couldn't be... busier.
Doing what?
I'm...
I'm on this phone.
That's fair.
I'll call you back when you're not on the phone... when will you be not on the phone?
I'm not on the phone.
I'm talking to the phone.
That works.
it's me again.
still?
No.
Is that a yes?
It is?
Then yes.
I would not check my ice box.
either.
What's in there in the icebox?
Get on your little tiny mousey tiptoes.
Tell me what's in the icebox.
Hello?
Mouse? but Liquor said that Mouse is up to his cans.
WEYEeird.
right?
Like someone got him out.
And he got a thing for squirrels.
I'm not talking as though he's cheesy green up on 'em.
if you get the picture.
Pic-ture.
you know Roostre?
Up on the farm guy?
All right. clock shows up.
it's day 97.
GAs?
N-nothing.
EYE saw you crash.
cause you seem to see everything.
EYEfirmative.
and fly away.
But first-
Set up the cameras.
the only ones we have - the hidden ones.
Uh...
I'm still lookin at you not setting up the cameras.
just planning my day.
How long do you think I'll be watching you not do what I told you to do?
You kill trees.
Shut up.
Trees make oxEYEgen.
Up yours.
I breathe it; you breathe it.
I shut up; you shut up.
See it?
EYE see NEYEgh.
It was right F'n here.
and it was right the F here.
Uh huh.
EYE hungrEYE.
Good.
That means you're leaving.
That will happen... now.
Well.
The litte guy's cameraphobic.
Should've known.
or.. these papers.
These papers are driving me crazy.
Crazy into the night.
you're back.
Where've you been?
tell me about the nightmare.
Holy shee-
Go-damn.
Shark!
Rhoda?
um... sir.
Drink.
I'm a shark.
Uh... thank you.
I attack when I'm hungry.
It's instinctual.
You know?
mmhmm.
Th-thank you.
It's like one minute but you never know.
whatever.
and bam!
A thousand pounds of pressure lock in like a press.
You know what I mean?
and... thank you. and all I'd remember was how warm the juices were that lapped the back of my uvula on their trip down to stomach land.
sir.
right?
We know each other.
and what we say to them.
We do.
I knew we did.
momma.
Slap me a s-
Now let's talk about the letter that Liquor got.
but yet... and now I must burn them.
For a reason that...
I don't know.
your so yelling mouth.
We're gonna be rockstars.
we must burgle.
there's a pretty amp.
what song was that?
mmm-mmm.
Ro-ock and ro-ollll.
It's called "F-Off... to You." So take a hint.
No way!
That is... huh... a great song.
I'm here... somebody break in here?
it waasn't us.
I'm telling ya.
It is?
it is.
It'd sound great on my record label.
it should already be on it.
Where are we at on that?
You have a record label.
For... records?
let's tour.
dude.
pops.
Haha!
Zinger!
who broke in here now?
kid!
I never have to break in when I am in ma-nihm.
You know what I'm saying?
no.
My head!
Woah!
Is that ice cream?
Awesome. and now I am pleased to announce that I have... become a mosquito.
and I have even attached bladders to the nose things so I can suck up liquids when I puncture them... with my nose thing.
and you wouldn't even recognize me as your son-child.
mosquito.
000 dads because of the way I've designed the eyeballs.
but you wouldn't be able to understand my language because of its buzzing. but used for different reasons.
Hope you're doing well at camp.
Mosquithing...
I don't know who that is.
What's this?
F-Off.
Is it good?
Mmhmm.
So you've been making records?
No.
I've always kinda wanted to be in a band.
No way.
What do you play?
I play with minds.
Shhhhh.... and don't look under your bed.
Heylo?
Did you find my record?
didn't you?
Now spin it.

I listen to a boring song as I stare out the window
Let me don a dress and dance for you
Am I insane?
Please tell me
Someday, the wind will take me away
And now we can't remember it
Why don't I have wings to float in the sky, like the wind, like the clouds?
Why don't I have wings to sink into the all-enveloping night, like the stars, like the moon?
Ahh
It deflected my main cannon...
How can that be?
!
What is that?
!
A barrier.
Created by all the small machines surrounding it...
But that means none of our attacks will have any effect at all!
OI' Hugue's pretty good!
Now they're shooting all crazily!
I see!
They react to electrically-operated things, not living creatures!
Say what?
!
You mean they won't shoot people?
!
Well, I suppose you could say that.
Then that simplifies things...
Annoying flies.
W-what the hell?
!
New ones are comin' out!
What a predicament.
How are we supposed to-
This is Mary Spencer of the Albion Kingdom.
I'll lend support via transmission.
That airship is using a ferromagnetic shield system that the Methuselah's call "Aegis".
Aegis?
So that's what deflected my main cannon?
This Aegis deflects outside attacks, but I assume it needs to be lowered when launching an attack?
That's right.
Then we just need to blast it the moment its shield is down!
Judging from our data, that's for less than a second.
What's more, everything but front ahead to below remains shielded.
We will take care of the barrier!
Lawless people who harm others cannot be forgiven!
Sister Kate?
Sister Esther!
Go see him right away...
Eh?
Go see Abel...
Abel-niisan is dead...
You've really done it this time, Cain...
But...
I'm sure that he'll-
I sincerely pray this peace treaty will last for a long time.
I feel the same way.
By the by, I hear one of your priests passed away in Londinium...
Yes...
Yesterday, Father Nightroad, the one I had asked you to work with...
Say, where is the Count of Memphis?
Actually...
He just...
Yes.
It truly is Judgment Day.
Great judgment is about to be passed down for the dazzling new world that is coming.
The enormous power our Orden is now about to obtain will likely invite all life to the world of nothingness you wish for, my liege.
Damn!
If we don't do something, the next shot could take us out!
What's happening on your end?
!
Petros-kun and Paula-kun are standing by at the Tower Bridge.
I'll lend support from the riverbank!
OK!
I'm counting on you!
Yes.
The time has come!
EM pulse of differing waveform detected within the airship.
Iron Maiden, now re-charging main cannon.
Pulse collapse!
Light is being emanated!
EM wave levels around the ship dropping rapidly!
Now!
W-what?
!
Impossible!
Alright!
What?
!
Sir... 0400.
Now executing the Duchess of Milan's top orders.
Mission start.
Mission complete.
Father Tres!
What is that?
Moving object detected.
Distance: 57.89 meters.
Move.
Father Tres!
Esther, was it?
W-what more do you intend to do to Father Nightroad?
!
Don't worry.
We're going to become one.
After all, the two of us were originally one.
We have completely uniform genetic structures...
We are going to become one again and forever live together.
I will get a complete body, and Abel will no longer brood all the time.
He'll finally have eternal peace, inside of me...
What are you?
I am a Crusnik.
Something that needs nothing.
And, consequently, something that needs everything...
Now then, Abel...
Stay away!
Father...
I hear you quarreled again?
We should just ignore him!
He says rubbish!
Seth...
What did you do this time, Abel?
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."
The Earth would feel much better without those despicable people!
How can you say that, Abel?
!
They're people too, just like you!
Like hell we're the same!
We're guinea pigs.
Me, you, Cain, and Seth...
We were all created as expendables for the Mars Colonization Project!
What future can we possibly have?
!
Abel...
I'm happy.
I was able to be born into this world...
Cain...
No matter what environment you're born into, as long as you have the will, you can create the future you want.
Tell me, Abel.
What sort of future do you wish for?
I...
The future I wish for is...
You're going to continue to fight forever, aren't you?
Take this!
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, may there be eternal blessing for the new queen of Albion.
Eh?
!
For a new world...
For a world in which everyone can live together...
- Amen.
- Amen.
You're coming with me?
I am willing to sacrifice anything to destroy him now...
Are you prepared for that?
The enemy of the world...
Now that I know that it truly exists, I will fight alongside you.
No matter what dangers or trials lie in wait...
I see...
I absolutely cannot afford to lose...
=DS= 2006

START WALKING!
Hello, Mrs Raviage.
Have a good day.
- I was leaving.
- Can I give you these?
- I'll pop them in.
- Thanks.
What a downpour!
Have a good day.
I'll try.
Your mother's estate represents one million euros, plus her villa on the Riviera, worth 700,000 euros.
She donated her fortune, while alive, to a charity group.
So you inherit nothing.
However, there is a proviso.
Her estate will revert to you if, within five months of her demise, all three of you complete the pilgrimage to Compostella in its entirety, on foot, without ever separating, using the same accommodation.
Should you wish to,
I'll introduce you to your guide who has been selected by our firm and the charity.
Guy, would you come in, please?
Good morning.
I'm not a Christian.
Pilgrimages leave me stone cold and if some old bats prefer the Middle Ages, it's not my problem.
Plus, I'm in poor health.
I have an ulcer, high pressure and cholesterol.
So I can't walk anywhere, even for 15 minutes.
Man has invented machines from the wheelbarrow to the outboard motor so that we no longer need to lug backpacks along.
Third point, I run an important company.
I work from dawn till dusk.
I have duties, employees, homes, taxes, papers, responsibilities, a social life, social costs!
So you can stuff your pilgrimage!
I've always worked for the Secular School System.
I've fought prejudice, priests, obscurantism, pilgrimages and all the Church's underhand ways of nicking people's money.
Now I'm supposed to drag myself to Compostella?
With my brothers to boot?
Have you seen them?
An alcoholic on welfare and a success junkie!
Two months!
What do I tell my employer?
I'm off on a pilgrimage?
Just when Muslim headscarves are banned?
Who'll take care of my classes?
And who'll pay my salary?
What about my husband and kids?
I'm the only wage earner at home for the four of us!
But seeing as how I have the roof of the house to redo, my car to change, the dishwasher and the encyclopedias to pay off,
I'll cancel our summer holiday and I'll go on this rotten pilgrimage of yours because I need the money!
Are there any bars... on this Tomposquella thing?
I'm not going, I don't need the money!
How dare she force us to do this?
How dare she?
She's forcing me to do it.
I hate that!
Your sister's forcing you?
No, my mother!
My mother's forcing us with this rotten will!
Isn't she dead?
Even dead she does.
I won't go...
Now you've said you'll go, you have to go, don't you?
Yes, I have to go...
And stay in seedy hostels too!
But I'll stay in them because I won't pay for hotels for those two leeches.
Don't drink too much, honey.
You drink too much.
You won't drink when I'm away?
No, I won't drink.
Half an hour late, Dad.
I got stuck in traffic.
You don't drive.
The bus got stuck.
A whisky.
Make it a double.
Perrier and lemon.
Gran's dead.
I know.
You have to lend me 100 euros to catch a train.
I'll be rich soon.
I don't have 100 euros.
Ask your mum.
She won't lend you a quarter of a cent.
Can you pay for that whisky?
No, but let me explain.
There's a will.
Your gran...
Mingo, where's the big backpack?
On the couch, I've packed ii.
I used the list.
You still need soap.
I'll get some tomorrow.
Lucie, get the bread, please.
Want to take all this?
Lucie...
Pierrot...
Okay, honey?
Along the Way
Thank you.
- Leave the mobile on.
- Mobile on.
- My pills are in the pack?
- In the pack.
- You're Pierre?
- That's right.
- And your sister is...
- Clara.
"Along the Way"?
Le Puy to Santiago.
Camille?
No, Mathilde...
Excuse me, sir.
Hello.
"Along the Way", right?
Saiid Keifa and my cousin Ramzi_
You're here.
Good.
Meet Mathilde...
Pierre...
Clara...
Is anyone else coming?
Yes, another three
Okay...
And what are their names?
We have Claude, Elsa and Camille.
I know a Camille.
We know a Camille, right, Saiid?
Her mum's headmistress at his school.
We know one.
Saiid, look over mere.
That's the Camille we know!
Why are you here?
No reason.
Just travelling.
- Okay, Ramzi?
- Yeah, great.
We're on a pilgrimage to Mecca.
- Where?
- Traveling too?
I'm doing a hike with my friend Elsa.
Elsa, this is Saiid
- The Saiid who...
- Yes!
...Wanted the address for "Along the Way"?
I wanted a hiking trip company.
You had her number?
- Camille?
- "Along the Way"?
That's right.
This is Elsa.
Clara, can you help me out till we inherit?
I ran out of cash for the train fare so I took a cab for the last leg:
210 euros.
It's waiting outside.
I'm in the Shit.
I'll pay you back...
Hey, if I don't come, you won't inherit either.
.Just 210 euros.
Give me 250 and I won't ask again until...
Read my lips.
Not a cent.
You can go to hell.
Just a second.
Can you help me out?
I took a cab and...
Here!
Take 250 euros!
Here's 300.
Does 300 euros suit you?
Cut the crap, pay the cab and go!
Just go!
Here, I've got it.
- It was 2107
- That's right.
- There.
- Shall we go?
See you.
I have to go.
Bye.
I'm going too.
Have a good trip.
We're with "Along the Way".
He's our guide.
No, he's ours.
He's going to Santiago, not Mecca.
- So are we.
- Where?
Santiago de Mecca.
You going too?
To Santiago, yes.
The chicks are going to Santiago de Mecca too.
Cool!
Saiid loves you.
He says you're hot.
Cut the crap!
Is Elsa coming with us too?
She's hot.
This is cool.
What the hell's going on?
Here is Le Puy's Madonna with Christ in her womb.
She's a black Madonna.
So?
What's the big deal?
She has jungle drums?
Are you Catholic?
No, I'm not.
Is that a problem?
Your religion's racism.
Mine's Islam, especially my mum.
Go to a mosque, in that case.
We're going.
We're off to Santiago de Mecca.
For the new pilgrims,
I'll give you our blessing shortly, after we get acquainted.
Introduce yourselves and say where you're from and where you're going.
Look at him with his handmaidens
The Catholic Church!
A huge club for paedophiles and submissive women.
They ban condoms, causing 50 million deaths from Aids but old Pope-y doesn't give a shit.
He wags his cross, rakes in the dough and his bankers get rich.
Place your prayers in this urn to be read at mass.
You have paper here too.
Then get your credentials from the sacristy.
Travel safely.
God be with you.
A Nahu akbar!
Credentials cost three euros.
Put down today's date.
What're you writing?
A prayer to say for me later.
Do one for me?
What'll I put?
Pray to help my mum pay her rent because she paid for her son's trip to Santiago de Mecca.
Go on.
I'm asking for help with the month's rent.
Compostella is that way.
"Pray for me, my mother died.
"Pray that my pupils will get by.
"Pray for my husband to find work because the dole
"will end up killing him." Well?
- No idea.
- We strike out "dole"?
Yes, no politics.
"Pray for my husband..."
Then what?
"Who is ill."
He's not, he's on the dole.
- Same thing.
- Not yet.
Will be soon.
Just the start.
"Pray for me, my mother died"?
"For my mother".
"For me" is selfish.
"Pray for my mother".
In capitals.
Father Dumas is as blind as a bat.
"Pray Ramzi will write one day.
"Pray his mum can pay her rent
"after I took her savings to go to Santiago de Mecca
"with Ramzi.
"Pray she won't kick my ass.
And pray that the girl I love will love me loo."
Santiago de Mecca?
Odd...
- Bin it?
- Bin it.
"Pray my cancer stays away and my husband ion."
Cancer, fine, but the husband...
No "husband"?
I hate doing this.
We can't pray at mass for a husband to stay away.
Maybe he's a moron.
Maybe he caused the cancer.
Maybe.
So what do we do?
"Pray for me to get better, pray for my family."
- How'll you manage?
- I need a backpack?
I gave you a list.
- You did?
- Yes, at the solicitor's.
I gave all three of you a list.
Maybe...
I know I did.
It's a two-month trip.
You have to have a backpack.
There's stuff you need.
Your shoes are bad enough...
They're great trainers.
I've had them four years.
Got any rain gear?
Or clean underwear?
Can't I get that on the way?
Claude, we'll be on hiking in the middle of the countryside.
You won't find many Woolworth's around.
Maybe someone can lend me stuff?
How come we're the only Arabs here?
We're not.
Look at her, she's wearing a headscarf
Shouldn't there be more Arabs going to Santiago de Mecca?
No way!
These days, everyone goes.
What's so good there?
No one pays rent, it's sunny every day, life's good, you work a little, then rest, a lot, everyone can read, even the dumb ones...
No need to tell me I'm dumb.
- I never said that.
- You did!
I said everyone can read, that's all.
Maybe someone there can teach you.
Besides, who's bothered?
Who's bothered if a guy can't read?
My mum.
Robert, are you there?
Get a move on!
Ask for directions.
It's the Compostella trail.
Hurry, I've had all I can take.
It's so steep...
Look at that idiot glued to his phone.
That's my brother.
He's buying stock market shares.
Do you hike a lot?
Yes, I do.
But lately I've been...
Look at him!
Unbelievable!
He wasn't buying shares, he was calling his chauffeur!
The sly devil's using his BMW!
I Saw you put that pack in your Car, blockhead!
A tiny backpack's too heavy?
You wimp!
- Wait for me at the top.
Shut it, you fat cow!
Stop that!
Cut it out.
Get out of the way!
Let go of her.
You're crazy.
Stop ii!
That's enough!
Cut it out!
You don't fight like that!
I won't be your guide in these Conditions!
Go ahead and sulk, but no fighting!
I have a group to lead here.
People have paid for that.
And no one messes around, okay?
What do we do about food?
Wow, you're in shape.
I guess...
So what's all this about Mecca?
Ramzi thinks we're walking to Mecca.
We're not going to Mecca!
His mum sent him to learn to read.
He won't learn to read in Mecca.
Exactly.
- Exactly what?
- Exactly.
We're not going there.
But he thinks he is.
Yes, but he's kind of...
You know...
Retarded?
No,just naive, if you like.
He isn't I could teach him to read in no time.
That would be great.
Why are you going to Santiago?
I know someone there.
Who?
Someone.
How did you hear about this?
My uncle paid for us to come for graduating
Hey, Mr Guide!
How long have we walked?
- Two hours.
- When do we eat?
In an hour.
No way!
I want to eat now.
Want a rest?
- A drink?
- Got a glass?
- Got water?
- Have you?
- Yes.
Why?
- For me.
Know that hill earlier?
Who carried the water up it?
You, Pierre, you're strong, nothing resists you, you always succeed.
I admire you, Pierre.
Fuck you.
- Lend me a condom?
If you could communicate without insults,
I think we'd all appreciate it.
For 10 weeks...
- I talk how I want.
The will doesn't say I can't answer him.
No, but answering isn't the same as insulting...
Nor my sister.
I'll belt you if you do.
I have today's lunch:
rice salad with tuna...
- Watch it!
- ."cheese, olives and a cake.
I'll pound you to a pulp, you prat.
We'll picnic in an hour...
Prat yourself.
- ...
In a lovely spot.
However, from tomorrow on, you'll carry your own food.
Rule number 1: we carry our own shit.
- ...our own gear.
- Exactly.
- Thank you!
You're a paragon of our educational system.
I'll note that:
we carry our own shit.
Stop arguing.
Big mistake...
Never give in with him.
He deals in vacuum cleaners.
He's going to suck you dry.
Manager's a stressful job.
- Who for?
- For you...
I'm not a manager.
I take it easy.
My brother Pierre is the manager.
I'm unemployed.
You were laid off?
I've never worked.
I've always drunk.
An alcoholic living on welfare.
That's a pretty scarf.
It suits you...
When do we see cows?
There are some beauties coming up.
They look like they have kohl around their eyes.
The cows wear kohl?
They look like they do.
- Will we see sheep loo?
- Yes, loads...
Only natural, with Id coming up.
- What?
- Id, at the end of the pilgrimage.
I don't know if they're used for Id but...
They are, my mum told me.
If your mother told you...
- I didn't know.
- What's this about Mecca?
I've no idea.
He got the money from Ramzi's mother...
Ramzi's retarded, right?
No, he's just a little... naive.
He wants to learn to read.
He can't read?
Does Saiid love you?
- How should I know?
- Is he still your big love?
Love?
What is love?
I don't believe in love.
- I don't have a dish.
- So you don't eat.
Tell me, my good fellow, how long do we walk after lunch?
Four hours or so.
We're walking another four hours?
Seven hours today?
It's the daily average.
The daily average?
Not for me, old chap.
What's the hotel like?
It's not a hotel, it's a hostel.
What's the difference with a hotel?
The price.
Look at the cows!
Beautiful, huh?
I don't believe ii, all these cows...
I'm short of breath.
It'll get easier tomorrow.
I doubt it.
Come on!
.Just one more hour to go!
Raymonde, are you here?
It's Guy.
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.
And you?
The boys sleep downstairs, the girls upstairs.
Four girls and five boys.
Is that okay?
Five boys, no.
I only have four free beds in the boys' dorm.
One will have to sleep with the girls.
Can you tell him?
- I'll see to it.
- Thanks.
Hello.
The boys' dorm is full.
You'll have to sleep with the girls upstairs.
See you later.
Ladies...
I've brought some special cream for sensitive skin.
Mine gets really dry, you know.
I'll go and shower.
- Where's the soap?
- You've got it.
I've got ii.
I'll shower.
Don't get the soap all mushy.
- No room.
- Let's use the stones.
Good idea, the sun was on them all day.
Okay?
It's nice now.
No washing?
I don't have anything.
You've changed your scarf.
That one suits you too.
So, how do you like the hostel concept?
- We really get unlimited wine?
- Yes.
Stuff yourself with bread instead of wine.
You're right.
I may as well.
That's the only stuffing I'll get tonight.
Notice my brothers subtlety.
A true poet.
Has everyone found a bed?
In the women's dorm.
You could have booked ahead.
Sorry, hostels are first come, first served.
- Anarchy.
- That's when he isn't served first.
- Shut it!
- YOU first.
Are your feet okay?
- Mine are dead.
- My back is hell.
- Is your pack too heavy?
- No idea.
It should be a fifth of your weight.
16 pounds maximum.
Is mine too heavy?
No, yours isn't.
Could you step outside while we undress?
Of course, no problem.
It's okay.
Yes, I can talk, they're in bed.
I'm making tomorrow's lunch.
It's the first day.
They're all worn out.
No, not too bad.
Although the brothers and sister fight all day.
How about you?
Damn...
How high?
You called the doctor?
The emergency one.
Don't panic, we'll find a solution.
I'm 300 miles from home...
What can I possibly do?
It's not the same as usual.
I'm not letting you down.
Claudine, call Fred.
He's around.
He can take her to the hospital for you.
Maybe his mother can look after Coralie and Pierrot.
Claudine, what can I do?
Don't yell at me.
I'm doing what I can.
You're stuck with the kids but my job feeds you.
Call Fred, he's a good friend.
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
My kid's sick.
- What's wrong?
- No idea.
A high temperature it's tough when they're sick and you're away.
You can come back in now!
- Lights out?
- Yes, go ahead.
Just a minute...
Good night, everybody.
Quiet, let the girls sleep!
Didn't you do Belle-Ile with Fred?
No, I did the Ardéche with Fred.
Two years ago.
He mentioned a Mathilde_ So that was you.
Fred's a good friend of mine.
A great guide.
Yes, and good-looking with it.
Very.
Are you really a teacher?
Yes, of literature.
Do you know how to teach people to read?
No, I work in a high school, not a primary school.
Can't you all teach people to read?
I don't have the patience.
It's a vocation.
A voc-what?
A gift.
It's tough in some classes.
That's true.
My cousin Ramzi has been in those classes.
- For dicsekcits.
- Dyslexics.
Those who read wrong.
Some can't read at all.
That's right, not a thing.
They can't even recognize an A.
If they see an A, they have no idea what it is.
It's a handicap.
Like Ramzi's mum says,
Ramzi has to learn to read.
He has to.
But saying it is easy.
Doing it is tough.
So Ramzi can't read?
No, not a word, I swear.
He can't even read "exit" in the metro!
That's bad.
Maybe someone could teach him as we go along.
That's a good idea...
You, for instance!
No, not me...
I deal with troubled kids all year long.
I teach grammar, creative writing, the life of Rousseau and 17th century poetry.
It's damn hard but I do it.
And I get them interested.
But teach the illiterate to read, I can't do that.
We carry our own sh... cross.
Do you hike often?
Hike?
Not often, no.
My first time.
I'm not fit.
- Me neither.
- But you're young.
- You too.
- Not for much longer.
Why are you going there?
Me?
To get my mother's money.
Mum was senile.
Alzheimers.
She's dead now and, to inherit, the three of us have to go to Santiago.
Your mum's dead?
Yes, a month ago.
Your mum died a month ago!
You must be so sad!
I sorry I asked.
I didn't know.
Shit, that's tough, losing your mother...
I can't even imagine ii.
- Got any water?
- No room with the picnic.
Same here.
You chicks okay?
Stop calling us chicks.
Tough climb, huh?
No, you think so?
Got any water?
Damn, it's empty.
Ramzi, got any water?
Yeah, I hardly drink.
Carry on, I have to slip away.
Slip away?
- She's having a pee.
- The slipper way.
Lost your fancy plate?
Excellent beans, old chap.
- Old chap?
He's Guy.
- What?
To act superior, try "my boy".
He's younger.
And more handsome.
- Want a fight?
- Want a tomato in your face?
Will you stop fighting?
We can't have three months of this.
- It's getting to be a pain.
- They'll calm down.
I put up with it 16 years, then I got out fast.
You're an ace at getting out of things fast.
Ask your wife and kids.
Leave my kids be.
Like you do.
Except to borrow money.
Belt up.
That's a weak reply.
Try using that pickled pea of a brain.
- Is it some kind of match?
- Shut up.
Stop this and just grow up.
Do the food and don't lecture us!
Don't talk to him like that!
Insult Guy and I'll see red too!
I didn't pay to walk with racists!
Didn't your uncle pay?
Who asked you?
Got a problem?
Hey, I don't have a problem.
But if I'm a problem, say so.
She didn't mean anything!
He was just saying it's okay.
He was trying to be nice.
Racist is okay?
There are no racists here...
Really?
No racists here?
"Old Chap, my boy, do the food." And you just sit there!
Calm down, girls, and have a nap.
Siesta time, chicks.
A PMT pill for your nerves?
Why bother to defend people?
They only treat you like Shit.
He's for no-waves integration in a PC world.
Not quite, ma'am.
I've got three kids to feed.
I'm going, I can't take this.
It's all right.
It's 'cause their mum died.
She died a month ago.
They feel bad.
If you lost your mother, you'd have feeled bad too.
I lost my mother 20 years ago.
This is the desert.
We're crossing the desert.
All those cows with kohl we saw...
I've been trying the slipper way but it's tough here.
- What?
- The slipper way.
Keep going.
Don't look.
You want to slip away.
- You want to slip away.
- No, you do.
He murders the French language.
After all I've done for you.
- What did you say?
- Nothing.
You said something.
What have you done?
- Saying I was a problem...
- I didn't.
You shouldn't say that.
You shouldn't have said my uncle paid for this.
I didn't mean anything.
You're not a problem for me.
I took Ramzi's mum's money.
You shouldn't have done that.
Maybe it was her savings.
It was to be with you.
What will we tell her after?
She'll rip my head off.
I may as well leave for Mozambique.
Plus he won't learn to read.
You're in big trouble.
I asked Clara, that teacher, but she won't do it.
- She Says diskekcits are a vocation.
- Dyslexics.
Two months with you, but you couldn't care less.
I hope it works.
I have calls to make!
I can't go without a phone like this!
Don't worry, there's a phone booth at the hostel.
Is that the hostel?
Will we all fit in?
- We get dinner?
- A good one.
Josette brings it up.
- Where's the booth?
- Under that tree.
There's no phone booth!
There's a connection.
You didn't let me know, Robert!
I want you to set up my mobile office for me or...
What?
Good hotels, everything's fine.
No, don't send me anything!
No, we don't stop off at post offices!
No, Mum, I don't need anything.
I had to dump half of my stuff!
But, Mum, it's not material things I need!
I didn't get the message!
You can't reach me.
There's never any connection here!
The cleaning woman called you?
She's at the clinic?
Why is she in hospital?
There's no fever with asthma.
Where are the other two?
Why are they with Fred's mum?
And where's Fred?
He's at our place?
Why hasn't he gone home?
Let your brother watch a DVD on Friday.
It's not your computer.
It belongs to us all.
Put your father on.
I don't want Lucie taking over the computer.
I'm okay.
Yes, we fight.
They're foul.
The days are long, my feet ache.
The scenery?
You think I care?
I don't even look at ii.
Call Ramzi's mum.
Saiid's credit has run out.
Mum, call her to say they're okay.
Go back to see her.
Yes, now.
Leave me messages.
Get going, Robert.
I have to get our meal ready.
I'll leave you to ii.
- Good night to both of you.
- Hurry, Robert.
- Hello, Josette.
- Hello, Guy.
- Are you well?
- It's good to see you.
In shape?
- I've brought dinner.
- Great.
Get your credentials stamped here.
Let's use the stones.
This is an A, okay?
Two slanting bars and a crossbar:
A.
This a B, okay?
A bar and two bellies.
B, okay?
If I put B in front of A, that makes BA.
So this is?
See, you can read if you understand that.
- I can't read everything.
- You can.
This is the basic idea.
After you have C, a crescent moon.
C is "ke".
What does C in front of A make?
C in front of A?
C, Well "ke".
We Call that letter C but pronounce it "ke" with certain vowels.
In front of others, it's "se".
And in front of an H it's "sh".
Like Chicago.
So, C in front of A?
Crescent moon with two slanting bars.
That makes...
- Ca.
See?
- Okay.
Now, Ba in front of Ca, what does that make?
- What was this one?
- Ba.
- And the other?
- Ca.
What a jerk, you just said.
That makes...
Gabe.
Almost like casbah!
No, not Caba, it makes Baca.
The Ba was in front of the Ca.
Right, Baca...
What does Baca mean?
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just to show you how words are put together.
There was no hot water earlier!
That's normal.
Our electricity comes from the solar panel that you saw when you arrived.
In fact, there are no sockets to recharge your mobiles.
They were right here!
I've lost my pills.
It's a disaster!
- Where are they?
- I forgot them.
- Where?
- On the trail.
How did you do that?
I ditched a load of stuff and threw them out too.
You ditched a load of your stuff?
Too heavy, was it?
- Shut up.
- Is it serious?
If I skip them just once, I'm finished.
Was it before or after lunch?
- Before.
- You didn't take them at midday?
No, I didn't.
I forgot.
What do you want to do?
- Go back.
- That's impossible now.
.
Why?
- It'll be dark soon.
It's a four-hour walk.
Fine, no one gives a damn about me.
I'm off to bed.
Doesn't look bad for a finished guy.
What does he take?
Stuff to make his life bearable.
I don't want to disturb you.
There.
Shit!
It's you.
I'm not in a coma anymore.
I'm going home tomorrow.
Roberts coming for me.
Yes, I'll say hello to the nurses you know.
I won't drink again, I promise.
Don't go, please.
- I'd like to go.
- You're all I have.
It's so long.
It's too long.
I'll call tomorrow.
How about you?
16 and 17, a boy and a girl.
That's a great age.
You get on with yours?
We get on really well.
We adore each other.
She lives with you?
Her mother and I separated a long time now.
- And you?
- Same here.
But not so long ago.
These posts are odd.
They're beautiful.
Yes, they are.
- This is nice.
- Yes, it is.
Life is rarely nice.
But this is nice.
I can't hear you, Robert!
She's out of the coma.
Go and pick her up.
Don't talk, Robert, I can't hear you!
I can hear you a little.
We need a full assessment.
- Are you rich?
- Yes, I think so.
Do you have a house in the country?
Yes, I do.
- How many cars?
- Three, I think.
- Three cars?
- And a 4x4 for the Alps.
- What Alps?
- When we go skiing.
- D'you ski often?
- In winter, yes.
Is skiing good?
- Yes, but I'd get bored.
.
Why?
- As a kid, I always had a key on me.
- What key?
To our apartments.
Mum was never in.
Only the maid was there.
You had a maid?
A Spanish housekeeper.
- You liked her?
- A lot, she was a mother to me.
Are your parents nice?
They're separated.
But you're rich though.
Money-wise, yes.
She's a headmistress
So your mother teaches.
- But I don't want to.
- Good.
Why?
Sorry, but I overheard your reading lesson.
Not exactly brilliant.
You'll turn Ramzi's brain to mush.
He won't even learn to read his name that way.
I was using intuition.
You can't really use intuition with dyslexics.
Okay, Saiid'?
No, I've got a blister.
Well, blisters...
You're not glad I'm here.
What?
I am glad!
You don't give a damn.
That's not true!
I may as well not be here.
Come on, spit it out.
Spit what out?
You want sex, is that it?
No, I feel good with you.
Did you ask me my opinion?
Well, I didn't do this to end up with pals from school.
I'm just a pal from school?
For me, you're not just any girl.
I don't want to fill my head with complications, okay.
What's so complicated?
I'm hot for you.
But I'm not.
There's too much to set straight.
Such as?
You're invading my space!
This topic doesn't interest me!
We'll lose the others.
.Just get off my back, that's all!
I'll get off your back!
But tell me what you want to set straight.
Nothing!
You said you did.
What am I?
The battery driving you?
How are the reading lessons going?
Great, just great...
- Good, I'm glad.
- Me too.
Saiid told me about your mum.
What did he say?
She'd love you to learn to read.
That's true.
She'll be pleased.
It's really hard for me, you know.
I'm not only dysclexlic, I'm dumb too.
- Dumb?
- Yes, dumb.
There are ways of teaching anyone to read.
- Even retards?
- You're a retard?
Ways like Camille's?
No, not at all.
Her way's getting me confused.
Don't tell her though.
I don't understand, see.
- I'm all mixed up.
- Give it time.
No, whenever they teach me, my brain turns to couscous.
Do you have a better way?
We can try.
Don't tell Camille.
Did he talk to you?
And?
- He says he's hot for me.
- And?
- And nothing.
- You said you love him?
- Are you nuts?
.
Why?
I can't just tell him.
You've been in love with him for ages!
- You frame his love notes!
- Bullshit!
You talked to her?
- Yeah, I talked to her.
- And?
It's wild.
- She loves you?
- Hold your horses.
You've loved her ages.
Women require patience, see.
I'm cool.
I'm not pressuring her.
There's stuff we need to set straight.
There's no rush.
You sure know how to handle women.
I'm sick of it!
Stop!
Stop!
Are you okay?
No, I'm not okay.
I'm sick of this, I'm too tired!
I've lost my pills!
I quit.
I'm going home.
Goodbye!
Stop!
Where are you going?
Where are you off to?
I don't want to climb a hill ever again!
- What?
- I'm sick of it!
I can't go on.
It's too steep.
My heart can't take ii.
You can't leave.
I'm responsible for all of you!
I'm leaving, okay!
It's steep, my wife's sick and I need my pills!
She's sick?
She drank herself into a coma!
I'm going crazy!
No one talks to me and I'm beat!
Your hills are killing me!
You love us to suffer as you speed along!
You find it funny, you ape!
No, it's not funny!
I want to go home too!
My kid's in hospital, my wife's cheating on me, and I'm going crazy with people so self-centered they can't even see the beauty around us!
Are you dumb, Ramzi?
Are you dumb, Ramzi?
Are you dumb, Ramzi?
You're not dumb.
You're not dumb at all.
I don't think you are.
And since you're not dumb, let's begin.
Can you speak No 2 French?
What's that?
No 1 French is what you use at home with your family, your friends...
No 2 French is what helps you get a job, write, speak on TV...
Rich people use it to say, "We're better than the poor."
You need to learn.
I won't know how.
You're underdeveloped.
No, I'm not.
You're not?
Okay, you're not.
So you can learn No 2 French to fuck the rich people.
"Fuck" isn't No 2 French.
Sorry, I won't use "fuck" again in our lessons.
I'm going to learn No 2 French to bother those who say, "We're better."
"Bother" isn't as good as "fuck".
We need a word that's as good as "fuck"
but that's No 2.
To screw?
No, No 1.
To piss off?
No good either.
That's good.
But it's No 1.
To upset, annoy, irritate, aggravate, torment, tease, infuriate, anger, fight, needle...
There are plenty of words.
Which do you prefer?
- I preferate "fight".
- Not "preferate", Ramzi...
I know, I was just kidding.
How does it go with "fight"?
I'll learn No 2 French to fight those who say,
- "We're better than the poor."
- Right on.
What are you interested in?
- Football.
- Okay.
What word do you want to read?
- The word "football".
- All right.
The word "football".
It's not simple.
It's English.
Let's try another word.
Corner.
No, not corner.
- Goal?
- Now then, goal...
They're all English words!
Showing me you know English inside out?
I don't know English!
How about "boots with studs"?
Will that do?
Want to learn the word "stud"?
How about Zidane or Ronaldo?
Let's try Zidane, then.
That begins with a Z.
Z: the last letter in the alphabet.
- The alphabet is...
- Zidane's first at football.
See, sometimes the last end up first.
Not that often.
Sometimes though.
Once is enough.
- Enough for what?
- To keep hoping.
- Hope sucks.
- Fuck you!
What's hope?
We'll write it, then talk about it.
Hope...
We leave in 20 minutes.
What's today's schedule, Guy?
Walking, walking and walking.
When you get back, how will you show your mum you can read?
I want to write her a poem.
Dear...
Mum.
I see you everywhere I go.
Lemon...
- This?
- No, that gives you wind.
Chocolate...
Chocolate melts in the packs.
How about crisps?
Let me see.
Flavouring E621, anti-caking agent E551, citric acid E33O...
- Perfect for you!
- We'll take them?
Want food poisoning?
- What'll we eat, then?
- Vegetables.
There's not a single bed left.
- Can we eat?
- I'm afraid not.
You could try the priest.
He has a big place.
No, I don't have room for nine people!
How many could you take?
No one.
I can't put you up.
Isn't this place big?
Yes, it is big.
It's late, we don't know where to go.
The school keys!
Use a classroom.
There's water and toilets in the yard.
We can sleep on boards.
Lie them down on the floor.
- Can I sleep here?
.
Why?
I always sleep on this side, that's why.
Pain in the ass.
I'm hungry.
We're hungry.
What do we eat?
Dried apricots 14 of them.
- A tomato.
- I'll have it.
You can't sleep here!
- Hold the door, there's no bolt.
- Hurry!
This is the only one that works!
Hey!
Stop snoring!
I don't believe ii!
It's freezing.
Stop snoring!
I can't take any more.
I'm too cold!
There's a connection!
I've got a message.
Mum can't reach Ramzi's mum.
She never answers.
Can she keep trying?
My battery's dead.
Wea...ther.
Weather.
The weather.
The weather tomorrow, for instance.
Why's there an "a" in there?
You often get extra letters.
Okay without your pills?
I get palpitations.
You're walking well.
You hardly noticed that last hill.
Sometimes, you feel better without the pills.
Look.
What does that say?
Drin-king wa-ter.
Meaning?
Meaning you can drink ii.
- I'm having a rest.
- Good idea.
"To our son."
"To our son."
- Poor guys...
- What?
They lost two sons, young kids.
These lost a baby.
There are photos.
It was long ago and we don't know them anyway.
- Hello, Guy.
- Father Sébastien
- Good to see you.
- The hostel is full...
- and I thought...
- It's full?
- How many in your group?
- Nine?
Everyone wants to sleep?
Have you eaten?
It won't... it should be possible.
Bread salad and tomatoes.
- Yes.
- We can help.
No.
I'd be glad... if you could help because, well..
No, Ramzi!
What are you doing with the dough?
Careful.
Your pastry cook is...
pretty good.
What did Ramzi say at the cemetery?
He was talking about the dead...
Had you read the gravestones for him?
You didn't read anything?
So he read them!
- What?
- He read the gravestones himself.
He can't read.
I stopped teaching him ages ago.
He just looked at the photos.
- Want another?
- Yes.
Thanks.
Where's Claude?
He was just behind us.
Mathilde, have you got any change?
I can't seem to find my money.
- How much is it?
- A double whisky, eight euros.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.
Goodbye.
- Hey, girls, any connection?
.
No.
Why?
We wanted the match score.
2-1 for Marseille.
- I don't believe it...
- Fantastic!
How do you know?
- Can you read?
- No, not at all.
Well, a little.
- You can read a little?
- I can just not read a little.
Don't tell Camille.
She'll get upset.
Excuse me, is the hostel open?
Yes, it opens in a quarter of an hour.
Okay.
Can I buy you a drink?
No thanks, I've just had a drink.
Is that your pack?
You can't do the trail with that thing.
I've walked a month already.
That's pre-war gear...
Where did you Start from?
I start here.
The Spanish part's the best.
- The French part's good too.
- No idea.
What time do you set off?
Around eight...
I leave at five to get to the next hostel early.
We take our time in our group...
Old folks slowing you down?
Young and old...
I hate groups.
I see it more as a solitary challenge, an endurance test.
Pack not too heavy?
No way!
I got the latest, ultra-light gear.
Good idea.
Mine was too heavy.
I had shampoos, creams and stuff.
I had to dump the lot.
Girls...
Creams and shampoos!
You don't need anything.
In skimpy shorts, any pilgrim would be glad to carry you.
Grannies are different but you...
How about dinner?
If you like.
Why not?
What do you do for a living?
I'm an executive.
France Telecom.
Company relations, management of communication plans...
Huge responsibilities.
- What about you?
- I'm a student.
Good.
Can I take your photo for my album?
If you want.
Is it time to go?
No, go back to sleep.
It's not time yet.
Who is this shithead?
What time is it?
4:30.
You've gotta be joking.
- He's crazy.
Moron!
- What 3 jerk!
In the middle of the night...
The windcheater and the shoes.
Can't he shut his trap?
You could at least respect other people's sleep!
Who'll get to the next hostel first?
Rise and shine, you idlers!
Lots of love, Elsa!
- You know that moron?
- I don't know him!
Behind you, you have the French trail, ahead of you the Pyrenees and then Spain.
Clara, Claude and Pierre, your mother's will stipulated that if you walked to St Jean-Pied-de-Port, you could stop here.
You've done that.
You'll inherit now.
The journey's over for you.
So I'll say goodbye and good luck.
Despite the fights, it was a pleasure.
You mean we've finished?
We can go home?
- Yes.
- We've finished the pilgrimage?
Yes, you can go home.
Fantastic...
No hard feelings?
Claude...
Pierre, goodbye.
Let's get going now, it'll be quite a climb.
- What's up?
- I'm carrying on.
- Carrying on?
- The trail.
- Where to?
- Santiago.
- But why?
- I'm not stopping in the middle.
The middle of what?
Take your bus and your money and go.
You're walking to Santiago?
I feel good walking.
I'm not sick now.
I want to see Santiago.
It's only a cathedral.
France has cathedrals too!
Take your bus.
Get going.
I don't need you!
Trying to prove you're better than us?
That you do what Mum wanted?
Sure...
.Just give me a break, will you?
I do nothing good.
My life is a disaster.
No love.
Just a suicidal alcoholic I'm trying to help!
Don't I have the right to live?
Get off my back!
I'm not trying to prove anything for once.
I just want to feel good with others.
Everybody loves you.
Women love you.
What more do you want?
Camille, look...
Some woman's given up already.
After just two hours!
Am I seeing things?
That's not a woman!
it's my France Telecom guy.
Incredible!
Something wrong?
I'm going back.
.
Why?
- A taxi's coming to take me back.
- What happened?
- I'm all white.
If I talk, I'll puke.
This pilgrimage is shit.
Maybe you set off a little too quickly.
It's really tough at first.
This walking thing is for jerks.
Hey, isn't that Pierre coming up?
He's got Claude and Clara with him!
Okay?
You're carrying on, then?
I am.
I don't know about them.
We're carrying on too!
- A problem?
- He's going home, he feels rough.
- Need anything?
- No, I'm okay...
We'll be going.
We've got a lot on.
All the best from grandpa.
- From grandma too.
- All the best from the jerks.
What an idiot I am!
"All the best from grandpa." I Should have kept my big mouth Shut.
Grandpa is totally wiped out now, like a real old grandpa!
I could be sitting on a train back to Paris right now!
I can't take it anymore!
Hey, Saiid!
I think that's Roncevaux!
- Guy!
Is that Roncevaux?
- Yes!
- Yes, that's ii!
- We've arrived!
It's Roncevaux!
Yeah!
- It's beautiful.
- Another 500 miles to go, remember.
Come on, let's go.
- How much further?
- 500 miles, he said...
That's a lot.
Mark your motivations on the form.
He only has six beds.
He can't take Saiid, Ramzi and me.
- Why us and not you?
- You need the pilgrim look here.
They don't like darkies.
Listen here, Mr Priest, we've walked 500 miles and we form a group now.
Get it?
Like brothers and sisters.
You don't part brothers and sisters because they work as a team.
- What's wrong with you?
- Belt up!
You first.
You can't part us from our darker brothers.
It's them with us, or no one at all!
- What was that?
- He's making fun of you.
You piece of shit priest!
We're sick of moralizing preachers who act like pigs!
Franco's dead!
There's no fascism in Spain now.
- What did he say?
- My brother isn't always rational.
He can be a poco irrational.
And don't tell me to belt up.
Let's go, I'll pay for a hotel.
I know a nice place, kind of weird, but trendy and wild.
It's another hour's walk.
Is that okay?
Two days without a word.
Are you sulking?
- Yes.
- You are?
When you almost left the other day,
I felt like I'd been knifed.
My love for you surprised me.
I felt worse when I saw how happy you were to go.
You didn't show any sorrow at leaving me.
I came back, didn't I?
Not for me.
I understood it all that day.
- What?
- I've always gone after guys like you.
I've always been sick.
Now I'm cured.
- Didn't you like our nights together?
- I adored them.
There's more to life than sex.
You want to die, I don't.
No news of my mum?
Camille's mum says there's no reply.
- Maybe she's sick.
- Why would she be?
- She goes to the hospital sometimes.
- She's okay.
Ramzi, I have to tell you something.
- I've been fooling you.
- We're not going to Mecca.
No, but you've learned to read.
- We're going to Santiago?
- Yes, it's their Mecca.
Clara says St .James was a bastard.
He was the matamore .
Know what that means?
The guy who kills Moors.
And Moors are Arabs.
He killed a load of Arabs like us.
I didn't know.
Think Camille knows about St James?
No idea.
- Think she loves you?
- Yeah, she loves me.
- Think she likes Arabs?
- Of course.
Why go to see the Moor killer, then?
- I don't know.
- What'll we tell my mum?
That you can read.
All this wasted countryside is terrible.
It's bald land, sick.
Industrialists manage ii.
They visit twice a year, the villages are deserted...
- How are things at home?
- Bad for me, good for them.
Fred has moved in.
The kids love him, my wife too.
His advantage is he's around.
That's a big advantage.
- How are you holding up?
- I'm fine.
- I mean,you've had it tough lately.
- Not at all.
I'm fine.
I saw you without your scarf.
You're beautiful bald too.
Only 13 more stops.
Who saw him last?
I won't get him where he is.
Me neither.
We've behaved lately but if I go...
Okay, I'll go...
Hi.
Here he is!
Our favourite guide!
Okay?
I'm okay.
You're here for me?
Yes.
We wondered where you were.
At the bar...
Always at the bar, me.
Bar, fucking, fucking, bar...
That's living!
I guess so...
You'll be happy with her.
She's great in bed.
Well, bed...
It was in the fields.
Uh-huh.
In the fields.
She'll be happy with you.
We'll see.
It's like the stones we have to throw at Mina.
See... it's all pretty much the same.
Hear that?
That's the maniac at Manjarin calling to pilgrims.
Guaranteed food poisoning there.
I'm going, I'm thirsty.
- No, you're not going.
- Why not?
Because it's not good for you.
- So?
- So you're not going!
What's got into you?
This is it, Monte de Gozo, the Mountain of Joy.
Pilgrims would cry for joy on seeing Santiago at last.
They'd shout, ultreiia and suseiia , "ever higher, ever further".
This was built for the Pope's visit.
Magnificent!
- That's Santiago?
We've arrived?
- Yes, we've arrived.
Ultreiia, suseiia!
Saiid, we've done it!
We're in Santiago!
We're the greatest!
Call my mum!
Tell her I can read and that we're in Santiago de Mecca!
Elsa, can you lend me your mobile?
The battery's nearly flat...
How'd he get up there?
Are there steps round the back?
Hello.
Hi, Rouiia, it's Saiid.
I'm calling from along way away.
Can I talk to Ramzi's mum?
- The battery's flat, we got cut off.
- Put her on!
The battery's flat.
We'll call later.
- Is something wrong?
- No, I'm okay...
- That's the hostel?
It's ugly.
- Looks like a concentration camp.
Wait!
Aren't they the snoring Dutchman?
I think they are.
I'm not sleeping here!
- There's more than one dorm.
- Too risky!
I'll treat you to the Parader.
I can walk 90 minutes to get away from them.
Get out your credentials.
Thank you, ma'am.
See you later!
- Here?
- This is it!
It's beautiful!
Good night.
Good night.
"At last we spied the city of Santiago.
"We got down on our knees and starteted..."
Started.
"...started to shed tears of joy
"and sing the Te Deum..."
The Te Deum.
That's Latin.
"...the Te Deum, but we couldn't
"utter a single word,
"because of the tears flowing from our eyes."
This is Fisterra_ it's the very end of mainland Europe.
Ramzi's mum is dead.
Saiid hasn't told him yet.
I have the papers.
Your cheques are ready.
Your mother wanted you to come back here one last time, to your childhood home, before it's sold.
"Ramzi with us."
"Ramzi's room is ready."

Come on!
Let me in!
Go!
you know?
You are from another planet and that's the machine that brought you here.
- What?
- You've been staring at that hole for half an hour and you haven't told me a blessed thing.
Do you remember what happened or not?
Yeah...
It blew up.
And here you are in a brand new world.
Yeah.
Earth.
Third planet from the Sun.
Lubinsky.
Tell you something else.
This is no accident.
You can tell that just by looking?
I saw a man and a woman shoot it out with security.
What?
The woman's still alive I saw her in the city.
These guys had no idea what was really going on.
Company headquarters.
Vexcor Cape Town
I did.
But I wasn't telling anyone.
That was rich.
A member of the public ripping off the company for a change?
Does anyone hate the family business?
baby.
Is that so bad?
Subtitles by s3khmet
She was a surprise I didn't count on.
Once I realized she was here it was easy to make it work for me.
no friends...
No record of her anywhere...
She was perfect.
Know where I could find a good detective?
- How much?
- 100 rand a day and a couch to sleep on.
Got any change?
150.
Don't bite the hand that feed you.
I give what I can.
- Where is the couch?
- Somewhere around here.
Just... make yourself at home.
Take off your coat.
First order of business is tracking that woman you saw.
These friends or enemies?
Depends on who you ask...
This guy an alien too?
do you?
See.
You see?
That's Nelson Mandela.
Easily recognizable anywhere in the world.
And you don't know who he is.
Take a look at these.
Photos of suspected and known female terrorists.
Published by Interpol.
You do know what Interpol is?
Refresh my memory.
Are you sick?
it's just a cold.
- I'd like to rent a room.
- How long are you staying?
maybe.
500.
Plus 100 for security deposit.
50 for the key.
17.
Reena.
What do you see?
- Do you see what I see?
- Yes.
This place must never change.
It was home to them.
But we called it Gammaverse.
The big prize.
- Who are they?
- No idea.
Knowing the way things work around here it'll be a while before we find out.
Local law enforcement not much help I guess...
Not like back home.
not minutes.
Vehicle was stolen.
We found some sophisticated diagrams in the back.
they knew what they were doing.
You think they're dead?
He is.
We're pretty sure we found his body.
No sign of her though.
I thought you were on your way back to head office.
Just after breakfast.
Can't get this back home.
A good-looking couple.
There's a copy in the communiqué to Rompkin.
It'll be on her desk before lunch.
Good seeing you.
Catch you later.
What did you say?
I said she got away.
Where would you go if you were her?
I don't know.
Hard to say without knowing who she is.
When I look out there I see Table Mountain.
What do you see?
I see the same thing as you.
Complete destruction of both facilities?
Total incineration.
Just like here.
124 dead in Gamma.
237 in Beta.
- 320 here.
- I don't want to talk numbers.
I want to know what happened.
my guess would be a chain reaction that started in Gamma.
Do you have the slate?
Triggered by an act of sabotage.
Sabotage in Gamma?
Why don't you read Ipstak's report?
one missing.
I spoke to the head of security myself.
But it doesn't make sense.
What about Elliot Krogg?
what?
He was last seen in Beta driving away from the facility just before the explosion.
Good god.
This is our worst nightmare.
This man?
Yeah.
That's him.
Who is he?
Didn't we order him home a month ago?
He's one of our top scientists.
He may also be the architect of this catastrophe.
01.
Be ready to leave again in 3 hours.
Any time.
Ladies.
Passengers traveling on train 18006...
Look happy!
We're going on vacation.
Driving would have been better.
now boarding on platform 24.
Are you thirsty?
I'm fine.
Go get something for yourself I'll wait here.
Elliot Krogg.
He used to be one of us.
But he was like so many of our scientists in Betaverse.
the less they wanted to go home to Cape City.
You now own the famous Glass Door.
it's a great place for this market.
I'll see you in your office tomorrow.
Julius!
has Cape Town real estate gone through the roof!
have a look.
I have the keys...
I'll be on my way.
Come on.
I'll show you my new office.
it'd have felt I could pick the place up cheap.
you know.
Julius.
what's the latest on Elliot Krogg?
- It'll be in my next report.
- Is he still missing?
Where is the slate?
I asked you a question.
The police picked up his girlfriend.
Things are looking up.
Julius.
Somebody posted this on my website.
The whole event captured by a security camera.
Who's the guy in the car?
He works for Vex-Cor.
Some sort of scientist.
Had a colleague track his license plate.
His name is Elliot Krogg.
Was it blind luck that he was driving away at the right moment?
No.
Saw him banging on the gate trying to get in.
drove away.
That's it?
- Yeah.
That's it.
- You sure?
Nothing more?
you saw the girl running around the city...
- You think I'm making this up?
- No I think you're not playing straight with me.
or what your angle is...
All I'm trying to do is figure out what's going on.
- I'm trying to help you f...
- You're not trying to help me.
You're trying to use me to prove some insane theory...
Headache?
I've got some painkillers.
take this.
Take this... take this... take this...
What's going on?
What happened?
This Krogg guy?
He helped build the facility.
So he knew what Vex-Cor was up to.
And it scared him to death.
I had to find this guy.
No... don't you see?
Don't you understand what's going to happen?
No... don't you see?
!
And it was my job...
to find this winner.
Lubinsky.
Elliot Krogg is on the run.
He's not hiding out in his house.
Whoever's looking for him is gonna be watching us now.
I got nothing to hide.
looking for answers.
- Answers that'll get you killed.
- What are you talking about?
- Killed by who?
Vex-Cor?
- In a heartbeat.
You think?
There it is.
Around here Vex-Cor may be a powerful multinational but they don't rule the planet.
Not yet anyway.
No one's home.
uh...
I didn't mean what I said about you stringing me along...
Got no reason to trust me.
okay?
What are you doing?
Surveillance camera.
That's impossible.
Vex-Cor's been using this stuff for 20 years.
Thought you said you live here?
You really think I'm an alien?
Let's find out for sure.
Take me to a med-center.
a hospital.
Whatever you call places for sick and dying people.
Get some blood work done.
A complete DNA profile.
Maybe I'm dreaming.
Maybe this is one big hallucination.
What don't you understand?
Signing of this document is merely a formality.
It says you've been made aware of the situation.
You haven't made me aware of anything.
Jasmine...
Charlie Jade is...
legally dead.
... are turned over to the state.
But the state doesn't employ C-3s.
You're out on your own.
You understand.
I don't believe Charlie's dead.
Does this mean you won't sign the form?
This means Charlie still lives here and you're trespassing on his property.
I don't even need your signature... is a witness.
Got any change?
Find a hole.
500 rand to the desk sergeant and look who I got sprung.
Windy.
- Who are you?
- A friend.
Elliot sent me.
I don't believe you.
Karen.
Got you out of custody...
Cleared things up with the police...
- Elliot can't wait to see you.
- Where is he?
He's not far.
Here.
Please.
I found it parked.
Near the Vex-Cor reactor.
No sign of Charlie.
Any idea what he was doing out there?
He didn't tell me anything.
A passer-by saw him walking into the desert.
Just before the explosion.
He could still be out there.
Could be...
I could talk to your...
Previous employer.
He might take you back.
No.
I can't.
- Then what?
wait.
Jasmine!
Got any change?
Open up.
open up!
I need to sleep.
I hear you're sick.
Some say you're dying.
I'm not dying.
Christ!
Look at you!
leave... me... alone!
- Leave you alone?
- Yeah.
I want you out of here.
You got to die elsewhere.
You want more money?
I've got better things to do than to talk to cops and coroners.
you hear me?
Go die in the friggin' gutter.
What is that?
The only thing I have of any value at the moment.
It decodes and downloads data.
- Can I take it?
- Don't touch it.
- Does this port work?
- I don't know.
This technology must be 50 years old.
I bought this last year.
that's what's going on.
Now you're talking my language.
Science speculation.
Anything's possible.
- Son of a bitch!
- You know him?
It's 01 Boxer.
He's the prick I was looking for when the reactor exploded.
Unbelievable.
I'm here and so is he.
Son of Brion Boxer?
You've heard of him?
he founded Vex-Cor in the 70s.
He died of cancer a few years ago.
he didn't.
Just retired from the public eye and no-one knows how sick he is.
Son of a bitch started the largest empire on the planet.
Won't give it up.
Made his mistress the CEO so he doesn't have to.
A woman?
Essa Rompkin.
Her face is everywhere.
Never heard of her.
How long before we reestablish a temporary link?
Three months of economic chaos.
We can't get raw materials.
We can't reach our markets.
Our fate rests on your son's hands.
Essa.
I need to know ...
Karen.
Where he is.
Who he's working with.
I know you're frightened.
I know that you have to protect your boyfriend.
But...
I need to know these things.
I do.
- Where are you?
- Heading into the desert.
I hope it's worth it.
Wait a minute.
Have you got a light?
I'm sorry.
- I don't smoke.
- I don't smoke either.
So... you live around here?
No.
Just uh just passing through.
I hope.
uh sorry about...
Sorry about the other day.
it could have been worse.
You could have wrecked (*?
*) the place.
Yeah...
Some women do that to me.
She must be something special...
Yeah...
Don't be a stranger.
- Weren't you going home?
- I am home.
I have a question for you.
Why was Krogg banging on the gates to get inside?
No idea.
It doesn't make any sense if he's working with the girl you saw.
But what if he was trying to stop her?
I want to talk about one of your other theories.
You know what this is?
Lab report.
Medical proof I'm as human as you are.
Right down to my DNA.
no... here she comes right now...
Recognize her?
She's the one on the slate.
The suspect from Gammaverse.
What the hell are you doing in my office?
Looking at pretty pictures.
- Have you seen this?
- What do you know about the disappearance of Krogg's girlfriend?
I thought she was in police custody.
she vanished last night.
God damn.
How did she get here?
More to the point.
How do you plan to tell this world that there is a terrorist on the loose.
From Gamma...
Karen?
Yes.
You won't forget?
Names...
Dates...
Places...
I won't forget.
Goody.
Elliot's the kindest man I've ever met.
Are you sure I'll find him in that motel?
He's waiting for me there now.
let's not keep him waiting any longer.
Ciao.
That better be coffee and not your cologne.
You look very uncomfortable whatever you are.
That's been clearly established.
The question is: where am I and who the hell are you?
it doesn't make sense.
I'm gonna take a leak.
Lubinsky.
- Check your mail.
- The answer's gotta be simple.
Like what?
I don't know.
I'm hungry.
I don't believe it.
I know where Krogg is.
let's go.
How long can we keep this to ourselves?
Couple of hours at best.
Then we'll have to let the authorities in on it.
The information has to come from us.
It's the only way we can control this.
Sorry to interrupt.
I thought you should know.
A federal agent has just arrested Krogg's girlfriend at the docks.
What?
Why would Krogg contact you?
maybe he thinks I can help him.
What is it?
Vex-Cor agents.
They are?
Drive away slowly.
I said: open up!
I told her to clear up.
Haven't seen her since last night.
- What did she do?
- We'll take it from here.
She's here!
Over there.
No!
Mr Boxer!
This won't take long Elliot.
I don't know anything.
I think you do.
they can't blame this on me!
Tell me everything.
right?
- What?
What do I need a weapon for?
Jesus...
Another headache?
I ought to take you to the doctor.
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Back it up!
What do you see?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Let's go.
Sabotage.
No...
It had nothing to do with that.
No!
Don't you see?
!
Do you understand what will happen if they link Alpha to Beta?
I do now.
your secret is safe with me.
- Which room number?
- 304.
He said he'd be here.
are you in there?
I'll go get the manager.
Krogg?
I don't get it.
What could drive him mad to take his own life that way?
He didn't kill himself.
- Boxer murdered him.
- Why?
I don't know why.
But that's what he came here to do.
Came here from where?
Came here from where?
!
Some place just like this.
Only better.
And much worse...
What?
You're from a parallel universe.
don't you see?
only different.
whatever.
You're out of your damn mind.
there are theories backed up by scientific evidence.
More coffee?
Anything to silence my friend.
Until today we had considered this explosion to be a terrible accident.
But now we have new evidence that it was a deliberate act.
An act of terror.
What a surprise...
Federal and international law inforcement agencies have authorized us to release this picture of the person we believe to be responsible.
This is the new face of terror.
isn't it?
That's the woman you saw.

Yeah.
Draw up the papers, I'll see you in your office tomorrow.
Julius!
Man, has Cape Town real estate gone through the roof!
Come inside, have a look.
I have the keys...
No, thanks.
Give me the slate, I'll be on my way.
Come on.
I'll show you my new office.
After Rick's accident, it'd have felt I could pick the place up cheap.
Our influence only goes so far, you know.
I know my way around, Julius.
Now, what's the latest on Elliot Krogg?
- It'll be in my next report.
- Is he still missing?
Where is the slate?
I asked you a question.
The police picked up his girlfriend.
Things are looking up.
Here you go, Julius.
Somebody posted this on my website.
The whole event captured by a security camera.
Who's the guy in the car?
He works for Vex-Cor.
Some sort of scientist.
Had a colleague track his license plate.
His name is Elliot Krogg.
Was it blind luck that he was driving away at the right moment?
No.
Saw him banging on the gate trying to get in.
- You what?
- And he gave up, drove away.
That's it?
- Yeah.
That's it.
- You sure?
Nothing more?
I mean, you saw the scientist, you saw the gun battle, you saw the girl running around the city...
- You think I'm making this up?
- No I think you're not playing straight with me.
I don't know why, or what your angle is...
All I'm trying to do is figure out what's going on.
- I'm trying to help you f...
- You're not trying to help me.
You're trying to use me to prove some insane theory...
Headache?
I've got some painkillers.
Here, take this.
Take this... take this... take this...
What's going on?
What happened?
This Krogg guy?
He helped build the facility.
So he knew what Vex-Cor was up to.
And it scared him to death.
I had to find this guy.
No... don't you see?
Don't you understand what's going to happen?
No... don't you see?
!
And it was my job...
to find this winner.
This is not smart, Lubinsky.
Elliot Krogg is on the run.
He's not hiding out in his house.
Whoever's looking for him is gonna be watching us now.
I got nothing to hide.
I'm just a concerned citizen, looking for answers.
- Answers that'll get you killed.
- What are you talking about?
- Killed by who?
Vex-Cor?
- In a heartbeat.
You think?
There it is.
Around here Vex-Cor may be a powerful multinational but they don't rule the planet.
Not yet anyway.
No one's home.
Listen, uh...
I didn't mean what I said about you stringing me along...
Got no reason to trust me.
Yeah, so let's just leave it at that, okay?
What are you doing?
Surveillance camera.
That's impossible.
Vex-Cor's been using this stuff for 20 years.
Thought you said you live here?
You really think I'm an alien?
Let's find out for sure.
Take me to a med-center.
- A what?
- A medical center, a hospital.
Whatever you call places for sick and dying people.
Get some blood work done.
A complete DNA profile.
Maybe I'm dreaming.
Maybe this is one big hallucination.
What don't you understand?
Signing of this document is merely a formality.
It says you've been made aware of the situation.
You haven't made me aware of anything.
Jasmine...
Charlie Jade is...
legally dead.
And, as he has no legal heirs, all of his assets, which includes you, are turned over to the state.
But the state doesn't employ C-3s.
You're out on your own.
You understand.
I don't believe Charlie's dead.
Does this mean you won't sign the form?
This means Charlie still lives here and you're trespassing on his property.
I don't even need your signature...
All I need, is a witness.
Got any change?
Find a hole.
500 rand to the desk sergeant and look who I got sprung.
Windy.
- Who are you?
- A friend.
Elliot sent me.
I don't believe you.
I'm here to take care of you, Karen.
Got you out of custody...
Cleared things up with the police...
- Elliot can't wait to see you.
- Where is he?
He's not far.
Here.
Please.
I found it parked.
Near the Vex-Cor reactor.
No sign of Charlie.
Any idea what he was doing out there?
He didn't tell me anything.
A passer-by saw him walking into the desert.
Just before the explosion.
He could still be out there.
Could be...
I could talk to your...
Previous employer.
He might take you back.
No.
- No, I can't.
- Then what?
Jasmine...
Jasmine, wait.
Jasmine!
Got any change?
Open up.
- What do you want?
- I said, open up!
I need to sleep.
I hear you're sick.
Some say you're dying.
I'm not dying.
Christ!
Look at you!
Just, leave... me... alone!
- Leave you alone?
- Yeah.
I want you out of here.
You got to die elsewhere.
You want more money?
I've got better things to do than to talk to cops and coroners.
You get the hell out of here, you hear me?
Go die in the friggin' gutter.
What is that?
The only thing I have of any value at the moment.
It decodes and downloads data.
- Can I take it?
- Don't touch it.
- Does this port work?
- I don't know.
This technology must be 50 years old.
Hey, I bought this last year.
Thrown back in time, that's what's going on.
Now you're talking my language.
Science speculation.
Anything's possible.
- Son of a bitch!
- You know him?
It's 01 Boxer.
He's the prick I was looking for when the reactor exploded.
Unbelievable.
I'm here and so is he.
Son of Brion Boxer?
You've heard of him?
Yeah, he founded Vex-Cor in the 70s.
He died of cancer a few years ago.
No, he didn't.
Just retired from the public eye and no-one knows how sick he is.
Son of a bitch started the largest empire on the planet.
Won't give it up.
Made his mistress the CEO so he doesn't have to.
A woman?
Essa Rompkin.
Her face is everywhere.
Never heard of her.
How long before we reestablish a temporary link?
Three months of economic chaos.
We can't get raw materials.
We can't reach our markets.
Our fate rests on your son's hands.
He's only a courier, Essa.
I need to know where Elliot is, Karen.
Where he is.
Who he's working with.
I know you're frightened.
I know that you have to protect your boyfriend.
But...
I need to know these things.
I do.
- Where are you?
- Heading into the desert.
Whatever you're chasing, I hope it's worth it.
Wait a minute.
Have you got a light?
I'm sorry.
- I don't smoke.
- I don't smoke either.
So... you live around here?
No.
Just uh just passing through.
I hope.
Look, uh sorry about...
Sorry about the other day.
No, it could have been worse.
You could have wrecked (*?
*) the place.
Yeah...
Some women do that to me.
She must be something special...
Yeah...
Don't be a stranger.
- Weren't you going home?
- I am home.
I have a question for you.
Why was Krogg banging on the gates to get inside?
No idea.
It doesn't make any sense if he's working with the girl you saw.
But what if he was trying to stop her?
I want to talk about one of your other theories.
You know what this is?
Lab report.
Medical proof I'm as human as you are.
Right down to my DNA.
Humph, no...
Ok, here she comes right now...
Recognize her?
She's the one on the slate.
The suspect from Gammaverse.
What the hell are you doing in my office?
Looking at pretty pictures.
- Have you seen this?
- What do you know about the disappearance of Krogg's girlfriend?
I thought she was in police custody.
Well, she vanished last night.
God damn.
How did she get here?
More to the point.
How do you plan to tell this world that there is a terrorist on the loose.
From Gamma...
Do you remember all the things we talked about, Karen?
Yes.
You won't forget?
Names...
Dates...
Places...
I won't forget.
Goody.
Elliot's the kindest man I've ever met.
Are you sure I'll find him in that motel?
He's waiting for me there now.
Well, let's not keep him waiting any longer.
Ciao.
That better be coffee and not your cologne.
You look very uncomfortable whatever you are.
That's been clearly established.
The question is: where am I and who the hell are you?
You can't be human, it doesn't make sense.
I'm gonna take a leak.
You're looking for something weird and fantastic, Lubinsky.
- Check your mail.
- The answer's gotta be simple.
Like what?
I don't know.
I'm hungry.
I don't believe it.
I know where Krogg is.
Come on, let's go.
How long can we keep this to ourselves?
Couple of hours at best.
Then we'll have to let the authorities in on it.
The information has to come from us.
It's the only way we can control this.
Sorry to interrupt.
I thought you should know.
A federal agent has just arrested Krogg's girlfriend at the docks.
What?
Why would Krogg contact you?
Well, unlike you, maybe he thinks I can help him.
What is it?
Vex-Cor agents.
They are?
Drive away slowly.
I said: open up!
I told her to clear up.
Haven't seen her since last night.
- What did she do?
- We'll take it from here.
She's here!
Over there.
No!
Mr Boxer!
This won't take long Elliot.
No, please, I don't know anything.
I think you do.
Please, they can't blame this on me!
Tell me everything.
- You got a weapon, right?
- What?
What do I need a weapon for?
Jesus...
Another headache?
I ought to take you to the doctor.
Stop the car!
Stop the car!
Back it up!
What do you see?
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Let's go.
Sabotage.
No...
It had nothing to do with that.
No!
Don't you see?
!
Do you understand what will happen if they link Alpha to Beta?
I do now.
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.
- Which room number?
- 304.
He said he'd be here.
Krogg, are you in there?
I'll go get the manager.
Krogg?
I don't get it.
What could drive him mad to take his own life that way?
He didn't kill himself.
- Boxer murdered him.
- Why?
I don't know why.
But that's what he came here to do.
Came here from where?
Came here from where?
!
Some place just like this.
Only better.
And much worse...
What?
You're from a parallel universe.
- What?
- No, don't you see?
Somewhere just like this, only different.
Bigger, faster...
more advanced, whatever.
You're out of your damn mind.
No, no, there are theories backed up by scientific evidence.
More coffee?
Anything to silence my friend.
Until today we had considered this explosion to be a terrible accident.
But now we have new evidence that it was a deliberate act.
An act of terror.
What a surprise...
Federal and international law inforcement agencies have authorized us to release this picture of the person we believe to be responsible.
This is the new face of terror.
That's her, isn't it?
That's the woman you saw.
Uncle...
Uncle
Let's exit from here
Let me eat something
You are sinner
You going to separate with your father?

This ..this is for my instructor
Where her essay came to be here
Get out
I am not telling you
You get out

How come you know this?
This is not what you calling me for?
From the call of college to my house
I didn't call you to here
Anyway, you must get out faster
Wear your panjamas
When does it started?
What are you meant by?
It is the same what i asked this time
When does this relationship begin?
It is not what you think of the relationship
This is not right?
Did you take off your shirt in front of me?
There are... you might not believe this
But it is because of the shirt got wet so I just take it off and leave it in restroom
Beside those, you didn't let other thing happen?
Such a playboy
Are you being sexual harassement?
This is his favorite habit
He forced to bring girl here
Things happen in hotel is not just including you
I thought he will listen this time period
Who knows he had did it again
What do you want?
if there is no purpose you wouldn't follow here right?
I just want to accept response for my essay..so
I will stay in college want to continue study
after continue study want to be a learner?
if it is possible if it is like this you have the price of using him but I think this is unacceptable for you
I think even you encounter difficulty you would not be able to stand up immediately make others think of you as a fraile
except staying in college still there aren't possibility?
please think of it carefully use your effort to create your own world it is a possible thing
Good afternoon How are you
Watch carefully
How can it happen this
What's going on here
Who takes the picture of you?
might be a friend or a lover
You trying to threathen me?
No..
I don't know anything
This is impossible if it is really trys to threat me and sent this pictures here
This is meaningless did I force you to come to hotel?
No
What about the car?
Did I force you to get into the car?
No
What is your purpose of going to hotel?
for the essay instruction
Right?
So
This is for nothing
Let me ask you openly if after you see the picture
What if someone misunderstand us
What will it be?
just say it out loud
beautiful women is a kind of weapon for men
When is crossing over the word men will survive
maybe it is a magic language
is sex
You can call out louder
It is because of sexual harassment?
yes did I sexually harass you?
if you think that way
Lets other professor do this essay
I am saying if you have finished it about the checking of essay
This is final judgement my advice have greatly affect you
I think you should stay in college this would be great
You are lonely and a stubborn person so except knowledge you are not even civilized like a countryside girl after your graduation of college
What are you really wanted to do ?
In this kind of society a girl... women's working rate being considered as most horrible thing, isn't it?
I am saying maybe maybe you found your job
In this great competition society how can you survive?
I am asking your opinion
What do you want to do?
just say it
I...
I think after today of having his lesson
No matter what, i will listen to professor hi~How do you do
You said {no matter what} would it be to excessive?
I never think of letting you do things that you are unwilling to if want to ask about essay
First,we need to learn to trust each other otherwise, it would be too hard this is what I think of
Yes...as professor said please continue to urge me
I know
I know what you mean
I am ok now
although I dont know who did this but you and me have a kind of trusty relationship there's no need to worry about it this might be a jealousy
Right?

Zhenliz
You were part of me in every way whether we were talking, looking, laughing, kissing or sleeping.
I know the way you move.
Your hands, your skin your neck, your smell.
You surround me, although you're not here.
And sometimes I see you, but I can't hear you.
And sometimes I hear you, but I can't see you.
3 DEGREES COLDER
Hello?
Jan!
Nothing.
Let's go home.
Are you sure?
That time you disappeared, I thought I would go crazy.
I waited for your call, for an answer that would explain everything.
It never came.
You had gone, and there was nothing left to explain it.
5 YEARS LATER
Marie!
And magnolias?
They bloom early, but not before March or April.
If you're not bothered about flowers, it's a good time now for beautyberries.
I don't know, somehow I'm missing something.
And I had to spend a whole weekend without you because of this thing?
I hope we're not the last to arrive.
- We might be the only people there.
Jenny?
- Just go right down to the end.
Surround me with luxury and I can do without necessities...
Oscar Wilde was so right!
Nothing to do with me!
Steini, where on earth did you get this?
I was given it.
A present from my aunt.
You're embarrassed, aren't you?
- Why should I be?
Give it to me, I'll put it back.
Has anyone seen my cigarettes?
- On the balcony!
It's nice they're finally moving in together.
Jenny said you're leaving town?
- Yes.
I've been accepted to a master class.
I can't find them.
- Hang on, I'm coming.
Didn't I once give this compass to Jan?
- You want to keep it?
I found it in his room.
You really can't bear to part with anything.
Which box is the cutlery in?
Are we too late?
- Of course you are.
Take these two in.
7th floor.
There's beer in the kitchen.
I hate moving.
At least it's brought us together again.
Olli?
Can you give me a hand?
Hello.
- Hello.
Your mother dropped by the nursery this morning.
She's doing fine at the moment.
And your father?
- Working.
He travels a lot.
Where is the little rascal?
With my parents.
They're visiting.
- Are you alright?
That has to be repaired.
- I know.
Here you are.
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
Sorry I didn't recognize you.
- That's okay.
Pizza's ready!
- Grab it while it's hot!
What did I tell you?
I knew it, we'll never get done here.
Just another half an hour and then we'll take off.
You don't have to eat the crust.
Won't it be a bit cold in the studio?
I think it's romantic.
But you could fix the water heater.
Then I'd raise the rent.
Have one, too.
- Leave her alone.
I'll take it, then.
I'm Babette, by the way.
I'd like things to stay like this forever.
Do you think Jenny and Steini are happy together?
Why not?
What are you thinking about?
Everything.
I love you.
Strange that I always forget that Frank and Marie are married.
It drives me crazy that you behave as though nothing happened with that woman yesterday.
I'm not interested in play-acting.
I love you.
I don't have to play-act that.
Leave me alone.
I'll go and get Jonas, okay?
I haven't been there for a long time.
Frank?
Have you seen my ring?
Frank?
Just a minute.
Where are you?
Didn't you want to go today?
Is it really Sunday already?
Does it still hurt?
He probably just felt penned in.
I played with him.
He caught me with his nose.
I always thought dolphins were gentle creatures.
They are.
It's just the males that sometimes aren't.
You're pretty special, you know that?
She lived opposite.
How do you know?
- I saw them.
Together?
What a nerve.
Kick him out.
Ifl kicked Steini out every time he was unfaithful,
I might as well leave the door open.
What do you think is more important?
To love or be loved?
Mum?
Elisabeth?
Have you only just arrived?
What happened?
- I thought you were already here.
That pack was full on Friday.
I couldn't sleep.
I'll run you a bath.
Why don't you bring your girlfriend over sometime?
I think the cat got out as I came in.
You'll scare Mum to death.
Oscar got out.
I'd almost forgotten how good-looking you are.
How are you?
- Good, thank you.
Dad's got a court case.
He won't be back before the end of the week.
Steini brought them over, back then.
- It's nice you kept them.
Your other things are in the basement.
- Jan?
I'm off.
Could you get me something from the chemist?
Hello.
Just a moment, please.
Bloody cold, isn't it?
- What?
Bloody cold.
- Yes.
I'm sure I had it when we helped them move.
Maybe it fell into one of the boxes.
Don't worry, we'll find it.
- Of course I'm worrying about it.
It's only a ring.
Is everything alright?
- I'm just tired.
My father's drinking again.
You have reached the nursery...
How are you guys doing?
Good, why?
Marie seems so closed off.
Not at all like she used to be.
Well, unlike you, she takes life rather seriously.
Yeah, but you don't have to get all upset about it.
Speak to her about it if you're concerned.
I'm sure she'd be pleased.
Actually, I thought it'd be you who was concerned.
How about you guys?
It's still like we've just fallen in love.
And having Jonas didn't change anything for you two?
Not for me.
Have you got a girlfriend?
- One?
I've got thousands!
Jan!
Your mother is just interested.
I'm on my own.
And, are you happy?
Yes.
Have you got a job?
Do you need money?
I don't need money.
Why are you here?
I don't know.
At least give me a chance to prepare your father.
I always used to wish we lived here.
Do you think people are happier here?
That's amazing.
I was just thinking about you.
Hello, Mrs Engel.
- Hello.
How are you?
- Good, thank you.
You staying a while?
- I don't know yet.
I've got to get going, unfortunately.
How's Frank?
Hasn't changed a bit.
See you at the club?
Three days later they found his car, at a motorway stop in Switzerland.
My father drove down there straight away.
My mother sat in his room every night.
On his bed.
She was convinced he was dead.
Five days later he called us from France.
And he didn't give a reason?
He just disappeared into thin air.
By the way, my mother asked about you.
Maybe you'd like to drop by sometime.
I would like that.
Time to start!
Why don't you come, too?
Please.
Taxi!
Stop!
Criminal Investigation Department.
What's the problem?
-Your ID, please.
Why do you want my ID?
-You've just stolen six newspapers!
What are you talking about?
-You can't just walk away with them.
Here you are.
This gentleman is my witness that you didn't pay for the papers.
Sorry, I probably just forgot to pay.
I'll pay right now.
He stole the papers!
- Very good.
I saw him, I swear I saw him.
-You're a denunciator!
Inspector, do you know who I am?
-A thief.
And now show me your ID.
Can you hold this?
You see the photo?
Do you know who I am?
I'm a journalist.
Then why do you steal newspapers?
-To check what's being written.
Maybe someone else is hungry?
Could you bring some salt?
How else would I know what to write?
Because there's nothing going on in this fucking place, damn it!
He'll be at the club tonight, for sure.
Don't you want to come in for a moment?
Jonas is asleep in the car.
Did you hear?
Jan's back.
Why do you think he's come back?
Maybe because of you.
Because of me?
Do you want to see him?
What sort of question is that?
Why should I?
I don't want to see him ever again.
I just want you to know that it would be okay with me.
Can't you see that your leniency hurts me?
I thought I heard the cat.
Leave the hall light on for Olli, he always comes in late.
Your father's gotten a bit messy, huh?
He died three years ago.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.
You couldn't know.
I've rented out the studio.
To Olli's girlfriend.
Want a coffee?
- Yes, please.
Have you got something to smoke?
It's five years ago.
What did you expect?
That we'd be waiting at the station for you?
We're adults now, right?
Adults!
If you're an adult then I must be mature.
Or faithful.
How brave of him to send you this letter.
He really loves her.
How did your father die?
Brain tumor.
Two days before he died he said,
"Come on, my boy, tomorrow you'll learn how to ride a bicycle."
He only weighed 40 kilos and I could carry him to the toilet by myself.
And your mother?
She went to Hamburg after he died, to live with my sister and her two children.
And why are you still here?
- Because I like it here, really.
Did you know that by the railtrack it's always three degrees colder?
Jan?
I was worried about you.
I'm going for lunch.
You coming?
No, I'm not hungry.
Thanks.
Booth 17.
Kaczmarek.
Why did you send me that letter?
To change something?
And what would that be?
Maybe I just wanted your absence to become meaningless to us?
How long have you been together?
- Four years.
Why didn't you put that in the letter?
I didn't think you'd come back.
You know what?
I think I'd have come back with you back then if you had found me.
If you want to talk to her, she's always at home at midday.
But what makes you think living together was a mistake?
I don't know, but maybe I don't feel enough for him anymore.
Show him that you are a family.
You said yourself you'd kick him out.
That's got nothing to do with it.
Steini is just Steini.
I have to leave.
I'll ring you again later.
When is it going to stop?
With hearing damage the most important thing is to rest.
We've reached the pressure level for therapy.
Why didn't you call me?
You didn't answer.
I'd like to keep you here, Mr Kaczmarek.
Does he have to?
Just overnight, because of the infusion.
- Okay.
The nurse will show you your room.
I'm staying here with you.
I've only booked a table for four at Mario's.
Then we ask for a bigger one.
- Don't put yourselves out on my account.
You smell of freedom and adventure again.
How did the case go?
- I don't know.
The main trial begins tomorrow.
Udo is standing in for me.
You look tired.
I'll go take a quick shower.
Come with me?
- What about the coffee?
Milk and sugar for me, thanks.
Lfit's too cold in the guest room, I can turn up the heat.
I'm sorry.
What?
- I can't stay.
Why not?
I don't know...
I imagined it all differently.
It would have been nice to know that you're coming.
How about breast of duck?
I can recommend the grilled Ocean Perch.
I'm sorry things don't always suit your plans.
Jan, how about breast of duck?
I'll have the fish.
Without salad.
What about you, Olli?
Lasagne.
Have you still got a bottle of that excellent Pouilly Fumˆm?
- Of course.
What a shame your girlfriend couldn't come.
What does she do, exactly?
She's a musician.
- Oh, really?
How nice.
Come on.
I'll be right there.
You go on ahead.
What do you think would've happened if we'd found him that time?
I don't know.
He's probably just the same old Jan.
Do you think we risk enough?
How do you mean?
In general.
In life.
Go to the club.
How are you?
Be glad you didn't come.
I'm sorry.
The pretty chemist!
What a small world.
Ifl'd known the dinner was important to you, I'd have come along.
It meant nothing.
So what's it like, being back here?
Different.
Exactly the same.
I don't think I can do this.
- What?
Let you say goodbye to me so casually.
Is this goodbye?
Let's dance.
Don't you think this is going a bit far?
I can't sleep anyway.
Can you look after the cat tomorrow?
Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Why?
Just wondering.
- How about you?
I'm fine.
Well...
Goodnight, then.
Goodnight.
I'm coming with you.
Was that the woman from next door?
- Yes.
Why don't you give him a hard time about it?
It's not about that.
What then?
- I'm pregnant again.
Bit embarrassing for a chemist, isn't it?
Firstly, I'm not an express train and secondly I've never come home so drunk.
There's beer out on the balcony.
Thanks.
So that's why you're always late.
- I'm always there when it matters.
Hey, there's a child sleeping in this flat!
I haven't forgotten.
What have you been carrying around in that plastic bag all day?
A present.
Be careful, please.
Strange little outfit.
Who does it belong to?
- It's for my daughter.
Why didn't you tell that you've got family?
Didn't expect him to have, huh?
No neighbours?
Certainly not as pretty as the last ones.
Sometimes you're so unbearable.
I just say what I think.
Just thinking it is bad enough.
Hello.
I'm so dizzy.
Shall I get you some water?
I think I'll get going.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be sorry.
I'd forgotten all about this.
To give you a glimpse of a whole dolphin,
Noah will now jump out of the water.
Noah is our male dolphin and was born here ten years ago.
The two fins at the front have a special name:
Flippers.
They are very flexible and steer the dolphin through the water.
I thought you didn't like zoos.
But I like the way you smell.
Are you on your way to work?
- It's my break.
My last one.
We don't have much more time.
Pick me up.
Did he say anything to you?
But you did talk to him, didn't you?
- He danced.
And he didn't ask after me at all?
Ask him yourself.
This morning he was still crashed out on our sofa, drunk.
Have you put on weight?
You know what, Marie?
Don't insult me when something's bugging you.
Say hi to Frank for me.
Money and a long life.
Lots of money.
A child?
- Not that I know of.
But I see a ring here.
I lost it.
I often think about you.
And what do you think about?
For example, how we went to your uncle's 50th birthday.
You were driving, the window was open and your hair was blowing about.
Why did you leave?
I didn't leave.
I just didn't come back.
Strange that she gave up studying.
I thought she was really keen.
Who are you talking about?
- Marie.
Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, please.
I remember how enthusiastic Udo was about her when she worked at our firm.
Have you seen each other?
You were a beautiful couple.
Put a couple more spoonfuls in.
One, two.
Where were you all night?
Around.
And did you have a nice evening?
Meaning?
- Exactly what I said.
How am I supposed to know what you really mean?
You can tell.
- No, I can't.
It always sounds the same.
Are you crying?
Your father rang.
And your mother was here.
They're looking for you.
Come with me.
I can't.
You know what it is that binds us.
Why should I?
Because you know what it is to feel like a stranger in one's own life.
Marie.
I need time.
Where were you all day?
- With Jan. I thumped him one.
Do you want a beer, or are you not drinking today?
How's your ear?
Since when have you been interested in my ears?
Just do whatever you want.
Hey!
You were right.
He's exactly the same.
Oscar?
We should ring the animal shelter.
Can you do me a favour?
Now you have an excuse to wear your new shoes.
Yes.
You know why he came back?
Because I sent him your letter.
Great, so we just don't care about each other anymore.
How can you say something like that?
Can you leave me three cigarettes?
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Sorry about the other day.
A vodka, please!
Are you making one?
Cheers!
Everything okay?
- What?
Everything okay?
- Of course.
Please just watch what you do.
Come on.
Can I introduce you to my daughter?
Unusual place to bring such a young girl.
It's my birthday.
- Really?
Champagne, two bottles!
Happy birthday, princess!
Ask your Dad, he knows how to open these things.
To the winner!
To the winner!
Let them have their fun.
Come on...
You're above such things.
What do you think would've happened if we'd had a child back then?
I don't know.
I haven't ever thought about it.
I often thought at least then something would have remained of our love.
Sad, don't you think?
Are you cold?
A little.
What are you thinking about?
Now I always know where you are.
And I ask myself, who is that behind me?
I stop.
She stops, too.
I turn and she's gone.
And I'm thinking, hey, she's got exactly the same bag.
I was pretty drunk.
But you're not drinking anything.
Frank?
It was nice having you here, Jan.

OLDER TED:
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure it looks great on TV,
But in reality, it's always just a big letdown,
But in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible;
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve,
I had an idea of how to do it, too, and all it cost was half my Christmas bonus,
Yeah, that's right.
A limo.
- ROBIN:
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
- Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last New Year's, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year, we party together, or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions,
- and I narrowed them down to these five.
- Question.
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received, and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
(ALL EX CLAIM)
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City, and that is where we will ring, nay, rock in the new year.
All right, and party number one, that's where we get to meet Marybeth?
- Marybeth?
- Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight, we'll see... (CLEARING THROAT)
People often ask me, "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched
- "so much of the time?"
- By who?
Who asks you that?
(LAUGHING)
And the answer is right here.
My own, personal, get-psyched mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now, prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
(YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME PLA YING ON STEREO)
- It's working.
- I'm definitely getting psyched.
God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Hello!
Hey, Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys, but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
OLDER TED;
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend Derek,
Derek, He was, like, rich, successful, handsome,
I hated that guy,
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
- ROBIN:
Bye.
- Happy New Year.
- Bye.
- Here we go.
- Oh, this kind of sucks.
- Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means were gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit.
Party number one.
- Party number one!
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiancé, Marshall.
Hi.
Marybeth.
It's so great to meet you guys.
- Oh, well, my word.
- Oh, hey.
Well, you're friendly.
(NATALYA LAUGHING)
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT) Hello, American party friends of Barney's.
- Oh, no.
- So, Barney, who's your new friend?
- Natalya.
- Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-off-her-ass-istan?
Super drunk fantastic, huh?
(MUMBLING)
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Oh, okay.
I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment so I can change?
Come on, Lily.
We have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a rock?
(YELLING)
- Ranjit, party number two!
- Party number two!
(ALL CHEERING)
- Party number two, not so good.
- No, let's go back to party number one.
TED:
No, no turning back.
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three!
- Yeah!
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
- Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
- Sorry.
- Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So, while you may choose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up.
- I'm sorry about Barney.
- No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
Just a sec.
(CELLPHONE RINGING)
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
OLDER TED;
Derek, Now we had a tight schedule to keep that night, and I was already on a date with another girl,
But it was Robin,
Ranjit, turn it around.
Hi.
Oh, God, I am so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule, and I screwed it all up.
No.
This is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Oh, Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
(COUGHING)
Okay, now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
- Oh, dude, not now!
- What?
She needs to get psyched!
- Barney!
- Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
Barney!
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin.
You're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through, so what?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Marybeth.
Oh, wow, you're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
- Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya.
- Oh, yes, Ted, you rock.
(STAMMERING) We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,
- but we do have time for hot dogs?
- Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No!
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on, we have an hour-and-a-half before midnight,
- and I don't wanna be kissing Ranjit.
- You don't know what you're missing.
- Come on.
It's only a 20-minute detour.
- Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
- Wait, baby, what are you doing?
- No, I'm going home.
- What?
No!
- No, you can't, Lily!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there,
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But hot dogs.
Oh, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them, and I'll meet you at party number three.
- Are you sure?
- Lf I don't see you, Happy New...
Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
- We'll find each other.
- I know we will.
MARSHALL:
Bye, Lil.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh yeah!
- Look at us, riding around in a limo, eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the President.
- Hey, I bet you're feeling better now.
- Oh, so much better.
Guys, is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
OLDER TED;
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young,
- No way.
- That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
TED:
Moby.
Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God, he's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
- Hey.
- Hello.
What's up?
You going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
(GIGGLING)
- Wow.
You're friendly.
- Big fan.
I'm Barney Stinson.
So, what about this party?
Oh, it's just a New Year's thing with some friends.
Wow.
That sounds awesome.
- You guys wanna come?
- Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Ted.
- Sidebar.
- Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party, and then, afterwards...
No, I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta find her.
- Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
- But...
Come on.
Moby's party.
Moby's party.
Moby's...
- Ranjit, Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
- I think it should be all rise.
- Yes.
Moby.
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
- I never leave home without it.
- That's how I feel about Janice here.
So, then I said, your motorcycle was like that when I got here.
(GIGGLING)
- You're not Moby, are you?
- Who?
- Moby.
The recording artist, Moby.
- No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said, "Tony."
- So, your name is Tony?
- No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys gonna come in?
- No.
- You sure?
Come on, it's gonna get nuts in there.
It's this dude who owes me money.
No, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey.
Be safe.
(EXHALES)
- Why did we think that guy was Moby?
- I don't know.
I see a short, bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
That's Marshall's phone.
Hey...
- (IN DEEP VOICE) Hello.
- Oh, Marshall.
Thank God I got through!
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
- Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God, guess who just walked in?
Moby.
Moby?
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby!
Oh, no, I know Moby, and that's...
Does he have a gun?
Run!
Oh, my God.
Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
(GASPING FRANTICALLY)
Who was that guy?
Well, we know it's not Moby, and it's not Tony.
- Ranjit!
Drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
- Party number three!
Party number three.
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no.
You were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to, what?
That's right.
Re-psych.
Re...
Where's the...
Oh, my God, Not Moby took my get-psyched mix!
Barney, Barney, what the hell!
Barney, it's not worth it.
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
(TIRE BURSTING)
Oh, nuts.
Ranjit, you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire, we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
Guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed?
'Cause everyone's calling their loved ones.
Everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
Oh, sure.
Laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits, and cigars, and bimbos, and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your get-psyched mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We gotta stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
(SINGING YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME)
(RANJIT SINGING)
I'm gonna get some air.
It'll be fine, we'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm gonna head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
What?
No!
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but we...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
- And I can tell that she's into you, too.
- That's ridiculous.
- Wait, really?
- Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Marybeth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo, I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
I'm gonna call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
- Marshall!
Marshall!
- I'm sorry about your girl.
- Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Derek.
Hi, how's work?
Give you some privacy.
LILY:
Marshall!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Marshall!
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45, we celebrate the new year in Central Standard time.
Marshall!
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve, which is the single biggest letdown of a night, every single year.
- Marshall!
- Come on!
Come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got 10 minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Year's, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
- Marshall!
- MARSHALL:
Lily!
- Holy crap.
- Marshall!
(MARSHALL YELLING)
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three, so I walked.
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out, he signed my shirt.
And guess what I found?
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
- I know.
I know.
Come on.
- Come on.
Marshall.
Baby, baby.
I was so worried about you.
Why didn't you call me?
I tried, baby, all the circuits are jammed.
But, wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome!
I wanna cry.
It is so awesome.
- We have to go there.
- How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
- Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to wake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I'll get you there in six.
(HORNS HONKING)
I don't think I can do it.
- No, come on.
- No, come on.
- Move, you stupid taxi!
- Move...
- Three minutes!
Come on!
- Come on!
(CORK POPPING)
Ranjit, put her in park.
(EX CLAIMS)
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome.
But it's not the best party in New York, 'cause this is.
Right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- LILY:
Cheers.
- ROBIN:
Cheers.
- Cheers.
OLDER TED;
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve,
Funny thing is, all night long I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo,
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
Derek?
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Come on in.
Robin.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
- I can't believe you made it.
- I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
ALL:
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
OLDER TED;
You probably wanna feel bad for your old man at this point in the story,
Well, don't, Not every night has a happy ending,
But all of it's important, All of it was leading somewhere,
Because suddenly, it was 2006,
And 2006 was a big one,
Ted.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
He kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Ted:
Kids, the thing about new year's eve is that it sucks.
Sure, it looks great on tv,
But in reality, it's always just a big letdown,
But in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible,
To give my friends a great new year's eve.
I had an idea of how to do it
And all it cost was half my christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right... a limo.
( People laughing )
Robin:
Oh, man, ted, this is great.
Ted:
Okay, people,
Let's talk strategy.
Last new years, we went our separate ways,
And it sucked.
This year we
Party together or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions
And I narrowed them down to these five.
Yes, barney, your submissions were received
And no, we will not be attending any parties
In your pants.
All:
Aww...
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was
An actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit
All five parties before midnight,
And then narrow them down to one,
The most awesome party in new york city,
And that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.
Number one, that's where we get to meet mary beth?
Mm-hmm.
Mary beth?
Oh, she works in my office,
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
Hmm.
( Loud throat clearing)
People often ask me, "barney,
How is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
By who?
Who asks you that?
( General snickering )
And the answer is right here...
My own, personal "get psyched" mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall,
But people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now prepare yourselves
For an audio journey
Into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
( Rock music playing )
It's working.
I am definitely getting psyched.
Marshall:
Oh, god.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
( All laughing)
Let's do this!
Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Hello!
( Cheering )
Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
( laughing )
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Oh.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got
Five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but derek
Should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
Oh, yeah, robin was spending new year's
With her boyfriend, derek.
Derek.
He was like rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
Bye.
See ya next year.
Go get 'em.
Well, this kind of sucks.
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit!
Party number one.
Party number one!
Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party
That had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best,
We'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really
Get a chance to meet.
I'm lily, and this is my fiance, marshall.
So great to meet you guys.
Oh, hey.
My word.
You're, you're friendly.
( Woman laughing)
Whoo!
Hello,
American party friends of barney's.
Oh, no.
Ted:
So, barney,
Who's your new friend?
Natalya.
Oh.
Oh, friendly.
So, where are you from, natalya?
The former soviet republic of drunk-off-her-ass-istan?
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?
Isn't she awesome?
How are your feet doing, baby?
Okay, I love these shoes,
But the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?
Come on, lily, we have a tightly scheduled
Evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, ted, but
These dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a...
Rock?
( Rock music playing )
( whooping )
Ranjit!
Party number two.
Party number two.
( Whooping )
Party number two?
Not so good.
Let's go back to party number one.
No, no turning back.
Ranjit, party number three.
Party number three.
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.
We left natalya.
Barney, none of us really liked her.
What?
!
Sorry.
Oh, very nice, lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So while you
May chose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up?
I'm sorry about barney.
No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
( Phone ringing )
Hey, robin.
Ted, derek stood me up.
Pfft.
Derek.
Now, we had a tight schedule, to keep that night
And I was already on a date with another girl.
But...
It was robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.
No, this is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
Derek's stuck in connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on new year's eve?
( Ranjit clearing throat )
( coughs ) okay.
Now I feel worse.
I was really
Looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
( Music playing )
Oh, dude, not now!
What?
She needs to get psyched.
Barney.
Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
All:
Barney!
My finger slipped.
Look, robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's new year's eve.
Look, so your date fell through.
So what?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine, I'll kiss you at...
A little bit after midnight.
Hi, I'm robin.
Mary beth.
Oh.
Oh.
Wow.
You're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
Ranjit, take us to gray's papaya!
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.
We couldn't go back for natalya, a human being,
But we do have time for hot dogs?
Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No.
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on.
We have an hour and a half before midnight
I don't want to be kissing ranjit.
You don't know what you're missing.
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
Which is exactly how much time I need.
Ranjit, stop the car.
Stopping the car.
Oh.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Wait.
Baby,
What are you doing?
I'm going home.
What?
No!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there.
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But...
Hot dogs.
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go,
But it's two against one.
Okay, I'll go with you.
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...
Party number three.
Are you sure?
If I don't see you, happy new year.
Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
We'll find each other.
I know we will.
By, lil.
Bye.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
Ranjit, party number three.
Party number three.
Oh, yeah!
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.
Eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the president.
Hey.
I'll bet
You're feeling better now.
Oh, so much better.
Guys.
Is that moby?
I think that that's moby.
Now, kids, moby was a popular
Recording artist when I was young.
No way.
That's totally moby.
That's awesome.
Ted:
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
Moby!
Hey, moby!
Oh, my god.
He's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
Hey.
Hello.
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
Right.
Wow.
You're friendly.
Big fan.
Barney stinson.
So, uh...
What about this party?
It's just a new year's thing.
You know, with some friends.
Wow, that sounds awesome.
You guys want to come?
Yeah, we'd love to.
All right.
Uh, ted.
Sidebar?
Um...
Moby, switch up, will you?
Moby.
Yeah, what's up?
What about lily?
Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
All the circuits are jammed.
That's new year's eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by moby's party
And then afterwards...
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta...
I gotta find her.
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
But...
Come on!
Moby's party!
Moby's party!
Moby's par... ( clearing throat)
Ranjit.
Moby's party.
Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
I think it should be all rise.
Yes.
Moby...
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
I never leave home without it.
Oh, that's how I feel about janice here.
Jan...
Aah!
So then I said, "uh, your motorcycle was like that
When I got here."
( giggling )
Um,
You're not moby, are you?
Who?
Moby... the recording artist, moby.
No.
But when we said, "hey, moby,"
You said, "yeah."
I thought you said "tony."
So your name is tony?
( Irritated):
No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys going to come in?
Nah.
You sure?
Come on.
It's going to get nuts in there.
There's this dude who owes me money.
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.
Happy new year, not moby.
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.
( Relieved sigh)
Why did we think that guy was moby?
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to moby.
( Musical ring tone plays )
That's marshall's phone.
Oh, marshall, thank god I got through.
Hey, sexy.
Barney, where's marshall?
( Chuckles):
He left his phone in the limo.
He's out looking for you.
What?
Where?
Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my god!
Guess who just walked in... moby!
Moby?
!
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not moby.
Uh, no, I know moby and that's mo...
Does he have a gun?
Run!
Oh, my god, not moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
( Gasping )
Who was that guy?
!
Well, we know it's not moby and it's not tony.
Ranjit, drive!
Where to?
All:
Party number three!
Party number three.
( Tires squeal)
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience,
You know what it's time for?
It's time to...
What?
That's right, re-psych.
Re-psy...
Where's the...?
Oh, my god!
Not moby took my "get psyched" mix!
Barney, barney, barney, it's not worth it!
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
( Loud bang )
Ah, nuts.
( Tire flapping )
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire
And we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish marshall would call.
I guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed
Because everyone's calling their loved ones,
Everyone around the world.
Everyone except barney.
( All snickering )
Oh, sure, laugh.
Laugh for barney stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel
Of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your "get psyched" mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We got to stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome
New year's.
♪ Shot through the heart
♪ and you're to blame, darling
♪ you give love a bad name
Ranjit:
♪a bad name !
Ha!
♪ I play my part and you played your game ♪
♪ Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!
♪
It'll be fine.
We'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm going to head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
No.
Look, I know this night isn't turning out
The way I planned, but...
How long have you been in love with robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
And I can tell that she's into you, too.
That's ridiculous.
Wait.
Really?
( laughs)
Happy new year, ted.
I can't believe mary beth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance
At this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
I'm going to call marshall.
But he left his phone.
Marshall!
Marshall!
I'm sorry about your girl.
Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?

Derek.
Hi.
How's work?
I'll give you some privacy.
Marshall!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Marshall!
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now,
We get to party number three by 12:45.
We celebrate the new year in central standard time.
Marshall!
Give it a rest, ted.
Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more
Than what it is, which is new year's eve
Which is the single biggest letdown of a night
Every single year.
Marshall!
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got ten minutes.
Stop trying to chase down
Some magical, perfect new years, ted.
It doesn't exist.
Marshall!
Marshall:
Lily!
Holy crap.
Marshall!
Lily!
I don't believe it.
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find lily at party number three
So I walked...
I walked to the next party on the list.
Not moby's party?
Yes, moby's party.
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.
And guess what I found.
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
Marshall...
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.
Why didn't you call me?
I tried, baby.
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.
After party number four,
I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.
How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Oh!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep
In the front seat the whole time.
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to wake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away
And all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I get you there in six.
( All cheer )
( horns beeping )
I don't think I can do it.
No!
Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!
Three minutes!
Come on!
( Cork pops)
Ranjit, put her in park.
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome,
But it's not the best party in new york.
'Cause this is, right here.
Cheers.
Well said.
Cheers.
Cheers.
And just like that, we were
Having the perfect new year's eve.
The funny thing is
All night long, I'd been trying to chase something down
That was right there in that limo.
( knocking)
Derek?
!
Derek.
Hey.
Hey, uh, come on in.
Robin:
Hi.
Robin.
I cut my meeting short
Because I wanted to see you at midnight.
I can't believe you made it.
I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
All:
Eight, seven, six,
Five, four, three,
Two, one!
You probably want to feel bad for your old man
At this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
Ted!
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Happy new year.
Happy new year.

Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.
I had an idea of how to do it, too.
And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year we party together or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions and I narrowed them down to these five.
Question?
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
Thas an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?
Mary Beth?
Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight...
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
By who ?
Who asks you that?
And the answer is right here-- my own, personal "get psyched" mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
It's working.
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.
Derek.
He was like rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
Bye.
See ya next year.
Go get 'em.
Well, this kind of sucks.
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit!
- Party number one.
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.
Hi.
Mary Beth.
So great to meet you guys.
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.
American party friends of Barney's.
Oh, no.
So, Barney, who's your new friend?
Natalya.
Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a... rock?
- Ranjit!
Party number two.
- Party number two.
- Party number two?
- Not so good.
Let's go back to party number one.
No, no turning back.
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
!
- Sorry.
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up?
I'm sorry about Barney.
No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
Pfft.
Derek.
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl.
But... it was Robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.
No, this is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
Okay.
Now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
Oh, dude, not now!
What?
She needs to get psyched.
Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at...
a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.
You're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?
Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No.
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on.
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.
You don't know what you're missing.
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
Wait.
Baby, what are you doing?
- I'm going home.
- What?
No!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there.
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But... hot dogs.
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...
- party number three.
- Are you sure?
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
We'll find each other.
I know we will.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.
Eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the president.
Hey.
I'll bet you're feeling better now.
Oh, so much better.
Guys.
Is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.
No way.
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
Moby!
Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
- Hey.
- Hello.
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
- Wow.
You're friendly.
- Big fan.
Barney Stinson.
So, uh... what about this party?
It's just a New Year's thing.
You know, with some friends.
Wow, that sounds awesome.
You guys want to come?
Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.
S idebar?
Um...
Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta...
I gotta find her.
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
But...
Come on!
Moby's party!
Moby's party!
Moby's par...
Ranjit.
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
I think it should be all rise.
Yes.
Moby...
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
I never leave home without it.
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.
Jan...
Aah!
So then I say,
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."
You're not Moby, are you?
Who?
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.
No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said "Tony."
So your name is Tony?
No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys going to come in?
Nah.
You're sure?
Come on.
It's going to get nuts in there.
There's this dude who owes me money.
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.
Why did we think that guy was Moby?
I don't know.
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
That's Marshall's phone.
Hello.
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
- He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God!
Guess who just walked in-
- Moby!
Moby?
!
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby.
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
Who was that guy?
!
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.
Ranjit, drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
Party number three!
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.
Re-psy...
Where's the...?
Oh, my God!
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
Ah, nuts.
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
I guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
Oh, sure, laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We got to stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
"Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling"
"You give love a bad name A bad name"
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"
It'll be fine.
We'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm going to head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
No.
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
And I can tell that she's into you, too.
That's ridiculous.
Wait.
Really?
Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
I'm sorry about your girl.
Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
D erek.
- Hi.
How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got ten minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
Holy crap.
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.
And guess what I found.
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.
How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I get you there in six.
I don't think I can do it.
No!
Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!
Three minutes!
Come on!
Ranjit, put her in park.
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York.
'Cause this is, right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo.
Derek?
!
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
I can't believe you made it.
I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Kids, the thing about new year's eve is that it sucks.
Sure, it looks great on tv,
But in reality, it's always just a big letdown,
But in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible,
To give my friends a great new year's eve.
I had an idea of how to do it
And all it cost was half my christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.
Oh, man, ted, this is great.
Okay, people,
Let's talk strategy.
Last new years, we went our separate ways,
And it sucked.
This year we
Party together or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions
And I narrowed them down to these five.
Yes, barney, your submissions were received
And no, we will not be attending any parties
In your pants.
Aww...
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was
An actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit
All five parties before midnight,
And then narrow them down to one,
The most awesome party in new york city,
And that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.
Number one, that's where we get to meet mary beth?
Mm-hmm.
Mary beth?
Oh, she works in my office,
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
Hmm.
People often ask me, "barney,
How is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
By who?
Who asks you that?
And the answer is right here--
My own, personal "get psyched" mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall,
But people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now prepare yourselves
For an audio journey
Into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
It's working.
I am definitely getting psyched.
Oh, god.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
Let's do this!
Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Hello!
Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Oh.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got
Five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but derek
Should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
Oh, yeah, robin was spending new year's
With her boyfriend, derek.
Derek.
He was like rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
Bye.
See ya next year.
Go get 'em.
Well, this kind of sucks.
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit!
Party number one.
Party number one!
Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party
That had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best,
We'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really
Get a chance to meet.
I'm lily, and this is my fiance, marshall.
So great to meet you guys.
Oh, hey.
My word.
You're, you're friendly.
Whoo!
Hello,
American party friends of barney's.
Oh, no.
So, barney,
Who's your new friend?
Natalya.
Oh.
Oh, friendly.
So, where are you from, natalya?
The former soviet republic of drunk-off-her-ass-istan?
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?
Isn't she awesome?
How are your feet doing, baby?
Okay, I love these shoes,
But the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?
Come on, lily, we have a tightly scheduled
Evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, ted, but
These dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a...
Rock?
Ranjit!
Party number two.
Party number two.
Party number two?
Not so good.
Let's go back to party number one.
No, no turning back.
Ranjit, party number three.
Party number three.
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.
We left natalya.
Barney, none of us really liked her.
What?
!
Sorry.
Oh, very nice, lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So while you
May chose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up?
I'm sorry about barney.
No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
Hey, robin.
Ted, derek stood me up.
Pfft.
Derek.
Now, we had a tight schedule, to keep that night
And I was already on a date with another girl.
But...
It was robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.
No, this is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
Derek's stuck in connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on new year's eve?
Okay.
Now I feel worse.
I was really
Looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
Oh, dude, not now!
What?
She needs to get psyched.
Barney.
Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
Barney!
My finger slipped.
Look, robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's new year's eve.
Look, so your date fell through.
So what?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine, I'll kiss you at...
A little bit after midnight.
Hi, I'm robin.
Mary beth.
Oh.
Oh.
Wow.
You're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
Ranjit, take us to gray's papaya!
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.
We couldn't go back for natalya, a human being,
But we do have time for hot dogs?
Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No.
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on.
We have an hour and a half before midnight
I don't want to be kissing ranjit.
You don't know what you're missing.
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
Which is exactly how much time I need.
Ranjit, stop the car.
Stopping the car.
Oh.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Wait.
Baby,
What are you doing?
I'm going home.
What?
No!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there.
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But...
Hot dogs.
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go,
But it's two against one.
Okay, I'll go with you.
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...
Party number three.
Are you sure?
If I don't see you, happy new year.
Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
We'll find each other.
I know we will.
By, lil.
Bye.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
Ranjit, party number three.
Party number three.
Oh, yeah!
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.
Eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the president.
Hey.
I'll bet
You're feeling better now.
Oh, so much better.
Guys.
Is that moby?
I think that that's moby.
Now, kids, moby was a popular
Recording artist when I was young.
No way.
That's totally moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
Moby!
Hey, moby!
Oh, my god.
He's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
Hey.
Hello.
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
Right.
Wow.
You're friendly.
Big fan.
Barney stinson.
So, uh...
What about this party?
It's just a new year's thing.
You know, with some friends.
Wow, that sounds awesome.
You guys want to come?
Yeah, we'd love to.
All right.
Uh, ted.
Sidebar?
Um...
Moby, switch up, will you?
Moby.
Yeah, what's up?
What about lily?
Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
All the circuits are jammed.
That's new year's eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by moby's party
And then afterwards...
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta...
I gotta find her.
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
But...
Come on!
Moby's party!
Moby's party!
Moby's par...
Ranjit.
Moby's party.
Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
I think it should be all rise.
Yes.
Moby...
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
I never leave home without it.
Oh, that's how I feel about janice here.
Jan...
Aah!
So then I said, "uh, your motorcycle was like that
When I got here."
Um,
You're not moby, are you?
Who?
Moby-- the recording artist, moby.
No.
But when we said, "hey, moby,"
You said, "yeah."
I thought you said "tony."
So your name is tony?
No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys going to come in?
Nah.
You sure?
Come on.
It's going to get nuts in there.
There's this dude who owes me money.
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.
Happy new year, not moby.
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.
Why did we think that guy was moby?
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to moby.
That's marshall's phone.
Oh, marshall, thank god I got through.
Hey, sexy.
Barney, where's marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
He's out looking for you.
What?
Where?
Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my god!
Guess who just walked in-- moby!
Moby?
!
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not moby.
Uh, no, I know moby and that's mo...
Does he have a gun?
Run!
Oh, my god, not moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
Who was that guy?
!
Well, we know it's not moby and it's not tony.
Ranjit, drive!
Where to?
Party number three!
Party number three.
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience,
You know what it's time for?
It's time to...
What?
That's right, re-psych.
Re-psy...
Where's the...?
Oh, my god!
Not moby took my "get psyched" mix!
Barney, barney, barney, it's not worth it!
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
Ah, nuts.
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire
And we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish marshall would call.
I guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed
Because everyone's calling their loved ones,
Everyone around the world.
Everyone except barney.
Oh, sure, laugh.
Laugh for barney stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel
Of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your "get psyched" mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We got to stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome
New year's.
♪ shot through the heart
♪ and you're to blame, darling
♪ you give love a bad name
♪a bad name!
Ha!
♪ I play my part and you played your game ♪
♪ darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!
♪
It'll be fine.
We'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm going to head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
No.
Look, I know this night isn't turning out
The way I planned, but...
How long have you been in love with robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
And I can tell that she's into you, too.
That's ridiculous.
Wait.
Really?
Happy new year, ted.
I can't believe mary beth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance
At this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
I'm going to call marshall.
But he left his phone.
Marshall!
Marshall!
I'm sorry about your girl.
Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
Derek.
Hi.
How's work?
I'll give you some privacy.
Marshall!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Marshall!
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now,
We get to party number three by 12:45.
We celebrate the new year in central standard time.
Marshall!
Give it a rest, ted.
Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more
Than what it is, which is new year's eve
Which is the single biggest letdown of a night
Every single year.
Marshall!
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got ten minutes.
Stop trying to chase down
Some magical, perfect new years, ted.
It doesn't exist.
Marshall!
Lily!
Holy crap.
Marshall!
Lily!
I don't believe it.
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find lily at party number three
So I walked-
- I walked to the next party on the list.
Not moby's party?
Yes, moby's party.
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.
And guess what I found.
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
Marshall...
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.
Why didn't you call me?
I tried, baby.
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.
After party number four,
I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.
How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Oh!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep
In the front seat the whole time.
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to wake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away
And all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I get you there in six.
I don't think I can do it.
No!
Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!
Three minutes!
Come on!
Ranjit, put her in park.
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome,
But it's not the best party in new york.
'cause this is, right here.
Cheers.
Well said.
Cheers.
Cheers.
And just like that, we were
Having the perfect new year's eve.
The funny thing is
All night long, I'd been trying to chase something down
That was right there in that limo.
Derek?
!
Derek.
Hey.
Hey, uh, come on in.
Hi.
Robin.
I cut my meeting short
Because I wanted to see you at midnight.
I can't believe you made it.
I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
Eight, seven, six,
Five, four, three,
Two, one!
You probably want to feel bad for your old man
At this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
Ted!
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Happy new year.
Happy new year.

OLDER TED:
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure it looks great on TV.
But in reality, it's always just a big letdown.
But in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible:
To give my friends a great New Year's Eve.
I had an idea of how to do it, too, and all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right.
A limo.
- ROBIN:
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
- Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last New Year's, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year, we party together, or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions,
- and I narrowed them down to these five.
- Question.
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received, and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
(ALL EXCLAIM)
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City, and that is where we will ring, nay, rock in the new year.
All right, and party number one, that's where we get to meet Marybeth?
- Marybeth?
- Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight, we'll see... (CLEARING THROAT)
People often ask me, 'Barney, how is it that you're so psyched...
- 'so much of the time?
'
- By who?
Who asks you that?
(LAUGHING)
And the answer is right here.
My own, personal, get-psyched mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now, prepare yourselves for an audio journey... into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
(YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME PLAYING ON STEREO)...
- It's working.
- I'm definitely getting psyched.
God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Hello!
Hey, Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys, but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
OLDER TED:
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending
New Year's with her boyfriend Derek.
Derek.
He was, like, rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
- ROBIN:
Bye.
- Happy New Year.
- Bye.
- Here we go.
- Oh, this kind of sucks.
- Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means were gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit.
Party number one.
- Party number one!
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiancé, Marshall.
Hi.
Marybeth.
It's so great to meet you guys.
- Oh, well, my word.
- Oh, hey.
Well, you're friendly.
(NATALYA LAUGHING)... (IN RUSSIAN ACCENT) Hello, American party friends of Barney's.
- Oh, no.
- So, Barney, who's your new friend?
- Natalya.
- Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-off-her-ass-istan?
Super drunk fantastic, huh?
(MUMBLING)
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Oh, okay.
I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment so I can change?
Come on, Lily.
We have a tightly scheduled evening... of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a rock?
(YELLING)...
- Ranjit, party number two!
- Party number two!
(ALL CHEERING)...
- Party number two, not so good.
- No, let's go back to party number one.
TED:
No, no turning back.
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three!
- Yeah!
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
- Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
- Sorry.
- Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So, while you may choose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up.
- I'm sorry about Barney.
- No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
Just a sec.
(CELLPHONE RINGING)...
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
OLDER TED:
Derek.
Now we had a tight schedule to keep that night, and I was already on a date with another girl.
But it was Robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Hi.
Oh, God, I am so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule, and I screwed it all up.
No.
This is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Oh, Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
(COUGHING)
Okay, now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
- Oh, dude, not now!
- What?
She needs to get psyched!
- Barney!
- Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
Barney!
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin.
You're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through, so what?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Marybeth.
Oh, wow, you're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
- Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya.
- Oh, yes, Ted, you rock.
(STAMMERING) We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,
- but we do have time for hot dogs?
- Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No!
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on, we have an hour-and-a-half before midnight,
- and I don't wanna be kissing Ranjit.
- You don't know what you're missing.
- Come on.
It's only a 20-minute detour.
- Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
- Wait, baby, what are you doing?
- No, I'm going home.
- What?
No!
- No, you can't, Lily!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there,
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But hot dogs.
Oh, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them, and I'll meet you at party number three.
- Are you sure?
- Lf I don't see you, Happy New...
Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
- We'll find each other.
- I know we will.
MARSHALL:
Bye, Lil.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh yeah!
- Look at us, riding around in a limo, eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the President.
- Hey, I bet you're feeling better now.
- Oh, so much better.
Guys, is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
OLDER TED:
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist... when I was young.
- No way.
- That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
TED:
Moby.
Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God, he's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
- Hey.
- Hello.
What's up?
You going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
(GIGGLING)...
- Wow.
You're friendly.
- Big fan.
I'm Barney Stinson.
So, what about this party?
Oh, it's just a New Year's thing with some friends.
Wow.
That sounds awesome.
- You guys wanna come?
- Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Ted.
- Sidebar.
- Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party, and then, afterwards...
No, I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta find her.
- Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
- But...
Come on.
Moby's party.
Moby's party.
Moby's...
- Ranjit, Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
- I think it should be all rise.
- Yes.
Moby.
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
- I never leave home without it.
- That's how I feel about Janice here.
So, then I said, your motorcycle was like that when I got here.
(GIGGLING)...
- You're not Moby, are you?
- Who?
- Moby.
The recording artist, Moby.
- No.
But when we said, 'Hey, Moby,' you said, 'Yeah.'
I thought you said, 'Tony.'
- So, your name is Tony?
- No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys gonna come in?
- No.
- You sure?
Come on, it's gonna get nuts in there.
It's this dude who owes me money.
No, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey.
Be safe.
(EXHALES)...
- Why did we think that guy was Moby?
- I don't know.
I see a short, bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
That's Marshall's phone.
Hey...
- (IN DEEP VOICE) Hello.
- Oh, Marshall.
Thank God I got through!
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
- Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God, guess who just walked in?
Moby.
Moby?
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby!
Oh, no, I know Moby, and that's...
Does he have a gun?
Run!
Oh, my God.
Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
(GASPING FRANTICALLY)
Who was that guy?
Well, we know it's not Moby, and it's not Tony.
- Ranjit!
Drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
- Party number three!
Party number three.
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no.
You were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to, what?
That's right.
Re-psych.
Re...
Where's the...
Oh, my God, Not Moby took my get-psyched mix!
Barney, Barney, what the hell!
Barney, it's not worth it.
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
(TIRE BURSTING)
Oh, nuts.
Ranjit, you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire, we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
Guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed?
'Cause everyone's calling their loved ones.
Everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
Oh, sure.
Laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown... trapped on his whirling carousel of suits, and cigars, and bimbos, and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your get-psyched mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We gotta stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
(SINGING YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME)...
(RANJIT SINGING)
I'm gonna get some air.
It'll be fine, we'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm gonna head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
What?
No!
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but we...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
- And I can tell that she's into you, too.
- That's ridiculous.
- Wait, really?
- Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Marybeth left before midnight.

- Move...
- Three minutes!
Come on!
- Come on!
(CORK POPPING)
Ranjit, put her in park.
(EXCLAIMS)
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome.
But it's not the best party in New York, 'cause this is.
Right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- LILY:
Cheers.
- ROBIN:
Cheers.
- Cheers.

And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.

Derek?
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Come on in.
Robin.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
- I can't believe you made it.

I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.

Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!

We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?
Mary Beth?
Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight...
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
By who ?
Who asks you that?
And the answer is right here-- my own, personal "get psyched" mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
It's working.
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.
Derek.
He was like rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
Bye.
See ya next year.
Go get 'em.
Well, this kind of sucks.
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit!
- Party number one.
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.
Hi.
Mary Beth.
So great to meet you guys.
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.
American party friends of Barney's.
Oh, no.
So, Barney, who's your new friend?
Natalya.
Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a... rock?
- Ranjit!
Party number two.
- Party number two.
- Party number two?
- Not so good.
Let's go back to party number one.
No, no turning back.
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
!
- Sorry.
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up?
I'm sorry about Barney.
No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
Pfft.
Derek.
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl.
But... it was Robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.
No, this is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
Okay.
Now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
Oh, dude, not now!
What?
She needs to get psyched.
Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at...
a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.
You're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?
Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No.
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on.
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.
You don't know what you're missing.
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
Wait.
Baby, what are you doing?
- I'm going home.
- What?
No!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there.
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But... hot dogs.
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...
- party number three.
- Are you sure?
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
We'll find each other.
I know we will.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.
Eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the president.
Hey.
I'll bet you're feeling better now.
Oh, so much better.
Guys.
Is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.
No way.
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
Moby!
Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
- Hey.
- Hello.
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
- Wow.
You're friendly.
- Big fan.
Barney Stinson.
So, uh... what about this party?
It's just a New Year's thing.
You know, with some friends.
Wow, that sounds awesome.
You guys want to come?
Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.
S idebar?
Um...
Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta...
I gotta find her.
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
But...
Come on!
Moby's party!
Moby's party!
Moby's par...
Ranjit.
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
I think it should be all rise.
Yes.
Moby...
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
I never leave home without it.
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.
Jan...
Aah!
So then I say,
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."
You're not Moby, are you?
Who?
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.
No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said "Tony."
So your name is Tony?
No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys going to come in?
Nah.
You're sure?
Come on.
It's going to get nuts in there.
There's this dude who owes me money.
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.
Why did we think that guy was Moby?
I don't know.
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
That's Marshall's phone.
Hello.
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
- He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God!
Guess who just walked in-
- Moby!
Moby?
!
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby.
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
Who was that guy?
!
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.
Ranjit, drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
Party number three!
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.
Re-psy...
Where's the...?
Oh, my God!
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
Ah, nuts.
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
I guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
Oh, sure, laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We got to stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
"Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling"
"You give love a bad name A bad name"
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"
It'll be fine.
We'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm going to head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
No.
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
And I can tell that she's into you, too.
That's ridiculous.
Wait.
Really?
Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
I'm sorry about your girl.
Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
D erek.
- Hi.
How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got ten minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
Holy crap.
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.
And guess what I found.
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.
How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I get you there in six.
I don't think I can do it.
No!
Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!
Three minutes!
Come on!
Ranjit, put her in park.
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York.
'Cause this is, right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo.
Derek?
!
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
I can't believe you made it.
I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
OLDER TED:
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure it looks great on TV,
But in reality, it's always just a big letdown,
But in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible;
to give my friends a great New Year's Eve,
I had an idea of how to do it, too, and all it cost was half my Christmas bonus,
Yeah, that's right.
A limo.
- ROBIN:
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
- Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last New Year's, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year, we party together, or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions,
- and I narrowed them down to these five.
- Question.
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received, and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
(ALL EX CLAIM)
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City, and that is where we will ring, nay, rock in the new year.
All right, and party number one, that's where we get to meet Marybeth?
- Marybeth?
- Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight, we'll see... (CLEARING THROAT)
People often ask me, "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched
- "so much of the time?"
- By who?
Who asks you that?
(LAUGHING)
And the answer is right here.
My own, personal, get-psyched mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now, prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
(YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME PLA YING ON STEREO)
- It's working.
- I'm definitely getting psyched.
God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Hello!
Hey, Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys, but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
OLDER TED;
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend Derek,
Derek, He was, like, rich, successful, handsome,
I hated that guy,
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
- ROBIN:
Bye.
- Happy New Year.
- Bye.
- Here we go.
- Oh, this kind of sucks.
- Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means were gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit.
Party number one.
- Party number one!
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiancé, Marshall.
Hi.
Marybeth.
It's so great to meet you guys.
- Oh, well, my word.
- Oh, hey.
Well, you're friendly.
(NATALYA LAUGHING)
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT) Hello, American party friends of Barney's.
- Oh, no.
- So, Barney, who's your new friend?
- Natalya.
- Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-off-her-ass-istan?
Super drunk fantastic, huh?
(MUMBLING)
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Oh, okay.
I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment so I can change?
Come on, Lily.
We have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.

What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a rock?
(YELLING)
- Ranjit, party number two!
- Party number two!
(ALL CHEERING)
- Party number two, not so good.
- No, let's go back to party number one.
TED:
No, no turning back.
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three!
- Yeah!
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
- Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
- Sorry.
- Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So, while you may choose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up.
- I'm sorry about Barney.
- No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
Just a sec.
(CELLPHONE RINGING)
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
OLDER TED;
Derek, Now we had a tight schedule to keep that night, and I was already on a date with another girl,
But it was Robin,
Ranjit, turn it around.
Hi.
Oh, God, I am so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule, and I screwed it all up.
No.
This is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Oh, Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
(COUGHING)
Okay, now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
- Oh, dude, not now!
- What?
She needs to get psyched!
- Barney!
- Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
Barney!
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin.
You're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through, so what?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Marybeth.
Oh, wow, you're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
- Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya.
- Oh, yes, Ted, you rock.
(STAMMERING) We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,
- but we do have time for hot dogs?
- Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No!
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on, we have an hour-and-a-half before midnight,
- and I don't wanna be kissing Ranjit.
- You don't know what you're missing.
- Come on.
It's only a 20-minute detour.
- Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
- Wait, baby, what are you doing?
- No, I'm going home.
- What?
No!
- No, you can't, Lily!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there,
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But hot dogs.
Oh, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them, and I'll meet you at party number three.
- Are you sure?
- Lf I don't see you, Happy New...
Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
- We'll find each other.
- I know we will.
MARSHALL:
Bye, Lil.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh yeah!
- Look at us, riding around in a limo, eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the President.
- Hey, I bet you're feeling better now.
- Oh, so much better.
Guys, is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.

Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young,

What's up?
You going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
(GIGGLING)
- Wow.
You're friendly.
- Big fan.
I'm Barney Stinson.
So, what about this party?
Oh, it's just a New Year's thing with some friends.
Wow.
That sounds awesome.
- You guys wanna come?
- Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Ted.
- Sidebar.
- Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party, and then, afterwards...
No, I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta find her.
- Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
- But...
Come on.
Moby's party.
Moby's party.
Moby's...
- Ranjit, Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
- I think it should be all rise.
- Yes.
Moby.
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
- I never leave home without it.
- That's how I feel about Janice here.
So, then I said, your motorcycle was like that when I got here.
(GIGGLING)
- You're not Moby, are you?
- Who?
- Moby.
The recording artist, Moby.
- No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said, "Tony."
- So, your name is Tony?
- No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys gonna come in?
- No.
- You sure?
Come on, it's gonna get nuts in there.
It's this dude who owes me money.
No, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey.
Be safe.
(EXHALES)
- Why did we think that guy was Moby?
- I don't know.
I see a short, bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
That's Marshall's phone.
Hey...
- (IN DEEP VOICE) Hello.
- Oh, Marshall.
Thank God I got through!
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
- Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God, guess who just walked in?
Moby.
Moby?
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby!
Oh, no, I know Moby, and that's...
Does he have a gun?
Run!
Oh, my God.
Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
(GASPING FRANTICALLY)
Who was that guy?
Well, we know it's not Moby, and it's not Tony.
- Ranjit!
Drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
- Party number three!
Party number three.
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no.
You were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to, what?
That's right.
Re-psych.
Re...
Where's the...
Oh, my God, Not Moby took my get-psyched mix!
Barney, Barney, what the hell!
Barney, it's not worth it.
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
(TIRE BURSTING)
Oh, nuts.
Ranjit, you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire, we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
Guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed?
'Cause everyone's calling their loved ones.
Everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
Oh, sure.
Laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits, and cigars, and bimbos, and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your get-psyched mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We gotta stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
(SINGING YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME)
(RANJIT SINGING)
I'm gonna get some air.
It'll be fine, we'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm gonna head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
What?
No!
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but we...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
- And I can tell that she's into you, too.
- That's ridiculous.
- Wait, really?
- Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Marybeth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo, I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
I'm gonna call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
- Marshall!
Marshall!
- I'm sorry about your girl.
- Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Derek.
Hi, how's work?
Give you some privacy.
LILY:
Marshall!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Marshall!
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45, we celebrate the new year in Central Standard time.
Marshall!
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve, which is the single biggest letdown of a night, every single year.
- Marshall!
- Come on!
Come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got 10 minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Year's, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
- Marshall!
- MARSHALL:
Lily!
- Holy crap.
- Marshall!
(MARSHALL YELLING)
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three, so I walked.
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out, he signed my shirt.
And guess what I found?
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
- I know.
I know.
Come on.
- Come on.
Marshall.
Baby, baby.
I was so worried about you.
Why didn't you call me?
I tried, baby, all the circuits are jammed.
But, wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome!
I wanna cry.
It is so awesome.
- We have to go there.
- How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
- Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to wake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I'll get you there in six.
(HORNS HONKING)
I don't think I can do it.
- No, come on.
- No, come on.
- Move, you stupid taxi!
- Move...
- Three minutes!
Come on!
- Come on!
(CORK POPPING)
Ranjit, put her in park.
(EX CLAIMS)
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome.
But it's not the best party in New York, 'cause this is.
Right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- LILY:
Cheers.
- ROBIN:
Cheers.
- Cheers.
OLDER TED;
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve,
Funny thing is, all night long I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo,
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
Derek?
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Come on in.
Robin.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
- I can't believe you made it.
- I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
ALL:
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
OLDER TED;
You probably wanna feel bad for your old man at this point in the story,
Well, don't, Not every night has a happy ending,
But all of it's important, All of it was leading somewhere,
Because suddenly, it was 2006,
And 2006 was a big one,
Ted.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
He kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.
I had an idea of how to do it, too.
And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year we party together or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions and I narrowed them down to these five.
Question?
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
Thas an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?
Mary Beth?
Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight...
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
By who ?
Who asks you that?
And the answer is right here-- my own, personal "get psyched" mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
It's working.
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.
Derek.
He was like rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
Bye.
See ya next year.
Go get 'em.
Well, this kind of sucks.
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit!
- Party number one.
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.
Hi.
Mary Beth.
So great to meet you guys.
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.
American party friends of Barney's.
Oh, no.
So, Barney, who's your new friend?
Natalya.
Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a... rock?
- Ranjit!
Party number two.
- Party number two.
- Party number two?
- Not so good.
Let's go back to party number one.
No, no turning back.
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
!
- Sorry.
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up?
I'm sorry about Barney.
No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
Pfft.
Derek.
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl.
But... it was Robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.
No, this is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
Okay.
Now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
Oh, dude, not now!
What?
She needs to get psyched.
Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at...
a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.
You're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?
Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No.
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on.
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.
You don't know what you're missing.
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
Wait.
Baby, what are you doing?
- I'm going home.
- What?
No!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there.
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But... hot dogs.
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...
- party number three.
- Are you sure?
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
We'll find each other.
I know we will.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.
Eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the president.
Hey.
I'll bet you're feeling better now.
Oh, so much better.
Guys.
Is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.
No way.
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
Moby!
Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
- Hey.
- Hello.
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
- Wow.
You're friendly.
- Big fan.
Barney Stinson.
So, uh... what about this party?
It's just a New Year's thing.
You know, with some friends.
Wow, that sounds awesome.
You guys want to come?
Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.
Sidebar?
Um...
Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta...
I gotta find her.
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
But...
Come on!
Moby's party!
Moby's party!
Moby's par...
Ranjit.
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
I think it should be all rise.
Yes.
Moby...
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
I never leave home without it.
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.
Jan...
Aah!
So then I say,
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."
You're not Moby, are you?
Who?
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.
No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said "Tony."
So your name is Tony?
No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys going to come in?
Nah.
You're sure?
Come on.
It's going to get nuts in there.
There's this dude who owes me money.
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.
Why did we think that guy was Moby?
I don't know.
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
That's Marshall's phone.
Hello.
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
- He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God!
Guess who just walked in-
- Moby!
Moby?
!
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby.
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
Who was that guy?
!
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.
Ranjit, drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
Party number three!
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.
Re-psy...
Where's the...?
Oh, my God!
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
Ah, nuts.
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
I guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
Oh, sure, laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We got to stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
"Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling"
"You give love a bad name A bad name"
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"
It'll be fine.
We'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm going to head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
No.
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
And I can tell that she's into you, too.
That's ridiculous.
Wait.
Really?
Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
I'm sorry about your girl.
Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
Derek.
- Hi.
How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got ten minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
Holy crap.
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.
And guess what I found.
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.
How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I get you there in six.
I don't think I can do it.
No!
Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!
Three minutes!
Come on!
Ranjit, put her in park.
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York.
'Cause this is, right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo.
Derek?
!
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
I can't believe you made it.
I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure, it looks great on TV, but in reality, it's always just a big let down, but in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible, to give my friends a great New Year's Eve.
I had an idea of how to do it, too.
And all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right-- a limo.
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year we party together or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions and I narrowed them down to these five.
Question?
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
Thas an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.
All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?
Mary Beth?
Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight...
People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?"
By who ?
Who asks you that?
And the answer is right here-- my own, personal "get psyched" mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.

Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
It's working.
- I am definitely getting psyched.
- Oh, God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek.
Derek.
He was like rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
Bye.
See ya next year.
Go get 'em.
Well, this kind of sucks.
Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit!
- Party number one.
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.
Hi.
Mary Beth.
So great to meet you guys.
- My word.
- You're, you're friendly.
American party friends of Barney's.
Oh, no.
So, Barney, who's your new friend?
Natalya.
Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?
Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?
Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a... rock?
- Ranjit!
Party number two.
- Party number two.
- Party number two?
- Not so good.
Let's go back to party number one.
No, no turning back.
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
Yeah.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
!
- Sorry.
Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So while you may chose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up?
I'm sorry about Barney.
No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
Pfft.
Derek.
Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl.
But... it was Robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.
No, this is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
Okay.
Now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
Oh, dude, not now!
What?
She needs to get psyched.
Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin, you're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through.
So what ?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at...
a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Mary Beth.
You're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!
Oh, yes.
Ted, you rock.
We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?
Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No.
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on.
We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.
You don't know what you're missing.
Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.
Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
Wait.
Baby, what are you doing?
- I'm going home.
- What?
No!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there.
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But... hot dogs.
Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at...
- party number three.
- Are you sure?
- If I don't see you, happy new year.
- Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
We'll find each other.
I know we will.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh, yeah!
Look at us.
Riding around in a limo.
Eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the president.
Hey.
I'll bet you're feeling better now.
Oh, so much better.
Guys.
Is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.
Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young.
No way.
That's totally Moby.
That's awesome.
Should I say something?
I should say something, right?
Moby!
Hey, Moby!
Oh, my God.
He's coming over.
Everybody be cool.
Everybody be cool.
- Hey.
- Hello.
What's up?
Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?
Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.
You want a ride?
Sure.
Welcome.
- Wow.
You're friendly.
- Big fan.
Barney Stinson.
So, uh... what about this party?
It's just a New Year's thing.
You know, with some friends.
Wow, that sounds awesome.
You guys want to come?
Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Uh, Ted.
S idebar?
Um...
Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.
- That's New Year's Eve for you.
Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...
No, I-I can't.
Lily's waiting.
I gotta...
I gotta find her.
Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.
But...
Come on!
Moby's party!
Moby's party!
Moby's par...
Ranjit.
- Moby's party.
- Moby's party.
This is a cool mix.
You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall.
I think it should be all rise.
Yes.
Moby...
Yeah, it should start high, get higher.
This mix is my pride and joy.
I never leave home without it.
Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.
Jan...
Aah!
So then I say,
"your motorcycle was like that when I got here."
You're not Moby, are you?
Who?
Moby-- the recording artist, Moby.
No.
But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah."
I thought you said "Tony."
So your name is Tony?
No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys going to come in?
Nah.
You're sure?
Come on.
It's going to get nuts in there.
There's this dude who owes me money.
No, uh, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.
Why did we think that guy was Moby?
I don't know.
I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
That's Marshall's phone.
Hello.
Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
- He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God!
Guess who just walked in-
- Moby!
Moby?
!
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby.
Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo...
- Does he have a gun?
- Run!
Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
Who was that guy?
!
Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.
Ranjit, drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
Party number three!
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no, no you were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to... what?
That's right, re-psych.
Re-psy...
Where's the...?
Oh, my God!
Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix!
Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it!
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
Ah, nuts.
Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
I guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
Oh, sure, laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We got to stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
"Shot through the heart And you're to blame, darling"
"You give love a bad name A bad name"
- "I play my part and you played your game"
- I'm going to get some air.
"Darling, you give love a bad name, bad name!"
It'll be fine.
We'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm going to head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
No.
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
And I can tell that she's into you, too.
That's ridiculous.
Wait.
Really?
Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
- I'm going to call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
I'm sorry about your girl.
Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
D erek.
- Hi.
How's work?
- I'll give you some privacy.
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45.
We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.
Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got ten minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
Holy crap.
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked--
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out.
He signed my shirt.
And guess what I found.
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
Yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on!
Oh!
Oh!
Baby, baby, I was so worried about you.
- Why didn't you call me?
- I tried, baby.
All the circuits were jammed.
But wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome.
I want to cry, it is so awesome.
We have to go there.
How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
I didn't want to awake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I get you there in six.
I don't think I can do it.
No!
Come on!
Move, you stupid taxi!
Three minutes!
Come on!
Ranjit, put her in park.
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York.
'Cause this is, right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.
The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo.
Derek?
!
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, come on in.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
I can't believe you made it.
I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
Eh, he kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
OLDER TED:
Kids, the thing about New Year's Eve is that it sucks.
Sure it looks great on TV.
But in reality, it's always just a big letdown.
But in 2005, I attempted to do the impossible:
To give my friends a great New Year's Eve.
I had an idea of how to do it, too, and all it cost was half my Christmas bonus.
Yeah, that's right.
A limo.
- ROBIN:
Oh, man, Ted, this is great.
- Okay, people, let's talk strategy.
Last New Year's, we went our separate ways, and it sucked.
This year, we party together, or not at all.
Now, I sifted through your party submissions,
- and I narrowed them down to these five.
- Question.
Yes, Barney, your submissions were received, and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.
(ALL EXCLAIM)
But you enjoyed the e-vite, right?
That was an actual picture of my pants.
Yeah.
We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City, and that is where we will ring, nay, rock in the new year.
All right, and party number one, that's where we get to meet Marybeth?
- Marybeth?
- Oh, she works in my office.
She seems like she might be into me.
She's always finding reasons to hug me.
So tonight, we'll see... (CLEARING THROAT)
People often ask me, 'Barney, how is it that you're so psyched...
- 'so much of the time?
'
- By who?
Who asks you that?
(LAUGHING)
And the answer is right here.
My own, personal, get-psyched mix.
Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong.
It should be all rise, baby.
Now, prepare yourselves for an audio journey... into the white-hot center of adrenaline.
Bam.
(YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME PLAYING ON STEREO)...
- It's working.
- I'm definitely getting psyched.
God.
I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage.
Must do robot.
- Let's do this!
- Yes!
Let's!
Oh, driver?
Hello!
Hey, Ranjit!
Dude, you're driving a limo now.
That's awesome.
I've moved up in the world.
How do you guys know each other?
Oh, we rode in his cab one time.
It's a long story.
Hey, what are we waiting for?
We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.
Oh, I wish I could come with you guys, but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.
OLDER TED:
Oh, yeah, Robin was spending
New Year's with her boyfriend Derek.
Derek.
He was, like, rich, successful, handsome.
I hated that guy.
Oh, I'll miss you guys.
Have fun.
- ROBIN:
Bye.
- Happy New Year.
- Bye.
- Here we go.
- Oh, this kind of sucks.
- Okay, nobody get down.
We knew this going in.
We're a man down.
That just means were gonna have to party that much harder.
Ranjit.
Party number one.
- Party number one!
- Party number one!
I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets.
If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones.
Hey, we've got four more parties to hit.
If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.
We didn't really get a chance to meet.
I'm Lily, and this is my fiancé, Marshall.
Hi.
Marybeth.
It's so great to meet you guys.
- Oh, well, my word.
- Oh, hey.
Well, you're friendly.
(NATALYA LAUGHING)... (IN RUSSIAN ACCENT) Hello, American party friends of Barney's.
- Oh, no.
- So, Barney, who's your new friend?
- Natalya.
- Oh, friendly.
- So, where are you from, Natalya?
- She...
Who knows?
The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-off-her-ass-istan?
Super drunk fantastic, huh?
(MUMBLING)
Isn't she awesome?
- How are your feet doing, baby?
- Oh, okay.
I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep.
Can we swing by the apartment so I can change?
Come on, Lily.
We have a tightly scheduled evening... of awesomeness ahead of us.
I need you to power through the pain.
Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.
It's true.
I can hear them.
What's that, little boys?
What's that?
You wanna go for a rock?
(YELLING)...
- Ranjit, party number two!
- Party number two!
(ALL CHEERING)...
- Party number two, not so good.
- No, let's go back to party number one.
TED:
No, no turning back.
Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three!
- Yeah!
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
We have to turn around.
We left Natalya.
- Barney, none of us really liked her.
- What?
- Sorry.
- Oh, very nice, Lily.
You know, she is a guest in this country.
So, while you may choose to turn your back on her,
I choose to turn my front on her.
What up.
- I'm sorry about Barney.
- No, I'm having a great time.
I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight.
Me, too.
Just a sec.
(CELLPHONE RINGING)...
- Hey, Robin.
- Ted, Derek stood me up.
OLDER TED:
Derek.
Now we had a tight schedule to keep that night, and I was already on a date with another girl.
But it was Robin.
Ranjit, turn it around.
Hi.
Oh, God, I am so sorry about this.
You guys had your schedule, and I screwed it all up.
No.
This is perfect.
It's meant to be.
We're all back together.
What happened?
Oh, Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal.
Who works on New Year's Eve?
(COUGHING)
Okay, now I feel worse.
I was really looking forward to this night.
This sucks.
- Oh, dude, not now!
- What?
She needs to get psyched!
- Barney!
- Fine.
Maybe I should just go home.
Barney!
My finger slipped.
Look, Robin.
You're not going home.
Come on, it's New Year's Eve.
Look, so your date fell through, so what?
What do you need a date for?
Someone to kiss at midnight?
Fine.
I'll kiss you at a little bit after midnight.
- Hi, I'm Robin.
- Marybeth.
Oh, wow, you're friendly.
I haven't eaten dinner yet.
Is there anything to eat in this thing?
That's it.
I know what you're jonesing for.
- Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya.
- Oh, yes, Ted, you rock.
(STAMMERING) We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being,
- but we do have time for hot dogs?
- Yeah, we like hot dogs.
No.
No!
We are already behind schedule.
Ted, come on, we have an hour-and-a-half before midnight,
- and I don't wanna be kissing Ranjit.
- You don't know what you're missing.
- Come on.
It's only a 20-minute detour.
- Which is exactly how much time I need.
- Ranjit, stop the car.
- Stopping the car.
- Wait, baby, what are you doing?
- No, I'm going home.
- What?
No!
- No, you can't, Lily!
I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't.
There's a cab over there,
I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.
But hot dogs.
Oh, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.
- Okay, I'll go with you.
- No, baby.
Baby, you go with them, and I'll meet you at party number three.
- Are you sure?
- Lf I don't see you, Happy New...
Don't say that.
We'll find each other.
- We'll find each other.
- I know we will.
MARSHALL:
Bye, Lil.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hell of a woman.
Let's go get some hot dogs!
- Ranjit, party number three.
- Party number three.
- Oh yeah!
- Look at us, riding around in a limo, eating hot dogs.
It's like we're the President.
- Hey, I bet you're feeling better now.
- Oh, so much better.
Guys, is that Moby?
I think that that's Moby.

I'm Barney Stinson.
So, what about this party?
Oh, it's just a New Year's thing with some friends.
Wow.
That sounds awesome.
- You guys wanna come?
- Yeah, we'd love to.
- All right.
- Ted.
- Sidebar.
- Moby, switch up, will you?
Yeah, what's up?
- What about Lily?
- Call her.
I've been trying to call her.
I can't get through.
- All the circuits are jammed.

Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party, and then, afterwards...
No, I can't.

I gotta find her.

But when we said, 'Hey, Moby,' you said, 'Yeah.'
I thought you said, 'Tony.'

- No.
Oh, hey, we're here.
All right.
You guys gonna come in?
- No.
- You sure?
Come on, it's gonna get nuts in there.
It's this dude who owes me money.
No, we're good.
We're good.
Happy New Year, Not Moby.
Oh, hey, hey.
Be safe.
(EXHALES)...
- Why did we think that guy was Moby?
- I don't know.
I see a short, bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
That's Marshall's phone.
Hey...
- (IN DEEP VOICE) Hello.
- Oh, Marshall.
Thank God I got through!
- Hey, sexy.
- Barney, where's Marshall?
He left his phone in the limo.
He's out looking for you.
- What?
Where?
- Party number three.
Well, I'm here at party number three and...
Oh, my God, guess who just walked in?
Moby.
Moby?
She's upstairs.
Lily, you have to get out of there this instant.
That's not Moby!
Oh, no, I know Moby, and that's...
Does he have a gun?
Run!
Oh, my God.
Not Moby's party is party number four.
What are the odds?
(GASPING FRANTICALLY)
Who was that guy?
Well, we know it's not Moby, and it's not Tony.
- Ranjit!
Drive!
- Where to?
- Party number three!
- Party number three!
Party number three.
No, but I was just at party number three.
No, no, no.
You were at party number four.
You must have looked at the list wrong.
Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for?
It's time to, what?
That's right.
Re-psych.
Re...
Where's the...
Oh, my God, Not Moby took my get-psyched mix!
Barney, Barney, what the hell!
Barney, it's not worth it.
Let it go.
We need to get back on schedule.
(TIRE BURSTING)
Oh, nuts.
Ranjit, you sure I can't help?
No.
I am pissed.
Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.
Okay.
Okay, not a problem.
He'll jack it up, slap on a tire, we'll be at party number three in no time.
I wish Marshall would call.
Guess the circuits are jammed.
Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed?
'Cause everyone's calling their loved ones.
Everyone around the world.
Everyone except Barney.
(ROBIN LAUGHING)
Oh, sure.
Laugh.
Laugh for Barney Stinson.
Laugh for the sad clown... trapped on his whirling carousel of suits, and cigars, and bimbos, and booze.
Round and round it goes.
And where's it all heading?
Nowhere.
Is this just 'cause you lost your get-psyched mix?
I'm sorry.
Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?
No.
No, not tonight.
Not in the limo.
We gotta stay psyched.
Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's.
(SINGING YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME)...
(RANJIT SINGING)
I'm gonna get some air.
It'll be fine, we'll be out of here in a jiff.
Ted, I'm gonna head out.
My roommates are having a party not far from here.
What?
No!
Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but we...
How long have you been in love with Robin?
I'm not in love...
We're just friends.
Where are you getting that from?
Ted, it's okay.
I'm fine.
- And I can tell that she's into you, too.
- That's ridiculous.
- Wait, really?
- Happy New Year, Ted.
I can't believe Marybeth left before midnight.
Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party.
It's no big deal.
The first time I rode in a limo, I was five.
I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral.
I suppose, in a way, I still am.
Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here.
I'm gonna call Marshall.
- But he left his phone.
- Marshall!
Marshall!
- I'm sorry about your girl.
- Sorry about your guy.
Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight.
Did you forget about our little deal?
Because I did not.
I did not, too.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Derek.
Hi, how's work?
Give you some privacy.
LILY:
Marshall!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Marshall!
Okay, how's this for a plan?
We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45, we celebrate the new year in Central Standard time.
Marshall!
- Give it a rest, Ted.
- Give what a rest?
Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve, which is the single biggest letdown of a night, every single year.
- Marshall!
- Come on!
Come on, we can still turn this thing around.
We've still got 10 minutes.
Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Year's, Ted.
It doesn't exist.
- Marshall!
- MARSHALL:
Lily!
- Holy crap.
- Marshall!
(MARSHALL YELLING)
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually.
So much to tell.
I couldn't find Lily at party number three, so I walked.
I walked to the next party on the list.
- Not Moby's party?
- Yes, Moby's party.
Check it out, he signed my shirt.
And guess what I found?
Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it.
- I know.
I know.
Come on.
- Come on.
Marshall.
Baby, baby.
I was so worried about you.
Why didn't you call me?
I tried, baby, all the circuits are jammed.
But, wait, there's more.
After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five.
And so I went there, too, and it is awesome!
I wanna cry.
It is so awesome.
- We have to go there.
- How?
We'll never get a cab.
The flat's fixed.
Let's do this!
Come on!
In!
Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!
- Natalya?
Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time.
- Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want to wake her.
She looked so peaceful.
Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town.
Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?
I'll get you there in six.
(HORNS HONKING)
I don't think I can do it.
- No, come on.
- No, come on.
- Move, you stupid taxi!
- Move...
- Three minutes!
Come on!
- Come on!
(CORK POPPING)
Ranjit, put her in park.
(EXCLAIMS)
Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome.
But it's not the best party in New York, 'cause this is.
Right here.
- Cheers.
Well said.
- LILY:
Cheers.
- ROBIN:
Cheers.
- Cheers.
OLDER TED:
And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve.
Funny thing is, all night long I'd been trying to chase something down... that was right there in that limo.
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
Derek?
Derek.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Come on in.
Robin.
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.
- I can't believe you made it.
- I made it, baby.
I super love you, okay?
Here, you need a mint.
ALL:
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
OLDER TED:
You probably wanna feel bad for your old man at this point in the story.
Well, don't.
Not every night has a happy ending.
But all of it's important.
All of it was leading somewhere.
Because suddenly, it was 2006.
And 2006 was a big one.
Ted.
What the hell, man?
I thought we had a deal.
What about your guy?
It's midnight.
Go kiss him.
He kept me waiting.
I can keep him waiting.
Well, a deal is a deal.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
Oh, that's, uh- That's my pillow.
What?
That pillow behind you.
That one-
That one's mine.
Well, there's two perfectly good pillows right there.
No way.
This one's too puffy, and this one's too flat.
Can I have my pillow, please?
I need it.
It's perfect for my special head needs.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm all set up here.
So why don't you lay your special head on one of these pillows, close your eyes and fall asleep.
Okay, is that what you think happens here every night?
I just... close my eyes and fall asleep?
Yeah.
That's pretty much how it goes down.
Okay, Carrie, that is my pillow, and I want her now.
And I am telling you, Doug, that I'm... not... moving.
I don't care.
Yeah.
You know what?
You are such a baby.
Yeah?
Here, here, here.
And now I'm gonna sleep like one too.
Actually, I think that's my pillow, right there.
Gin rummy, you and me, right now.
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad.
I have to finish this report.
You can keep dealing'.
I'm still not playin'.
Dad, if you have nothing to do, why don't you go down to the senior center?
No.
Not as along as George Barksdale is president.
He picks the movies, he picks the pudding, and if ya cross him, good luck in getting a bingo card.
Well, if you're so unhappy, why don't you just say something?
The last guy who did that was "accidentally" run over by a Rascal scooter.
Barksdale's goons are everywhere.
I'm tellin' ya I gave it back to you.
No, you didn't.
You came a long way for some humble pie.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Car.
Hey.
Deacon seems to think we have his Earth, Wind Fire box set.
Now, you haven't seen it, right?
Yes.
It's right there on the bookshelf.
I told you to give it back to him.
Thanks.
Okay, was, uh... this not clear to you?
Anyway, I'm gonna head out.
What ya talkin' about?
We were gonna watch the Knicks.
I gotta get up early to take that personnel evaluation test at work.
No
- No, they didn't tell you?
It's
- It's optional.
I know.
I'm still taking it.
Okay, do you know what "optional" means?
I don't wanna be a driver my whole life.
Here's a chance for me to improve myself and move up in the company.
I think I can get up an hour earlier for that.
Yeah?
Well, while you're improving yourself,
I'll be laying in bed holding in a bladder full of pee.
What's this test Deacon's talking about?
It's nothin'.
He said it can help you move up in the company.
How come you're not taking it?
Does anybody know what "optional" means?
It's not for a specific promotion.
It's just some kind of general aptitude thing.
Oh, I see.
So you're taking yourself out of the running for any promotion ever?
From your lips to his ears.
Look, Carrie, I'd probably do lousy at it anyway.
Well, how do you know if you don't even try, Doug?
We've been married for 10 years, but I've never seen you really try for anything.
Believe me, I've tried for things.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You did try to finish Newark's biggest burrito.
It would've been free.
All right, forget it.
Sorry I even brought it up.
You know, I did try for something once.
It was 1989, and I was working as bouncer at this place called Poison, one of the hottest clubs in Queens.
But what I really wanted to be... was a bartender.
The movie Cocktail was taking the world by storm and dishing out booze was the coolest job a guy could have.
Then finally one night, my boss said the magic words I'd been waiting to hear.
"Mike called in sick.
"He ate some bad salmon.
He's been on the toilet all day. "
I finally got my shot.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ya understand now?
Well, I don't remember Cocktail taking the world by storm, but other than that, yeah, I guess.
Let me tell ya.
I learned something that night.
You don't try for things, you don't get hurt.
Doug, is this all because of what happened 15 years ago at some stupid club?
Stupid?
Okay.
Stupid clu-
That's why Bell, Biv and DeVoe were regulars.
All I'm saying, in my career, okay,
I try for things, and yet I fail, and it hurts, but I keep trying.
You wanna know why?
You're a slow learner?
No, because I want a better life for us.
Better?
Doug, please.
Carrie, I don't know what you want from me.
I'm just a truck driver, and I'm fine with that.
Why can't you be?
Because I don't think you're just a truck driver, Doug.
I think you're a smart, talented guy who could do anything he wants to.
I just wish you felt the same way.
I did it.
Did what?
I thought about what you said last night, and you're right.
I shouldn't be afraid to try something, so I went out, and I did it.
You took the I.P.S. test?
No, no- I enrolled in bartending school.
Bartending school?
Yeah, it's a two-week course.
I already called Paddy down at Cooper's.
He's gonna give me some shifts as soon as I get my certification.
Doug, you're gonna be a bartender and quit your job at I.P.S.?
No, no, not yet.
But, hey, who knows where this wild ride is gonna take us, you know?
You know, I- I don't want a wild ride.
Maybe someday we'll have our own bar.
We can call it...
"Doug's Place. "
Slow down, honey-
Or I can change my name to Melrose, and we can call it "Melrose Place. "
Hey, guys.
What's going on?
I'm going back to school.
Oh, great!
Yeah, bartending school.
Ooh, better yet.
Bravo, Douglas.
And while we're making announcements,
I've decided to run for senior center president.
Good for you.
Yes.
I'm going to end Barksdale's reign of terror and begin my own.
All right, see you guys later.
All right.
Bartender.
Rarr!
Doug, you have a union job with a pension and health benefits.
You can't throw all that away.
That's crazy.
I know it's crazy, but you told me I'm talented, and I'm great, and you said I could do whatever I wanted, right?
Yes.
If you believe in me, that's all I need.
Mwah!
Ha-ha!
Crap.
All right, everybody, settle down.
So... you people think you have what it takes, huh?
Think ya can cut it?
Think ya got the right stuff?
Is this the 1-2-3 bartending class?
Get out.
Huh?
Get out!
You thought this was gonna be easy.
Well, let me tell ya something.
One out of three of you ain't gonna make it through this course.
So I want you to look at the person to your left and look at the person to your right, because one of those people ain't gonna be here tomorrow, and that person could-
Where you lookin', meat?
I, uh
- I-I-I didn't have anybody to my right, so I just-
You
- You know what?
I'll go-
Sit down.
I'm gonna sit down.
All right.
Let's dive in.
Rule number one:
A depressed customer is the best customer.
Good job, huh?
Hey.
I ain't shakin' your hand, meat.
You're not?
Come here.
Ha-ha!
Huh?
Hey!
Yeah!
There he is, the smug despot, drunk with power.
All right, Holly, you're my campaign manager.
Let's get goin'.
Okay, well, I guess you should tell people why you're running.
What's your platform?
Essentially, my platform is
I'd like to be president very badly.
Okay, but the voters are gonna wanna know what you're gonna do once you're elected.
That's none of their business.
Okay, here we go.
What can I get you?
Uh, club soda, please.
Yeah.
What is it?
Oh, it's just that I... just graduated from bartending school, and you're my first customer.
Well, that's great.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping that my first drink would be memorable.
You know, like a mai tai or a Bermuda rum swizzle.
Yeah.
Uh, look, I
- I-
I got a little drinking problem, you know, so I'd-
I'd just rather not, yeah.
Guy, just one.
Double scotch, neat.
There you go.
Alrighty.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, what can I get for ya?
Just a Bud Light.
Uh, you know I do serve 16 kinds of beer from Europe, heh.
Great.
You're a regular Epcot Center.
Just give me a Bud Light.
Comin' right up.
Here we go.
Oh.
All right.
Ahem.
Okay, uh
- Whoa!
Okay.
Whoa-ho.
That's, uh- That's half price, that one right there.
That's half price.
I mean, I just don't know what to do.
Should I talk to Steve?
Should I not talk to Steve?
I mean, is he ever gonna change?
Uh, you know, ladies, those drinks come with free advice, and man problems... is my specialty.
Oh.
Well, can you tell me how to get my husband to stop sleeping with every woman he meets and spend about 10 minutes with his own son?
No, but let me set you ladies up with some beer nuts.
Hey.
So... how'd it go?
I did good.
Great.
I'm officially a bartender's wife.
Just what I've always wanted, a husband who reeks of olives.
Actually, you're gonna have that either way.
But don't worry.
I'm giving up bartending.
I'm gonna stick with I.P.S.
Really?
Yeah.
I don't know.
All these years,
I built up bartending to be such this magical thing.
You know, it turns out it's just a-
Another stupid job.
I'll tell ya, I'm glad I did it, though, 'cause 15 years ago, oh, I screwed up bigtime, you know?
And tonight I just proved that I could do it, you know?
I
- I just conquered my demon.
Did you, uh... make this all tonight in tips?
Actually, more.
On the way home,
I hit an Arby's drive-through pretty hard.
Are you sure you're not giving up on this bartending thing a little too soon?
What are you talking about?
You said it was a dumb idea.
Yeah, but that was before... eh!
I mean... honey, if you can make all this in one night in some crappy bar in Queens, just think what you can make in Manhattan.
As a matter of fact, there's a bar next-door to where I work.
I know the owner.
I can get you in there.
No, that's it.
I'm done with this whole thing.
I'm over it.
I conquered my demon.
I don't think you did.
What are ya-?
What are you talkin' about?
I conquered the crap out of it.
No.
No, I don't think you- You conquered your demon at all.
You know, now that I think about it, your demon wasn't not trying, you know, it was quitting.
Yeah, that's your demon right there.
Quitter.
No, no, no, that's not my demon.
I'll tell ya what my demon is.
My demon is you.
Come on, Doug.
All we've been talking about is your dreams.
What about my dreams?
I've always wanted to live in Manhattan,
If we had more money, we could do that.
Look, I want you to be happy, okay?
Maybe I'll- I'll take that I.P.S. test, and I can move up through the company-
Okay, you know what?
If I hear one more word about that stupid I.P.S. test, I'm gonna puke.
Come on, honey.
We could do this.
I mean, we'll have my salary.
You'll be working in the bar four or five times a week.
In this dream, uh, am I also working at I.P.S.?
Manhattan ain't cheap, babe.
Okay?
This is a whole new life for us!
Yeah, but if I'm working all the time, you'll never see me.
Yeah, but I'll have eh-heh!
Thank you very much.
Ah, Josephine, my dear,
I hope I can count on your vote.
Oh, well, actually I'm voting for Mr. Barksdale.
I think he's doing a very nice job.
I see.
Welcome to my enemies list.
Spooner.
I understand you've been questioning my war record.
I just think people have a right to know why you didn't serve in Vietnam.
Because I was 60.
Sixty or just plain yella?
How are we doing in the polls?
Ten people say they're gonna vote for you, 16 for Barksdale, and three for McGovern.
There's my problem.
He's got the black vote all sewn up.
Not much you can do about that.
Or... is there?
Hey, what's going on?
You said there was some sort of emergency.
Ah, Deacon, slap it high.
What?
How's by you, my talented and very equal friend?
Wh-what exactly is the emergency?
Well, actually it was an emergency of the heart.
I haven't seen you since the Million Man March, and I need a hug.
Now.
What the hell's goin' on?
All right, look, I'm running for senior center president, and I need the black vote to win.
Play ball, and you and your family will have powdered milk for the rest of your lives.
What?
Do you know how insulting this is?
Hey, everybody,
Arthur Spooner is a bad man.
You hear that, everyone?
I'm bad!
They keep coming!
Why is everyone so thirsty?
You're doing great, just move a little faster, honey.
Hey.
Great bartender, huh?
Cute too, don't you think?
He's kinda sweaty.
And I ain't hatin' it.
Whoa.
Fifty-cent tip.
How am I gonna get to Manhattan with that?
Doug, do that.
Do what he's doing.
What?
Do the bottle flip.
The only time I did that move was in class, and it was with a Nerf bottle.
Do it for me, baby, please?
Hey!
Okay.
So the bartending didn't work out as well as we hoped.
But you're still great, and you're still talented.
Okay, you know what?
Tomorrow morning, you are gonna march in there, and you are gonna take that I.P.S. test, and you're gonna show 'em what's what.
Oh.
Yeah.
"Employee demonstrates no special skills
"or potential for advancement.
"His qualifications for his current job are questionable at best. "
Well... now we know.
Spooner.
Hello, Barksdale.
Congratulations on your unanimous victory.
I hope we can put all this ugliness behind us.
'Fraid not.
Just not in the face.
[Dennis] Another big night, fellas... $ 164.87.
- [Mac] That's not a lot of money.
- No, it isn't.
- And our mortgage is due in two weeks.
- We paid that a week ago.
A week ago was three weeks late, Mac.
Hey, guys.
I met this guy in acting class.
He's really cool, and he wants to see where I work.
So could you guys try to not be weird?
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I love you guys, but sometimes you're not that cool.
- We're cool!
- Not cool?
- Try to be cool.
- Sometimes you're not too cool.
- Charlie...
- Always cool, man.
- Oh, hey, man, we're closed.
- Yeah, I know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We don't want any trouble.
- What?
Guys, this is Terrell... from my acting class.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, man.
How's it goin'?
- It's going good.
How you doin'?
- Good, man.
- We're just chillin', dude.
- Great.
- Just closing up shop.
- Yeah.
[Mutters] Whoa.
Guess you guys don't have too many brothers walking through here.
- Oh, no, no.
- We got plenty of brothers.
Yeah...
A-African-Americans.
- Okay.
Yeah, we get it.
- [Overlapping Chatter]
You might know some of them.
Yeah.
We're probably related.
No.
I don't think he was implying that you guys are all related.
That's ridiculous.
Sweet Dee came in here a second ago and started talking about acting class.
- We weren't expecting you...
- We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.
Right.
Thanks, guys.
When I'm promoting: everybody and their mama gonna be there.
There's gonna be brothers, white boys, Latinos, whatever.
You got niggas hanging from the rafters.
So we got 400-plus packed into this tiny little place...
Whoa.
You had 400 people packed into a place?
You damn right.
That's my job, man.
And it's mostly college kids.
My sister goes to Temple, so I got the hookup over there.
And hookups are good.
But, just to be clear, when you say your sister, do you mean your sister or your friend...
- Dude.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I mean my sister.
- Oh.
Okay.
Cool.
I was just...
Because he could mean his friend or his...
Stop talking.
So we're packed into this little place on Walnut.
We're halfway through the night, everything's goin' all right.
All of a sudden, I notice this dude eyeballin' me from across the bar.
- Shit.
- I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me.
- He's giving you crazy eyes.
- The insane, crazy eyes.
- Right?
- I know that.
So I walk over...
He's this big, cut Mexican dude... and I look at him and say, "Yo, ese... unless you want to get yo' ass torn apart... you'd better get that look off your face."
- [Giggles] No!
- You just walked right up to him and said that?
I had to, man.
You gotta make the first move.
- Always make the first move.
You know what I'm sayin'?
- l-I know.
- So what happened?
- Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down.
We're, like, eyeball to eyeball.
His grill is right up in mine.
It feels like an eternity.
Finally... he just opens up his mouth and says...
[Mexican Accent] " I guess you gon' have to tear my ass apart, homes."
- [Mouthing Words]
- Oh, man.
So what'd you do?
Took him to the back alley... and I tore his ass apart!
- Oh, my God!
- [All Chattering]
That's insane!
[Chattering Continues]
Okay, I would like to do things like that.
I love that guy.
"I took him to the back alley"?
- Who does shit like that?
It's like a movie.
- There's something off about him.
- Oh, bro, that's racist.
- No, asshole, that's not what I meant.
- I'll go get the coffee.
What do you guys want?
- Dude, sit down.
Okay?
Wait till the waitress comes out here, and then you can stare at her.
- I wasn't gonna stare at her.
I was just gonna...
- He wasn't gonna stare at her.
- You're totally obsessed with that chick.
- No, I'm not.
I like her.
I have a little bit of a crush, yes.
But obsessed?
That's a bit of a harsh word.
- It's never gonna happen.
- Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.
- Why?
For what?
- You heard him.
When he's promoting', everybody named Mama's looking to get in.
That's true.
They do have "niggers hanging from rafters."
- Wow.
Nice.
- No, that's not what I was saying.
- Coffee?
- Yeah.
- Hitler?
- No, I'm not...
I'm not Adolf Hitler.
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.
- Okay.
- [Exhales]
Well, that's just great.
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it?
Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at 200 people.
- Yeah, that's true.
- It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.
All right, let's do it.
- Sure about this?
- It's 2005, Charlie.
Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have no friends outside of your own race?
- No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid!
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not...
This is a college campus.
This is a great place to meet people of different cultures, diversify...
You're just trying to make black...
Mm-hmm.
You're trying to make black friends.
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.
Don't do this right now.
- ?
[Hip-hop] - [Chattering, Laughing]
Okay.
See?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
- This is perfect.
- Huh.
Yeah.
- I'm gonna break the ice.
- Go for it.
'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.
'Bout to bust that shit up, boy!
Absolutely.
- Okay, that didn't go exactly the way...
- No.
- No.
It was really awkward.
- Really awkward.
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah!
- Hey, what's your name?
- Oh.
It's, uh, Charlie.
Do you play bones, Charlie?
I dabble.
Do you want to play?
I could get you a game.
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so...
- I bet you're really good.
- Well, it's been a long time, you know.
- Oh, come on.
- All right.
One game.
Domino, bitch!
[Laughing, Chattering]
This is bullshit.
Absolute bullshit.
- Why do these people like you more than they like me?
- Maybe it's comments like that.
I meant those people in there, not all black people.
What am I supposed to say?
You should say something different.
Figure something else out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Um, I'm Janell.
- Oh, hi.
- Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.
- Thanks.
You know.
I wanted to give you this.
- Oh.
Okay.
- You know?
- Give me a call sometime.
All right?
- Yeah.
Sure.
- Well, you...
- [Whistles]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing, dude?
- What?
That girl's gorgeous.
She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're not racist.
She probably has friends for me.
Well, if anything, I think we should be focused on black men, first of all.
What?
We don't really need...
We need black guys, so...
- Black guys?
What are you talking about?
- You know.
Is this about that waitress at the coffee shop, dude?
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
- No, I'm not.
- Let me see your wallet.
- Why?
- Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?
- No.
Give it to me.
Give it...
Oh, my God!
Stop making a scene!
Just give me the wallet!
Give me the wallet!
I can't get the goddamn...
It's okay!
It's okay, everybody!
- You're making a scene.
- You're making a scene!
I got it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hold on a second.
- Ha!
Ha-ha!
Ha!
- Give it to me!
He had it!
Okay!
You found it!
- I'm gonna tear it up!
- [Shrieks] No, don't!
Just give me it.
I'll call the black girl.
Okay?
Okay, buddy.
We're cool.
We're cool.
We're good.
Thanks, guys.
See ya.
I had the craziest dream last night that I was in Cleveland, Ohio... which is really weird, because I've never even been to Ohio.
This guy was wearing a bunny suit, and he was coming out...
You know what, Dee?
I don't wanna hear about your dreams.
Okay?
I hate listening to people's dreams.
It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's having sex, I just...
I don't care.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.
- 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
- I'm sorry.
I am.
- Hey!
What's goin' on, guys?
- [Dennis] Terrell.
- How are you?
- Hey!
What's up?
What's up?
How you doin'?
Dennis!
What's goin' on?
- All right, man.
- How's it goin', man?
Good, man.
Listen, um, you mind stepping outside with me for a second, man?
- Yeah, I'll come outside.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Well, come on.
I'm gonna put these out on the tables.
Rule number one:
Always keep a line.
[Dennis] Oh, my God!
That is a lot of people!
Wow!
?
[Disco]
- This is crazy!
- I know!
I told you!
Terrell's the best!
I'm gonna have to start bartending full-time.
L-Look at this!
- Why are you making more money than me?
- I don't know!
- Hey, this is crazy!
- I know.
Terrell packed 'em in.
Look at this.
- This is crazy!
- Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.
- Lot of dudes.
- Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.
Lot of dudes.
What can I get you boys?
- Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
- What cute one?
Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett by the jukebox?
- Oh, yeah!
- Let's go say hey.
- Yo, Brettie boy!
- Hey, cuz!
- Hey!
How you doin'?
- What's up, Brett?
Can you believe this crowd?
- Oh, it's something else!
- Yeah!
Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested.
I actually got a couple of services I'd like to request.
Whoa!
Uh, what are you doin, man?
I'm not...
- You have the most beautiful eyes.
- Okay, man, but I'm...
Really?
So blue.
Really more of a blue-green, actually, but...
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Yeah, thanks.
- You've come a long way.
- What do you mean?
You guys are running the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
?
[Continues]
[Knocking]
[Grunting]
No!
What in the hell is your problem?
How could you not tell me you were gay?
I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.
I've been coming on to you for weeks now.
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.
- I am not into gay dudes!
- Apparently you are.
- Okay, well, you know what?
The guys hired you to promote their bar, and you turned it into a gay bar.
They are not happy.
[Laughing, Whooping]
- So much money!
- Whoo!
Oh!
So much money!
We made more money in one night...
Th-Than in the entire time that we've owned this place!
We have to embrace the situation.
We should totally embrace the situation!
- We're a gay bar from now on.
- Absolutely, man!
No goddamn way.
Have you guys seen this?
"Looking for that new hot spot to spot that stud?
Well, Paddy's Irish Pub has plugged that hole."
- That's a nice notice.
- No, it's not nice.
I don't want to be plugging anybody's holes.
- I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.
- Of course you are.
I made $300 last night.
How much did you make?
First of all, that's rude.
And that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
It has everything to do with it.
I don't think we have much of a choice.
We need to do this.
If you guys remember, one of the major reasons we got this bar was to get laid.
Maybe you did it to get laid.
I got a little something I like to call business ethics.
Business ethics?
The only reason you don't care is you have black girls hanging all over you.
Okay, chill out.
You're gonna screw it up.
Screw it up?
I happen to have a date with a nice young lady today.
- Ouch.
- It's a purely fiscal decision.
Oh, bullshit.
You don't care about the money.
You just like the attention.
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- "Everybody look at me!"
You know exactly what I mean, pretty boy.
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, hoss.
- I just get along really well with those guys.
- They're vibing.
No, you're leading them on.
You're not gay, you're just really vain.
Okay, time out.
Here's what we should do.
Let's take a vote.
- Fine.
- [Mac] Okay.
All those in favor of Paddy's Pub remaining a gay bar, say "aye."
- Aye.
- Aye.
Opposed?
- K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why?
- Because you're the bartender.
You're not one of the owners.
- No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.
- No, she doesn't!
- Of course I get a vote!
[All Arguing]
All owners opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed... say "nay."
Nay.
- Two against one!
Oh, well.
- Ohh!
Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
- Hey-hey!
What's going on?
- Hey!
- Look at you!
You look good!
- Oh, thank you.
That's so sweet.
- So, where we going?
- Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.
- Oh, I want one so bad.
- All righty!
Oh, a coffee shop.
I thought you meant, like, a drink at a bar.
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, why don't you have a seat here.
I'll go get the coffee.
What would you like?
- I don't really drink coffee.
Let me see.
- Totally.
What do you want, Charlie?
"What do you want, Charlie?"
I'd like you to take a look at the lovely young African-American woman... sitting at the table over there.
Okay.
That woman is my friend.
Wow.
Good for you.
So, the other day when you heard me saying something... about certain people hanging from said rafters...
I was quoting a friend of mine who also happens...
What are you trying to say?
Spit it out.
Well, now that you know that I'm not racist, you and I could maybe go on...
Dude, N-O.
- How many times do I have to say it to you?
- One time is fine.
- Apparently one time is not fine.
- One time per time I ask you.
Hey, what's going on up here?
Oh, not too much.
Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist.
Then he asked me out on a date.
Charlie, is this true?
Would that upset you if it was something that was true?
- ?
[Disco] - [Groans]
- You need to see a doctor.
This thing looks really bad.
- I did!
- What'd he say?
- He said thatJanell punched me in my eye!
All right, well, you need to keep that i...
- Wait.
Her name's Janell?
- Yeah.
JanellJenkins.
She's got a hell of a right hand.
She also said if she ever saw me again, she was going to slit my throat.
Are you two seeing this?
Boys are out tonight, huh?
This is unbelievable.
What is going on here?
You got black women crawling all over you... and this Mary here is the belle of the ball.
- Why do these people like you guys so much?
- It's not that they like us.
It's that they don't like you.
You know why?
Uh, because you're an asshole!
Is that true?
Yeah, kind of.
Can I talk to you in back for a second?
- What's up?
- You know that girlJanell?
I know her.
- Okay.
So what?
- So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.
Great.
How?
We gotta start with Dennis.
Can you get him so drunk tonight?
On tequila.
But a lot of it.
Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.
- Yeah, sure.
No problem.
- All right.
- Where are you going?
- I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.
But seriously...
blackout drunk.
All right.
Okay.
So you did the lime first, and then the shot, right?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Dude.
- You take the salt...
- Take the salt.
and then you take the shot.
- Okay.
- [Spits]
- And then you suck on the lime.
Okay?
- Okay.
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.
- You lick it.
- Salt.
Lick it.
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah?
[Hiccups]
Oh, that's great.
All right, so, I'm gonna do the shot first...
No, no, no, no...
Oh...
Oh, please, please, dude.
You're not listening to me.
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not...
The salt first.
Then the lime.
[Alarm Beeping]
[Whimpers]
[Alarm Stops]
[Groans]
Oh, God.
[Groans]
Hello.
Mmm.
[Sighs] Nice.
[Sighs] Beautiful.
[Both Moaning]
- Hello, lover.
- [Screams]
Whoa!
What the hell!
What is going on here?
Relax, stud.
You got nothing to be ashamed about.
What the f...
What does that mean?
- Did we have...
- No.
No.
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.
How's that ass feelin'?
[Charlie] I'm really glad you decided to embrace this.
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.
- I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah!
I don't want to own a gay bar anymore.
What, dude?
Oh, no.
What happened?
Just, uh...
I was doing some thinking and, you know...
We had our little experiment.
It was great.
But we should go back to normal.
Oh.
You had an experiment, and you want to go back to the way it was before the experiment.
- Interesting.
- The bar.
We had our experiment with the bar, and it was great.
Let's go back to normal.
You're done experimenting?
Or are you gonna experiment some more?
- What is this experimenting?
- Hey, Dennis!
What's up?
Listen, I got you some new CDs.
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox was a little bit stale.
Also, we gotta get rid of these shamrocks.
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks like Irish crap.
- Can we talk for a second in private?
- Yeah.
No problem.
So, listen, Terrell, it's not really working out.
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.
No, we were happy.
But then Dennis had an experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.
Yeah, we had that experiment...
Why do you keep saying it like that?
You guys are being ridiculous.
Yeah, we're being ridiculous!
We're making a lot of money!
- Yes!
Thank you!
- Look, everybody!
Sweet Dee's here!
- Hey, everybody!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
What are you doing here?
- Charlie?
- What is going on here?
You guys know each other?
Yeah!
That's the crazy bitch that punched me in my eye!
Charlie!
That's my sister.
Now, just to clarify, when you say "sister," you mean...
I mean my sister.
Yes!
Okay!
This is great!
Because earlier you were implying that I was racist... because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related.
And then it turns out that you people actually are!
No, that's not what I meant.
Hold on a second.
I meant that you two actually are.
Mac?
Stop talkin'.
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12, hundred and 13... $114!
- On a Saturday night!
- We're back to normal.
We are back to normal.
Mmm.
Dee, I gotta know.
What, exactly, did you tell those guys from your acting class to do to Dennis?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.
- What?
- Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.
Then why was he so freaked out?
How's that ass feelin'?
[Voices Speaking Backwards]
Another big night, fellas... $ 164.87.
- That's not a lot of money.
- No, it isn't.
- And our mortgage is due in two weeks.
- We paid that a week ago.
A week ago was three weeks late, Mac.
Hey, guys.
I met this guy in acting class.
He's really cool, and he wants to see where I work.
So could you guys try to not be weird?
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I love you guys, but sometimes you're not that cool.
- We're cool!
- Not cool?
- Try to be cool.
- Sometimes you're not too cool.
- Charlie...
- Always cool, man.
- Oh, hey, man, we're closed.
- Yeah, I know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We don't want any trouble.
- What?
Guys, this is Terrell... from my acting class.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, man.
How's it goin'?
- It's going good.
How you doin'?
- Good, man.
- We're just chillin', dude.
- Great.
- Just closing up shop.
- Yeah.
Whoa.
Guess you guys don't have too many brothers walking through here.
- Oh, no, no.
- We got plenty of brothers.
Yeah...
A-African-Americans.
Okay.
Yeah, we get it.
You might know some of them.
Yeah.
We're probably related.
No.
I don't think he was implying that you guys are all related.
That's ridiculous.
Sweet Dee came in here a second ago and started talking about acting class.
- We weren't expecting you...
- We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.
Right.
Thanks, guys.
When I'm promoting', everybody and their mama gonna be there.
There's gonna be brothers, white boys, Latinos, whatever.
You got niggas hanging from the rafters.
So we got 400-plus packed into this tiny little place...
Whoa.
You had 400 people packed into a place?
You damn right.
That's my job, man.
And it's mostly college kids.
My sister goes to Temple, so I got the hookup over there.
And hookups are good.
But, just to be clear, when you say your sister, do you mean your sister or your friend...
- Dude.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I mean my sister.
- Oh.
Okay.
Cool.
I was just...
Because he could mean his friend or his...
Stop talking.
So we're packed into this little place on Walnut.
We're halfway through the night, everything's goin' all right.
All of a sudden, I notice this dude eyeballin' me from across the bar.
- Shit.
- I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me.
- He's giving you crazy eyes.
- The insane, crazy eyes.
- Right?
- I know that.
So I walk over...
He's this big, cut Mexican dude... and I look at him and say, "Yo, ese... unless you want to get yo' ass torn apart... you'd better get that look off your face."
- No!
- You just walked right up to him and said that?
I had to, man.
You gotta make the first move.
- Always make the first move.
You know what I'm sayin'?
- L-I know.
- So what happened?
- Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down.
We're, like, eyeball to eyeball.
His grill is right up in mine.
It feels like an eternity.
Finally... he just opens up his mouth and says...
"I guess you gon' have to tear my ass apart, homes."
Oh, man.
So what'd you do?
Took him to the back alley... and I tore his ass apart!
Oh, my God!
That's insane!
Okay, I would like to do things like that.
I love that guy.
"I took him to the back alley"?
- Who does shit like that?
It's like a movie.
- There's something off about him.
- Oh, bro, that's racist.
- No, asshole, that's not what I meant.
- I'll go get the coffee.
What do you guys want?
- Dude, sit down.
Okay?
Wait till the waitress comes out here, and then you can stare at her.
- I wasn't gonna stare at her.
I was just gonna...
- He wasn't gonna stare at her.
- You're totally obsessed with that chick.
- No, I'm not.
I like her.
I have a little bit of a crush, yes.
But obsessed?
That's a bit of a harsh word.
- It's never gonna happen.
- Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.
- Why?
For what?
- You heard him.
When he's promoting', everybody named Mama's looking to get in.
That's true.
They do have "niggers hanging from rafters."
- Wow.
Nice.
- No, that's not what I was saying.
- Coffee?
- Yeah.
- Hitler?
- No, I'm not...
I'm not Adolf Hitler.
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.
Okay.
Well, that's just great.
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it?
Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at 200 people.
- Yeah, that's true.
- It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.
All right, let's do it.
- Sure about this?
- It's 2005, Charlie.
Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have no friends outside of your own race?
- No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid!
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not...
This is a college campus.
This is a great place to meet people of different cultures, diversify...
You're just trying to make black...
Mm-hmm.
You're trying to make black friends.
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.
Don't do this right now.
Okay.
See?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
- This is perfect.
- Huh.
Yeah.
- I'm gonna break the ice.
- Go for it.
'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.
'Bout to bust that shit up, boy!
Absolutely.
- Okay, that didn't go exactly the way...
- No.
- No.
It was really awkward.
- Really awkward.
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah!
- Hey, what's your name?
- Oh.
It's, uh, Charlie.
Do you play bones, Charlie?
I dabble.
Do you want to play?
I could get you a game.
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so...
- I bet you're really good.
- Well, it's been a long time, you know.
- Oh, come on.
- All right.
One game.
Domino, bitch!
This is bullshit.
Absolute bullshit.
- Why do these people like you more than they like me?
- Maybe it's comments like that.
I meant those people in there, not all black people.
What am I supposed to say?
You should say something different.
Figure something else out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Um, I'm Janell.
- Oh, hi.
- Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.
- Thanks.
You know.
I wanted to give you this.
- Oh.
Okay.
- You know?
- Give me a call sometime.
All right?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Well, you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing, dude?
- What?
That girl's gorgeous.
She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're not racist.
She probably has friends for me.
Well, if anything, I think we should be focused on black men, first of all.
What?
We don't really need...
We need black guys, so...
- Black guys?
What are you talking about?
- You know.
Is this about that waitress at the coffee shop, dude?
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
- No, I'm not.
- Let me see your wallet.
- Why?
- Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?
- No.
Give it to me.
Give it...
Oh, my God!
Stop making a scene!
Just give me the wallet!
Give me the wallet!
I can't get the goddamn...
It's okay!
It's okay, everybody!
- You're making a scene.
- You're making a scene!
I got it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hold on a second.
- Ha!
Ha-ha!
Ha!
- Give it to me!
He had it!
Okay!
You found it!
- I'm gonna tear it up!
- No, don't!
Just give me it.
I'll call the black girl.
Okay?
Okay, buddy.
We're cool.
We're cool.
We're good.
Thanks, guys.
See ya.
I had the craziest dream last night that I was in Cleveland, Ohio... which is really weird, because I've never even been to Ohio.
This guy was wearing a bunny suit, and he was coming out...
You know what, Dee?
I don't wanna hear about your dreams.
Okay?
I hate listening to people's dreams.
It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's having sex, I just...
I don't care.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.
- 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
- I'm sorry.
I am.
- Hey!
What's goin' on, guys?
- Terrell.
- How are you?
- Hey!
What's up?
What's up?
How you doin'?
Dennis!
What's goin' on?
- All right, man.
- How's it goin', man?
Good, man.
Listen, um, you mind stepping outside with me for a second, man?
- Yeah, I'll come outside.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Well, come on.
I'm gonna put these out on the tables.
Rule number one:
Always keep a line.
Oh, my God!
That is a lot of people!
Wow!
- This is crazy!
- I know!
I told you!
Terrell's the best!
I'm gonna have to start bartending full-time.
L-Look at this!
- Why are you making more money than me?
- I don't know!
- Hey, this is crazy!
- I know.
Terrell packed 'em in.
Look at this.
- This is crazy!
- Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.
- Lot of dudes.
- Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.
Lot of dudes.
What can I get you boys?
- Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
- What cute one?
Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett by the jukebox?
- Oh, yeah!
- Let's go say hey.
- Yo, Brettie boy!
- Hey, cuz!
- Hey!
How you doin'?
- What's up, Brett?
Can you believe this crowd?
- Oh, it's something else!
- Yeah!
Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested.
I actually got a couple of services I'd like to request.
Whoa!
Uh, what are you doin, man?
I'm not...
- You have the most beautiful eyes.
- Okay, man, but I'm...
Really?
So blue.
Really more of a blue-green, actually, but...
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Yeah, thanks.
- You've come a long way.
- What do you mean?
You guys are running the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
No!
What in the hell is your problem?
How could you not tell me you were gay?
I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.
I've been coming on to you for weeks now.
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.

You don't care about the money.
You just like the attention.

You know exactly what I mean, pretty boy.
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, hoss.
- I just get along really well with those guys.
- They're vibing.
No, you're leading them on.
You're not gay, you're just really vain.
Okay, time out.
Here's what we should do.
Let's take a vote.
- Fine.
- Okay.
All those in favor of Paddy's Pub remaining a gay bar, say "aye."
- Aye.
- Aye.
Opposed?
- K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why?
- Because you're the bartender.
You're not one of the owners.
- No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.
- No, she doesn't!
- Of course I get a vote!
All owners opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed... say "nay."
Nay.
- Two against one!
Oh, well.
- Ohh!
Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
- Hey-hey!
What's going on?
- Hey!
- Look at you!
You look good!
- Oh, thank you.
That's so sweet.
- So, where we going?
- Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.
- Oh, I want one so bad.
- All righty!
Oh, a coffee shop.
I thought you meant, like, a drink at a bar.
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, why don't you have a seat here.
I'll go get the coffee.
What would you like?
- I don't really drink coffee.
Let me see.
- Totally.
What do you want, Charlie?
"What do you want, Charlie?"
I'd like you to take a look at the lovely young African-American woman... sitting at the table over there.
Okay.
That woman is my friend.
Wow.
Good for you.
So, the other day when you heard me saying something... about certain people hanging from said rafters...
I was quoting a friend of mine who also happens...
What are you trying to say?
Spit it out.
Well, now that you know that I'm not racist, you and I could maybe go on...
Dude, N-O.
- How many times do I have to say it to you?
- One time is fine.
- Apparently one time is not fine.
- One time per time I ask you.
Hey, what's going on up here?
Oh, not too much.
Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist.
Then he asked me out on a date.
Charlie, is this true?
Would that upset you if it was something that was true?
- You need to see a doctor.
This thing looks really bad.
- I did!
- What'd he say?
- He said that Janell punched me in my eye!
All right, well, you need to keep that i...
- Wait.
Her name's Janell?
- Yeah.
Janell Jenkins.
She's got a hell of a right hand.
She also said if she ever saw me again, she was going to slit my throat.
Are you two seeing this?
Boys are out tonight, huh?
This is unbelievable.
What is going on here?
You got black women crawling all over you... and this Mary here is the belle of the ball.
- Why do these people like you guys so much?
- It's not that they like us.
It's that they don't like you.
You know why?
Uh, because you're an asshole!
Is that true?
Yeah, kind of.
Can I talk to you in back for a second?
- What's up?
- You know that girl Janell?
I know her.
- Okay.
So what?
- So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.
Great.
How?
We gotta start with Dennis.
Can you get him so drunk tonight?
On tequila.
But a lot of it.
Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.
- Yeah, sure.
No problem.
- All right.
- Where are you going?
- I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.
But seriously...
blackout drunk.
All right.
Okay.
So you did the lime first, and then the shot, right?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Dude.
- You take the salt...
- Take the salt.
And then you take the shot.
Okay.
- And then you suck on the lime.
Okay?
- Okay.
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.
- You lick it.
- Salt.
Lick it.
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah?
Oh, that's great.
All right, so, I'm gonna do the shot first...
No, no, no, no...
Oh...
Oh, please, please, dude.
You're not listening to me.
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not...
The salt first.
Then the lime.
Oh, God.
Hello.
Mmm.
Nice.
Beautiful.
Hello, lover.
Whoa!
What the hell!
What is going on here?
Relax, stud.
You got nothing to be ashamed about.
What the f...
What does that mean?
- Did we have...
- No.
No.
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.
How's that ass feelin'?
I'm really glad you decided to embrace this.
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.
- I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah!
I don't want to own a gay bar anymore.
What, dude?
Oh, no.
What happened?
Just, uh...
I was doing some thinking and, you know...
We had our little experiment.
It was great.
But we should go back to normal.
Oh.
You had an experiment, and you want to go back to the way it was before the experiment.
- Interesting.
- The bar.
We had our experiment with the bar, and it was great.
Let's go back to normal.
You're done experimenting?
Or are you gonna experiment some more?
- What is this experimenting?
- Hey, Dennis!
What's up?
Listen, I got you some new CDs.
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox was a little bit stale.
Also, we gotta get rid of these shamrocks.
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks like Irish crap.
- Can we talk for a second in private?
- Yeah.
No problem.
So, listen, Terrell, it's not really working out.
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.
No, we were happy.
But then Dennis had an experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.
Yeah, we had that experiment...
Why do you keep saying it like that?
You guys are being ridiculous.
Yeah, we're being ridiculous!
We're making a lot of money!
- Yes!
Thank you!
- Look, everybody!
Sweet Dee's here!
- Hey, everybody!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
What are you doing here?
- Charlie?
- What is going on here?
You guys know each other?
Yeah!
That's the crazy bitch that punched me in my eye!
Charlie!
That's my sister.
Now, just to clarify, when you say "sister," you mean...
I mean my sister.
Yes!
Okay!
This is great!
Because earlier you were implying that I was racist... because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related.
And then it turns out that you people actually are!
No, that's not what I meant.
Hold on a second.
I meant that you two actually are.
Mac?
Stop talkin'.
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12, hundred and 13... $114!
- On a Saturday night!
- We're back to normal.
We are back to normal.
Mmm.
Dee, I gotta know.
What, exactly, did you tell those guys from your acting class to do to Dennis?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.
- What?
- Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.
Then why was he so freaked out?
How's that ass feelin'?

(beer can pops open) DEE:
Oh, yeah.
These are going down real smooth now.
MAC:
Dee, slow down.
You're on pace to drink 130 beers.
FRANK:
Don't ruin this for me, Deandra.
This could be the last chance I got to do something great in my life.
You jerks are just all mad 'cause I'm gonna be the one to shatter Boss Hogg's drinking record.
DENNIS:
Dee, Boss Hogg was a big, fat redneck from The Dukes of Hazzard.
Wade Boggs is a Hall of Fame third baseman.
CHARLIE:
Yeah, it's Wade
Boggs's drinking record, okay?
The man's a legend.
He drank 50 beers on a cross-country flight and then absolutely destroyed the Seattle Mariners the next day, okay?
That's why we're doing this, to honor his memory, okay?
May he rest in peace.
First off, Wade Boggs is very much alive.
Secondly, the number of beers is actually highly disputed.
Some say 50, some teammates said 60, some said as many as 70 beers.
Which, to be honest, is an absolutely insane amount of beer.
Nobody can drink that much.
FRANK:
Not with an attitude like that.
Perhaps we're taking this a little bit too seriously?
Absolutely we're not, okay?
The man is a legend.
That's why we're doing this, all right?
To honor his memory.
Rest in peace, Wade.
Again, he is still alive.
Always sticking me with the nerds.
(call button chimes)
Yes, ma'am?
Uh, actually, I can, uh, handle this one.
We'll be sharing the in-flight call system today.
Excuse me?
Oh, sorry, let me explain.
We're doing a Wade Boggs-type thing, and that makes me sort of the Commissioner Bud Selig of the group.
Oh, you're the commissioner now?
Well, somebody's gotta keep the game fair and everybody invested, okay, Dee?
He didn't win the chugging contest.
Two more beers, please.
Actually, ma'am, we're about to take off, so we're gonna need you to stow your tray table.
Yay.
Let me take that and throw it out for you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, but just give me a second.
Okay?
Just give me a second?
There you go.
Great.
(Dee belches)
Hold on.
Hold on.
Ugh!
Ouch!
It's... really cold.
Man, Dee... (Dee belches) Oh, God.
You really have to slow down a little bit.
("Take Me Out to the Ball Game" plays)
Can I get you something to drink?
Yeah, I'll just get a beer, please.
(whispering):
Hey, Frank.
I'm a little concerned about this frat boy over here.
There's only so many beers on the flight.
FRANK:
I'll take care of him.
For you, sir?
Excuse me, miss?
Mm-hmm.
Um, actually, yeah... how many beers are we allowed to order at once?
I'm not sure.
No one has ever asked that before.
Okay, great, so there's no rule on that.
Uh, why don't you give me six, then, please?
How about you make it an even dozen?
How about I start you with two apiece and then we just take it from there?
Sure, if you want to be lugging beers back and forth the entire flight.
I guess that's, uh, up to you.
I'll be taking care of everybody on the Boggs account.
Oh, and by the way, do you sell condoms?
No, I'm afraid we don't.
Aw...
Yeah.
I'll have to figure something else out.
Got it.
Thank you so much.
Hey...
Frank.
Mmm?
What's with the condom thing?
You think the Boggs record is the only one I'm going for?
I'm gonna become the first-ever member of the Air Sex Society.
Okay.
What is that?
That means I'm gonna be plowing somebody in the bathroom before this plane lands.
Right, but do you think you just made that up?
Because that's already a thing.
It's called the Mile High Club.
People have been doing it since planes have been around.
That name sucks.
I'll tell you what, though.
I will make you a bet that I plow somebody on this fight, somewhere other than the bathroom, before we hit the Great Lakes.
I'll take that bet.
Yeah?
Whoa, whoa.
Did I hear you guys talking about a bet?
There's no betting, okay?
That compromises the integrity of the game.
It's got nothing to do with the Wade Boggs thing.
It doesn't matter, okay, guys?
That's a rule, and as commissioner, you have to obey me.
Right, Commissioner.
Go get me another beer.
Okay, I will, but... not because you told me to, but because I'm commissioner and that's my job.

No, that's cool, I'm still doing the Boggs thing, but you know what?
A stiff cocktail would go good with my chicken, so...
Why are you filling up with chicken?
Do you know anything about Wade Boggs?
The man ate a chicken before every game, all right?
That's why they called him the Chicken Man.
Man batted .328

I'm sure he ate some rum and
Cokes, too, all right?

You just said "ate rum and Cokes."

You know, Commissioner, you just... you kind of just lost the chugging contest...
Go.

Hey!
You know, I actually went to school at the same college, your alma mater, in 1966.

Oh, that's nice of you.
Yeah, yeah, good, yeah.

Don't worry about it.
I laced it with sleeping pills.
He's gonna be out like a light in two minutes.
That is some diabolical shit, dude.
Ow...!
(Dennis laughs) So what's going on with the sex moves?
I've been laying chum up and down this plane.
Yeah, I-I know.
I've noticed.
Yeah, I've got my prey picked out.
I'm just waiting for the right moment to pounce.
What are you talking about?
You haven't moved an inch.
You're just drinking.
Oh, is that what you think?
Mm-hmm.
Frank, of the 206 passengers on this flight, 98 of them are women, but only one of them is a suitable candidate:
44G.
Notice how she glances forlornly at the empty seat next to her.
It was meant for someone special.
And the tan line on her ring finger suggests the wound is still fresh, leaving her vulnerable.
Furthermore, when we hit turbulence earlier, she giggled, telling me she's a bit of a thrill seeker.
You think she offed the guy and went on the run?
Pretty tough to lay low in a dress like that.
Granted, it's not a particularly remarkable garment.
It's from the J.Crew Spring 2012 collection.
Although, it is a bit much for an airplane.
Furthermore, if she were standing, you'd notice she's got no panty line, giving me about five extra seconds to enter her swiftly before she realizes I am not the answer to her problems.
(laughs) I'll tell you my tastes lie a little bit more in 39F.
No.
No, thank you, Frank.
No, her blouse is covered in cigarette burns.
And I imagine underneath that blouse, you'll find copious amounts of road rash, probably sustained in some sort of off-roading accident, which would also explain her limp.
Although, something tells me the two are unrelated.
Either way, she's North Dakota trash through and through and far beneath a gentleman such as myself.
Uh, miss?
Six more beers.
(groans) Hey-oh!
Ah, there we go.
Yeah.
Hey, listen, Charlie?
Yeah.
I need you to start a
McGwire/Sosa-like rivalry with Dee.
Look, I think you're getting, like, too worked up about this thing.
Can we just drink the beer and hang out, you know?
Well, here-here's the thing.
The game seems to be getting a little bit off the rails.
Frank and Dennis are super distracted and Dee is kind of just running away with it.
Boggsy didn't drink six gallons of beer because he was obsessed with, like, breaking some record.
You know what I mean?
He did it 'cause he was just, like, thirsty, you know?
And looking to pass the time.
Yeah, but I can sell a rivalry, all right?
What I can't sell is... 27 beers.
What-what am I gonna do with 27 beers?
Who-who cares about 27 beers?
We're not selling anything.
Like, I think you're taking the commissioner thing way...
Look, you lost the chugging contest, man.
It's not a big deal.
Why did you make me Bud Selig if you didn't...?
Nobody did.
You just started saying that.
Look, I got empties for you.
Just take those and don't, like, put so much pressure on yourself over...
Attention, passengers.
This is your captain, Boss Hogg, speaking.

Okay, luckily I came prepared.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Charlie, we're not on a wide-body DC-10 for nothing.
Right.
We bought tickets.
Well, yes, but we chose a wide-body DC-10 on purpose.
That's what I was...
To get up in the sky.
Let me walk you through it.
I got a hundred extra beers in a checked bag, okay?
Now, according to movies like
Executive Decision and Passenger 57, there is a secret hatch on every plane that allows me to travel freely throughout the aircraft.
Well, everybody knows that.
Yeah, so I just got to find my right time to get down there.
I think you can probably go, like, anytime, yeah.
Or just do it... just right now, right?

Yeah.
But it-it's all good, Frank.
You know, hey, turns out Boggs, he didn't hit it out of the park every single time at bat.

He just tried to get the ball in play and hope that he could squeak it through the hole.
And I just, uh, squeaked it through multiple holes if you know what I'm saying.

We don't want any trouble.
- What?
Guys, this is Terrell... from my acting class.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, man.
How's it goin'?
- It's going good.
How you doin'?
- Good, man.
- We're just chillin', dude.
- Great.
- Just closing up shop.
- Yeah.
Whoa.
Guess you guys don't have too many brothers walking through here.
- Oh, no, no.
- We got plenty of brothers.
Yeah...
A-African-Americans.
Okay.
Yeah, we get it.
You might know some of them.
Yeah.
We're probably related.
No.
I don't think he was implying that you guys are all related.
That's ridiculous.
Sweet Dee came in here a second ago and started talking about acting class.
- We weren't expecting you...
- We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.
Right.
Thanks, guys.
When I'm promoting', everybody and their mama gonna be there.
There's gonna be brothers, white boys, Latinos, whatever.
You got niggas hanging from the rafters.
So we got 400-plus packed into this tiny little place...
Whoa.
You had 400 people packed into a place?
You damn right.
That's my job, man.
And it's mostly college kids.
My sister goes to Temple, so I got the hookup over there.
And hookups are good.
But, just to be clear, when you say your sister, do you mean your sister or your friend...
- Dude.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I mean my sister.
- Oh.
Okay.
Cool.
I was just...
Because he could mean his friend or his...
Stop talking.
So we're packed into this little place on Walnut.
We're halfway through the night, everything's goin' all right.
All of a sudden, I notice this dude eyeballin' me from across the bar.
- Shit.
- I don't know if this dude wants to freak me or fight me.
- He's giving you crazy eyes.
- The insane, crazy eyes.
- Right?
- I know that.
So I walk over...
He's this big, cut Mexican dude... and I look at him and say, "Yo, ese... unless you want to get yo' ass torn apart... you'd better get that look off your face."
- No!
- You just walked right up to him and said that?
I had to, man.
You gotta make the first move.
- Always make the first move.
You know what I'm sayin'?
- L-I know.
- So what happened?
- Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down.
We're, like, eyeball to eyeball.
His grill is right up in mine.
It feels like an eternity.
Finally... he just opens up his mouth and says...
"I guess you gon' have to tear my ass apart, homes."
Oh, man.
So what'd you do?
Took him to the back alley... and I tore his ass apart!
Oh, my God!
That's insane!
Okay, I would like to do things like that.
I love that guy.
"I took him to the back alley"?
- Who does shit like that?
It's like a movie.
- There's something off about him.
- Oh, bro, that's racist.
- No, asshole, that's not what I meant.
- I'll go get the coffee.
What do you guys want?
- Dude, sit down.
Okay?
Wait till the waitress comes out here, and then you can stare at her.
- I wasn't gonna stare at her.
I was just gonna...
- He wasn't gonna stare at her.
- You're totally obsessed with that chick.
- No, I'm not.
I like her.
I have a little bit of a crush, yes.
But obsessed?
That's a bit of a harsh word.
- It's never gonna happen.
- Honestly, I think we should think about hiring Terrell.
- Why?
For what?
- You heard him.
When he's promoting', everybody named Mama's looking to get in.
That's true.
They do have "niggers hanging from rafters."
- Wow.
Nice.
- No, that's not what I was saying.
- Coffee?
- Yeah.
- Hitler?
- No, I'm not...
I'm not Adolf Hitler.
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.
Okay.
Well, that's just great.
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it?
Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at 200 people.
- Yeah, that's true.
- It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.
All right, let's do it.
- Sure about this?
- It's 2005, Charlie.
Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have no friends outside of your own race?
- No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid!
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not...
This is a college campus.
This is a great place to meet people of different cultures, diversify...
You're just trying to make black...
Mm-hmm.
You're trying to make black friends.
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.
Don't do this right now.
Okay.
See?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
- This is perfect.
- Huh.
Yeah.
- I'm gonna break the ice.
- Go for it.
'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.
'Bout to bust that shit up, boy!
Absolutely.
- Okay, that didn't go exactly the way...
- No.
- No.
It was really awkward.
- Really awkward.
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah!
- Hey, what's your name?
- Oh.
It's, uh, Charlie.
Do you play bones, Charlie?
I dabble.
Do you want to play?
I could get you a game.
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so...
- I bet you're really good.
- Well, it's been a long time, you know.
- Oh, come on.
- All right.
One game.
Domino, bitch!
This is bullshit.
Absolute bullshit.
- Why do these people like you more than they like me?
- Maybe it's comments like that.
I meant those people in there, not all black people.
What am I supposed to say?
You should say something different.
Figure something else out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Um, I'm Janell.
- Oh, hi.
- Uh, you got some moves out there, Charlie.
- Thanks.
You know.
I wanted to give you this.
- Oh.
Okay.
- You know?
- Give me a call sometime.
All right?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Well, you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing, dude?
- What?
That girl's gorgeous.
She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're not racist.
She probably has friends for me.
Well, if anything, I think we should be focused on black men, first of all.
What?
We don't really need...
We need black guys, so...
- Black guys?
What are you talking about?
- You know.
Is this about that waitress at the coffee shop, dude?
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
- No, I'm not.
- Let me see your wallet.
- Why?
- Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?
- No.
Give it to me.
Give it...
Oh, my God!
Stop making a scene!
Just give me the wallet!
Give me the wallet!
I can't get the goddamn...
It's okay!
It's okay, everybody!
- You're making a scene.
- You're making a scene!
I got it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hold on a second.
- Ha!
Ha-ha!
Ha!
- Give it to me!
He had it!
Okay!
You found it!
- I'm gonna tear it up!
- No, don't!
Just give me it.
I'll call the black girl.
Okay?
Okay, buddy.
We're cool.
We're cool.
We're good.
Thanks, guys.
See ya.
I had the craziest dream last night that I was in Cleveland, Ohio... which is really weird, because I've never even been to Ohio.
This guy was wearing a bunny suit, and he was coming out...
You know what, Dee?
I don't wanna hear about your dreams.
Okay?
I hate listening to people's dreams.
It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's having sex, I just...
I don't care.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.
- 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
- I'm sorry.
I am.
- Hey!
What's goin' on, guys?
- Terrell.
- How are you?
- Hey!
What's up?
What's up?
How you doin'?
Dennis!
What's goin' on?
- All right, man.
- How's it goin', man?
Good, man.
Listen, um, you mind stepping outside with me for a second, man?
- Yeah, I'll come outside.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Well, come on.
I'm gonna put these out on the tables.
Rule number one:
Always keep a line.
Oh, my God!
That is a lot of people!
Wow!
- This is crazy!
- I know!
I told you!
Terrell's the best!
I'm gonna have to start bartending full-time.
L-Look at this!
- Why are you making more money than me?
- I don't know!
- Hey, this is crazy!
- I know.
Terrell packed 'em in.
Look at this.
- This is crazy!
- Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.
- Lot of dudes.
- Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.
Lot of dudes.
What can I get you boys?
- Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
- What cute one?
Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett by the jukebox?
- Oh, yeah!
- Let's go say hey.
- Yo, Brettie boy!
- Hey, cuz!
- Hey!
How you doin'?
- What's up, Brett?
Can you believe this crowd?
- Oh, it's something else!
- Yeah!
Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested.
I actually got a couple of services I'd like to request.
Whoa!
Uh, what are you doin, man?
I'm not...
- You have the most beautiful eyes.
- Okay, man, but I'm...
Really?
So blue.
Really more of a blue-green, actually, but...
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Yeah, thanks.
- You've come a long way.
- What do you mean?
You guys are running the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
No!
What in the hell is your problem?
How could you not tell me you were gay?
I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.
I've been coming on to you for weeks now.
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.
- I am not into gay dudes!
- Apparently you are.
- Okay, well, you know what?
The guys hired you to promote their bar, and you turned it into a gay bar.
They are not happy.
- So much money!
- Whoo!
Oh!
So much money!
We made more money in one night...
Th-Than in the entire time that we've owned this place!
We have to embrace the situation.
We should totally embrace the situation!
- We're a gay bar from now on.
- Absolutely, man!
No goddamn way.
Have you guys seen this?
"Looking for that new hot spot to spot that stud?
Well, Paddy's Irish Pub has plugged that hole."
- That's a nice notice.
- No, it's not nice.
I don't want to be plugging anybody's holes.
- I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.
- Of course you are.
I made $300 last night.
How much did you make?
First of all, that's rude.
And that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
It has everything to do with it.
I don't think we have much of a choice.
We need to do this.
If you guys remember, one of the major reasons we got this bar was to get laid.
Maybe you did it to get laid.
I got a little something I like to call business ethics.
Business ethics?
The only reason you don't care is you have black girls hanging all over you.
Okay, chill out.
You're gonna screw it up.
Screw it up?
I happen to have a date with a nice young lady today.
- Ouch.
- It's a purely fiscal decision.
Oh, bullshit.
You don't care about the money.
You just like the attention.
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- "Everybody look at me!"
You know exactly what I mean, pretty boy.
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, hoss.
- I just get along really well with those guys.
- They're vibing.
No, you're leading them on.
You're not gay, you're just really vain.
Okay, time out.
Here's what we should do.
Let's take a vote.
- Fine.
- Okay.
All those in favor of Paddy's Pub remaining a gay bar, say "aye."
- Aye.
- Aye.
Opposed?
- K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why?
- Because you're the bartender.
You're not one of the owners.
- No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.
- No, she doesn't!
- Of course I get a vote!
All owners opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed... say "nay."
Nay.
- Two against one!
Oh, well.
- Ohh!
Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
- Hey-hey!
What's going on?
- Hey!
- Look at you!
You look good!
- Oh, thank you.
That's so sweet.
- So, where we going?
- Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.
- Oh, I want one so bad.
- All righty!
Oh, a coffee shop.
I thought you meant, like, a drink at a bar.
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, why don't you have a seat here.
I'll go get the coffee.
What would you like?
- I don't really drink coffee.
Let me see.
- Totally.
What do you want, Charlie?
"What do you want, Charlie?"
I'd like you to take a look at the lovely young African-American woman... sitting at the table over there.
Okay.
That woman is my friend.
Wow.
Good for you.
So, the other day when you heard me saying something... about certain people hanging from said rafters...
I was quoting a friend of mine who also happens...
What are you trying to say?
Spit it out.
Well, now that you know that I'm not racist, you and I could maybe go on...
Dude, N-O.
- How many times do I have to say it to you?
- One time is fine.
- Apparently one time is not fine.
- One time per time I ask you.
Hey, what's going on up here?
Oh, not too much.
Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist.
Then he asked me out on a date.
Charlie, is this true?
Would that upset you if it was something that was true?
- You need to see a doctor.
This thing looks really bad.
- I did!
- What'd he say?
- He said thatJanell punched me in my eye!
All right, well, you need to keep that i...
- Wait.
Her name's Janell?
- Yeah.
JanellJenkins.
She's got a hell of a right hand.
She also said if she ever saw me again, she was going to slit my throat.
Are you two seeing this?
Boys are out tonight, huh?
This is unbelievable.
What is going on here?
You got black women crawling all over you... and this Mary here is the belle of the ball.
- Why do these people like you guys so much?
- It's not that they like us.
It's that they don't like you.
You know why?
Uh, because you're an asshole!
Is that true?
Yeah, kind of.
Can I talk to you in back for a second?
- What's up?
- You know that girlJanell?
I know her.
- Okay.
So what?
- So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.
Great.
How?
We gotta start with Dennis.
Can you get him so drunk tonight?
On tequila.
But a lot of it.
Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.
- Yeah, sure.
No problem.
- All right.
- Where are you going?
- I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.
But seriously...
blackout drunk.
All right.
Okay.
So you did the lime first, and then the shot, right?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Dude.
- You take the salt...
- Take the salt.
And then you take the shot.
Okay.
- And then you suck on the lime.
Okay?
- Okay.
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.
- You lick it.
- Salt.
Lick it.
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah?
Oh, that's great.
All right, so, I'm gonna do the shot first...
No, no, no, no...
Oh...
Oh, please, please, dude.
You're not listening to me.
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not...
The salt first.
Then the lime.
Oh, God.
Hello.
Mmm.
Nice.
Beautiful.
Hello, lover.
Whoa!
What the hell!
What is going on here?
Relax, stud.
You got nothing to be ashamed about.
What the f...
What does that mean?
- Did we have...
- No.
No.
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.
How's that ass feelin'?
I'm really glad you decided to embrace this.
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.
- I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah!
I don't want to own a gay bar anymore.
What, dude?
Oh, no.
What happened?
Just, uh...
I was doing some thinking and, you know...
We had our little experiment.
It was great.
But we should go back to normal.
Oh.
You had an experiment, and you want to go back to the way it was before the experiment.
- Interesting.
- The bar.
We had our experiment with the bar, and it was great.
Let's go back to normal.
You're done experimenting?
Or are you gonna experiment some more?
- What is this experimenting?
- Hey, Dennis!
What's up?
Listen, I got you some new CDs.
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox was a little bit stale.
Also, we gotta get rid of these shamrocks.
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks like Irish crap.
- Can we talk for a second in private?
- Yeah.
No problem.
So, listen, Terrell, it's not really working out.
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.
No, we were happy.
But then Dennis had an experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.
Yeah, we had that experiment...
Why do you keep saying it like that?
You guys are being ridiculous.
Yeah, we're being ridiculous!
We're making a lot of money!
- Yes!
Thank you!
- Look, everybody!
Sweet Dee's here!
- Hey, everybody!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
What are you doing here?
- Charlie?
- What is going on here?
You guys know each other?
Yeah!
That's the crazy bitch that punched me in my eye!
Charlie!
That's my sister.
Now, just to clarify, when you say "sister," you mean...
I mean my sister.
Yes!
Okay!
This is great!
Because earlier you were implying that I was racist... because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related.
And then it turns out that you people actually are!
No, that's not what I meant.
Hold on a second.
I meant that you two actually are.
Mac?
Stop talkin'.
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12, hundred and 13... $114!
- On a Saturday night!
- We're back to normal.
We are back to normal.
Mmm.
Dee, I gotta know.
What, exactly, did you tell those guys from your acting class to do to Dennis?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.
- What?
- Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.
Then why was he so freaked out?
How's that ass feelin'?
Another big night, fellas... $ 164.87.
- That's not a lot of money.
- No, it isn't.
- And our mortgage is due in two weeks.
- We paid that a week ago.
A week ago was three weeks late, Mac.
Hey, guys.
I met this guy in acting class.
He's really cool, and he wants to see where I work.
So could you guys try to not be weird?
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I love you guys, but sometimes you're not that cool.
- We're cool!
- Not cool?
- Try to be cool.
- Sometimes you're not too cool.
- Charlie...
- Always cool, man.
- Oh, hey, man, we're closed.
- Yeah, I know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We don't want any trouble.
- What?
Guys, this is Terrell... from my acting class.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hey, man.
How's it goin'?
- It's going good.
How you doin'?
- Good, man.
- We're just chillin', dude.
- Great.
- Just closing up shop.
- Yeah.
Whoa.
Guess you guys don't have too many brothers walking through here.
- Oh, no, no.
- We got plenty of brothers.
Yeah...
A-African-Americans.
Okay.
Yeah, we get it.
You might know some of them.
Yeah.
We're probably related.
No.
I don't think he was implying that you guys are all related.
That's ridiculous.
Sweet Dee came in here a second ago and started talking about acting class.
- We weren't expecting you...
- We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.
Right.
Thanks, guys.
When I'm promoting', everybody and their mama gonna be there.
There's gonna be brothers, white boys, Latinos, whatever.
You got niggas hanging from the rafters.
So we got 400-plus packed into this tiny little place...
Whoa.
You had 400 people packed into a place?
You damn right.

And it's mostly college kids.
My sister goes to Temple, so I got the hookup over there.
And hookups are good.
But, just to be clear, when you say your sister, do you mean your sister or your friend...
- Dude.
- Oh, Jesus.
- I mean my sister.
- Oh.
Okay.
Cool.
I was just...
Because he could mean his friend or his...
Stop talking.
So we're packed into this little place on Walnut.
We're halfway through the night, everything's goin' all right.
All of a sudden, I notice this dude eyeballin' me from across the bar.

Took him to the back alley... and I tore his ass apart!
Oh, my God!
That's insane!
Okay, I would like to do things like that.
I love that guy.
"I took him to the back alley"?
- Who does shit like that?
It's like a movie.

- Yeah.
- Hitler?
- No, I'm not...
I'm not Adolf Hitler.
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.
Okay.
Well, that's just great.
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it?
Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises, we're looking at 200 people.

Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have no friends outside of your own race?
- No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid!
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not...
This is a college campus.
This is a great place to meet people of different cultures, diversify...
You're just trying to make black...
Mm-hmm.
You're trying to make black friends.
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell with a couple of black friends.
Don't do this right now.
Okay.
See?
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
- This is perfect.
- Huh.
Yeah.
- I'm gonna break the ice.
- Go for it.
'Bout to bust that shit up, Reese.
'Bout to bust that shit up, boy!
Absolutely.
- Okay, that didn't go exactly the way...
- No.
- No.
It was really awkward.
- Really awkward.
- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah!
- Hey, what's your name?
- Oh.
It's, uh, Charlie.
Do you play bones, Charlie?
I dabble.
Do you want to play?
I could get you a game.
Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so...

- Oh.
Okay.
- You know?
- Give me a call sometime.
All right?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Well, you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing, dude?
- What?
That girl's gorgeous.
She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're not racist.
She probably has friends for me.
Well, if anything, I think we should be focused on black men, first of all.
What?
We don't really need...
We need black guys, so...
- Black guys?
What are you talking about?
- You know.
Is this about that waitress at the coffee shop, dude?
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- Dude, you are obsessed with this chick.
- No, I'm not.
- Let me see your wallet.
- Why?
- Are you still carrying a picture of her in your wallet?
- No.
Give it to me.
Give it...
Oh, my God!
Stop making a scene!
Just give me the wallet!
Give me the wallet!
I can't get the goddamn...
It's okay!
It's okay, everybody!
- You're making a scene.
- You're making a scene!
I got it.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Hold on a second.
- Ha!
Ha-ha!
Ha!
- Give it to me!
He had it!
Okay!
You found it!
- I'm gonna tear it up!
- No, don't!
Just give me it.
I'll call the black girl.
Okay?
Okay, buddy.
We're cool.
We're cool.
We're good.
Thanks, guys.
See ya.
I had the craziest dream last night that I was in Cleveland, Ohio... which is really weird, because I've never even been to Ohio.
This guy was wearing a bunny suit, and he was coming out...
You know what, Dee?
I don't wanna hear about your dreams.
Okay?
I hate listening to people's dreams.
It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's having sex, I just...
I don't care.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.
- 'Cause your my brother and I love you.
- I'm sorry.
I am.
- Hey!
What's goin' on, guys?
- Terrell.
- How are you?
- Hey!
What's up?
What's up?
How you doin'?
Dennis!
What's goin' on?
- All right, man.
- How's it goin', man?
Good, man.
Listen, um, you mind stepping outside with me for a second, man?
- Yeah, I'll come outside.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Well, come on.
I'm gonna put these out on the tables.
Rule number one:
Always keep a line.
Oh, my God!
That is a lot of people!
Wow!
- This is crazy!
- I know!
I told you!
Terrell's the best!
I'm gonna have to start bartending full-time.
L-Look at this!
- Why are you making more money than me?
- I don't know!
- Hey, this is crazy!
- I know.
Terrell packed 'em in.
Look at this.
- This is crazy!
- Yeah, dude, we were just saying that.
- Lot of dudes.
- Yeah, there's a lot of dudes.
Lot of dudes.
What can I get you boys?
- Oh, uh, we wanted to wait for the cute one.
- What cute one?
Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett by the jukebox?
- Oh, yeah!
- Let's go say hey.
- Yo, Brettie boy!
- Hey, cuz!
- Hey!
How you doin'?
- What's up, Brett?
Can you believe this crowd?
- Oh, it's something else!
- Yeah!
Gentlemen, I understand my services have been requested.
I actually got a couple of services I'd like to request.
Whoa!
Uh, what are you doin, man?
I'm not...
- You have the most beautiful eyes.
- Okay, man, but I'm...
Really?
So blue.
Really more of a blue-green, actually, but...
- I'm really proud of you, man.
- Yeah, thanks.
- You've come a long way.
- What do you mean?
You guys are running the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
No!
What in the hell is your problem?
How could you not tell me you were gay?
I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.
I've been coming on to you for weeks now.
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.
- I am not into gay dudes!
- Apparently you are.
- Okay, well, you know what?
The guys hired you to promote their bar, and you turned it into a gay bar.
They are not happy.
- So much money!
- Whoo!
Oh!
So much money!
We made more money in one night...
Th-Than in the entire time that we've owned this place!
We have to embrace the situation.
We should totally embrace the situation!
- We're a gay bar from now on.
- Absolutely, man!
No goddamn way.
Have you guys seen this?
"Looking for that new hot spot to spot that stud?
Well, Paddy's Irish Pub has plugged that hole."
- That's a nice notice.
- No, it's not nice.
I don't want to be plugging anybody's holes.
- I'm gonna have to agree with Mac.
- Of course you are.
I made $300 last night.
How much did you make?
First of all, that's rude.
And that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
It has everything to do with it.
I don't think we have much of a choice.
We need to do this.
If you guys remember, one of the major reasons we got this bar was to get laid.
Maybe you did it to get laid.
I got a little something I like to call business ethics.
Business ethics?
The only reason you don't care is you have black girls hanging all over you.
Okay, chill out.
You're gonna screw it up.
Screw it up?
I happen to have a date with a nice young lady today.
- Ouch.
- It's a purely fiscal decision.
Oh, bullshit.
You don't care about the money.
You just like the attention.
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- "Everybody look at me!"
You know exactly what I mean, pretty boy.
- Hey, handsome.
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, hoss.
- I just get along really well with those guys.
- They're vibing.
No, you're leading them on.
You're not gay, you're just really vain.
Okay, time out.
Here's what we should do.
Let's take a vote.
- Fine.
- Okay.
All those in favor of Paddy's Pub remaining a gay bar, say "aye."
- Aye.
- Aye.
Opposed?
- K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why?
- Because you're the bartender.
You're not one of the owners.
- No, Sweet Dee gets a vote.
- No, she doesn't!
- Of course I get a vote!
All owners opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed, say "nay."
All people who own the bar who are opposed... say "nay."
Nay.
- Two against one!
Oh, well.
- Ohh!
Paddy's Irish Pub will henceforth remain the hottest gay bar in Philadelphia.
- Hey-hey!
What's going on?
- Hey!
- Look at you!
You look good!
- Oh, thank you.
That's so sweet.
- So, where we going?
- Well, I thought we'd go grab a drink.
- Oh, I want one so bad.
- All righty!
Oh, a coffee shop.
I thought you meant, like, a drink at a bar.
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, why don't you have a seat here.
I'll go get the coffee.
What would you like?
- I don't really drink coffee.
Let me see.
- Totally.
What do you want, Charlie?
"What do you want, Charlie?"
I'd like you to take a look at the lovely young African-American woman... sitting at the table over there.
Okay.
That woman is my friend.
Wow.
Good for you.
So, the other day when you heard me saying something... about certain people hanging from said rafters...
I was quoting a friend of mine who also happens...
What are you trying to say?
Spit it out.
Well, now that you know that I'm not racist, you and I could maybe go on...
Dude, N-O.
- How many times do I have to say it to you?
- One time is fine.
- Apparently one time is not fine.
- One time per time I ask you.
Hey, what's going on up here?
Oh, not too much.
Charlie's using you to prove that he's not racist.
Then he asked me out on a date.
Charlie, is this true?
Would that upset you if it was something that was true?
- You need to see a doctor.
This thing looks really bad.
- I did!
- What'd he say?
- He said thatJanell punched me in my eye!
All right, well, you need to keep that i...
- Wait.
Her name's Janell?
- Yeah.
JanellJenkins.
She's got a hell of a right hand.
She also said if she ever saw me again, she was going to slit my throat.
Are you two seeing this?
Boys are out tonight, huh?
This is unbelievable.
What is going on here?
You got black women crawling all over you... and this Mary here is the belle of the ball.
- Why do these people like you guys so much?
- It's not that they like us.
It's that they don't like you.
You know why?
Uh, because you're an asshole!
Is that true?
Yeah, kind of.
Can I talk to you in back for a second?
- What's up?
- You know that girlJanell?
I know her.
- Okay.
So what?
- So I think I know how we can solve this whole gay mess.
Great.
How?
We gotta start with Dennis.
Can you get him so drunk tonight?
On tequila.
But a lot of it.
Enough that maybe he might hurt himself.
- Yeah, sure.
No problem.
- All right.
- Where are you going?
- I gotta talk to a couple friends from my acting class.
But seriously...
blackout drunk.
All right.
Okay.
So you did the lime first, and then the shot, right?
No.
No, no, no, no.
Dude.
- You take the salt...
- Take the salt.
And then you take the shot.
Okay.
- And then you suck on the lime.
Okay?
- Okay.
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.
- You lick it.
- Salt.
Lick it.
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah?
Oh, that's great.
All right, so, I'm gonna do the shot first...
No, no, no, no...
Oh...
Oh, please, please, dude.
You're not listening to me.
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not...
The salt first.
Then the lime.
Oh, God.
Hello.
Mmm.
Nice.
Beautiful.
Hello, lover.
Whoa!
What the hell!
What is going on here?
Relax, stud.
You got nothing to be ashamed about.
What the f...
What does that mean?
- Did we have...
- No.
No.
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.
How's that ass feelin'?
I'm really glad you decided to embrace this.
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.
- I feel really good about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah!
I don't want to own a gay bar anymore.
What, dude?
Oh, no.
What happened?
Just, uh...
I was doing some thinking and, you know...
We had our little experiment.
It was great.
But we should go back to normal.
Oh.
You had an experiment, and you want to go back to the way it was before the experiment.
- Interesting.
- The bar.
We had our experiment with the bar, and it was great.
Let's go back to normal.
You're done experimenting?
Or are you gonna experiment some more?
- What is this experimenting?
- Hey, Dennis!
What's up?
Listen, I got you some new CDs.
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox was a little bit stale.
Also, we gotta get rid of these shamrocks.
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks like Irish crap.
- Can we talk for a second in private?
- Yeah.
No problem.
So, listen, Terrell, it's not really working out.
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.
No, we were happy.
But then Dennis had an experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.
Yeah, we had that experiment...
Why do you keep saying it like that?
You guys are being ridiculous.
Yeah, we're being ridiculous!
We're making a lot of money!
- Yes!
Thank you!
- Look, everybody!
Sweet Dee's here!
- Hey, everybody!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
What are you doing here?
- Charlie?
- What is going on here?
You guys know each other?
Yeah!
That's the crazy bitch that punched me in my eye!
Charlie!
That's my sister.
Now, just to clarify, when you say "sister," you mean...
I mean my sister.
Yes!
Okay!
This is great!
Because earlier you were implying that I was racist... because you thought that I was implying that all black people are related.
And then it turns out that you people actually are!
No, that's not what I meant.
Hold on a second.
I meant that you two actually are.
Mac?
Stop talkin'.
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12, hundred and 13... $114!
- On a Saturday night!
- We're back to normal.
We are back to normal.
Mmm.
Dee, I gotta know.
What, exactly, did you tell those guys from your acting class to do to Dennis?
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.
- What?
- Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.
Then why was he so freaked out?
How's that ass feelin'?
Noah's Arc
- Good morning, believers.
- Good morning.
It is a pleasure to see Another Sunday you are here the house of humility.
- Amen.
- Exactly ..
I ...
I'm so happy ... that the father woke me know what I'm saying?
The idea to wake up with two meters above ground
I am blessed.
How this will continue?
Wade, must be seated outside my door now.
- In front of your door?
- Wade moved today.
Why for the first time I hear this?
Noah, you know you should be consult on any large, life-changing decision connection before it is too!
Just because you were pressured in your first link does not make you an expert.
- But he moved!
- Do not move.
I'll just spend the night with me temporarily.
My space is inviolable.
But he hopes to remain permanently.
Hell, no!
It is too early for,
- And ...
- What?
Go ahead.
As much as I hate I must admit
I am not fully convinced that he not return to women.
... do not judge once again ...
The court is not you!
Do not judge!
This is weird!
For those who do not attend church.
I go every Saturday or Sunday.
I have my own church for years.
Church of trance, probably all gay.
My church does not judge who and what they are.
In contrast to this place.
It is filled with gay and transvestites.
Look, I know that there are many problems with the churches of Negroes but is a way I can stay connected with my childhood and my education.
Especially since my parents went to Florida.
Besides Eddie and I believe It is important for Kenya have a strong spiritual foundation.
I do not go to church.
The only reason to make me come is that Chance is getting married here.
Hopefully.
Anyway,
There are some very basic religious image very empty!
I determined to see my own special style.
If the front and rear a picture of ass.
... You are the salt of the earth.
Are you the light ... the world?
Everyone is ... a black hole.
Let us pray.

Sorry I'm late.
These are for you.
For your fast recovery.
Glad you're here.
There is something I must tell you.
Well.
I got my test results.
I am HIV negative.
Ricky, that's great!
For you are you so?
- Would you come up with someone who is ...?
- Negative?
This is crazy.
This is the best news.
Well.
So to go to dinner.
Why not stay?
To eat later?
Use it.
So it is better to like ...
Actually, I thought why not do something else?
Also exciting, and ...
to leave it for later?
This is equally exciting is it?
Well.
Wade?
Tarriest thou will know a lot of time?
I really need to go.
Just a minute, dear.
Three shaving cream?
Two deodorant?
Foam face mask, Gel person.
Restorative eye cream?
My God!
* Noah *
Wade?
What happened?
What is this?
My razors and my shaving brush.
And what stand?
In a cup.
Not just a cup!
My favorite cup.
We go out for months.
and I drink my green tea in this cup, every day!
This is the only that I use did not notice that?
Sorry, I used your cup.
We'll wash and return.
Yuk!
Girl, please!
Of course, there will be problems after sharing their personal space for the first time.
- Do not exaggerate!
- You have not seen the pile of male cosmetics covering my entire bathroom.
Are you afraid of most hygienic Wade habits that make it seem less a man?
It is not very progressive of you.
This is it!
I mean, I'm metrosexual, but ... damn!
How many nights you spent with it?
Do not you see everything I had to see?
Sometimes you do not want to see what's behind the curtain.
Well.
Call me crazy but I love the idea
My man just went to bed in bed and look perfect.
The dream boy of film.
Fortunately, it is only a few days.
Let's talk about something else.
Ricky?
Get out there with Dzhinito already?
Yes.
He was ... well.
- Oh, oh ...
- Exactly!
I did not have sex!
So ... not plowed field?
Since I knew I'm negative
I have this blockade in sex.
Because it is positive.
Is there a difference between:
sleep with Dzhinito, which you know is HIV positive, and sleep with thousands of other men good percentage of which are also HIV-positive.
The difference is that I know that he is HIV positive!
The real difference is I fell in love with him.
And I can not fall in love in someone who will die.
Rick, he will not die.
Well, earlier than any of us.
I know.
I just ...
Just talk to him.
Hello Dzhinito, what happens?
Forget to leave $ 20 for a wardrobe.
What?
If you treat me as happy with prostitute then pay me.
What happened last night?
I had to take care of something in my apartment and seemed so calm, I did not want to wake you.
Well.
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing yet.
Why not go through my store at ... 10 hours?
Alex, I'm done finish in a video conference room.
Will dry ... later tonight.
Well.
Now,
Do not forget that should remove paint the floor of my office and sort everything the rear wall.
Alex, this is my afternoon basketball game, remember?
Oh, you can walk without a game!
This is important!
Our clinic.
Sounds like a lot of work.
Maybe we should hire small group of workers?
Who needs workers when I got Trey?
Chance must go.
Re gonna be late for the meeting the church council.
Just copy a passage.
We must arm ourselves with ammunition to refute every homophobic passage in Bible that affect us.
... Romans, Chapter 1 verses 24 to 27.
Some theologians believe to curse men who have sex with men.
Specific in these passages is that heterosexual men sometimes had sex with male prostitutes in pagan temples and All were homosexual.
Oh, professor Counter,
What interesting theologians are the ones.
I do not see you there some connection to the dispute.
In the Bible, there Only 6 passages in which mentions homosexuality.
And my intention is to challenge any one time.
I can only imagine how disgraced must be your mother.
How can treat her like that?
She prefers to see me married to the man I love than live deceptive life as some members of this society apparently have chosen.
Leviticus: "Man can not lie with man as with woman. "
"This is an abomination."
In the same chapter is ordered eating crustaceans.
But I'm sure you do not stop to put before your eyes in full Understanding the epic church fish food!
It is not necessary you disrespectful.
Forgive me, Father.
It seems to me that when Jesus did New Testament it found all the rules violence and God's punishment.
He does not want to talk for homosexuality but he preached for love and forgiveness, and he calls us to not judge your neighbor but to embrace, so let's get out of hatred and outdated ideas and to keep true message of Jesus!
"Love your neighbor as yourself "
And love God. "
Thank you!
I do what I can.
But you have to realist about it.
What do you mean?
See.
We could discuss with them all day but we will not allow wedding is here.
He's right, Chance.
Already heard inside.
Why do we pressure on that?
Because it is important ... for me!
I will marry you and urban garbage while we welcome.
Our ceremony must be a place where you feel welcome.
Lord, took board its decision.
The board decided.
In voting three to two votes, approves your request to conducting the ceremony here.
In the reception room of the church not in the main chapel.
A reverend can not to lead the ceremony.
You know what?
Our ceremony will A celebration, and not just because your permission thank you
but not with gratitude!
Hi, Rafael.
Is he back?
- Yes, but ...
- Well, he awaits me.
I'll see you later.
Hello Dzhinito.
10 am Is it?
I guess I'm benchmark for lost time.
What happened?
Are You Mad?
We never talked for exceptions.
Do not stand so, say something!
Bugs!
Offended me!
Ricky, if you want to break up with me because it can not overcome that meet
HIV-positive
just do it!
Sorry!
I just can not ...
What are you doing?
Milo,
I wanted to surprise you.
My cup?
!
My favorite cup?
Wade ... !
I know, dear, sorry was an accident!
Can you forgive me?
Yes ... course, that you forgive.
Well.
I thought it's great to be together, so I suggest ... make it permanent.
Get rid of this apartment.
I will sell my and will get together an apartment.
Cool, eh?
Why do not you take a shower,
I'll finish with breakfast.
And then we have all day search of a house.
Search houses?
I already called my broker.
This is Ricky.
Perhaps I'm too busy.
So leave me sexy message and I'll call you.
Ricky!
Call when you hear this message, it is urgent.
Wade ...
wants to search a house.
Milo?
I can not hear the water running!
I'll be quick!
THERE ...
CONTINUED
Previously on Enterprise:
You, Denobulan come with us.
A virus is spreading from planet to planet.
Millions are already infected.
What do you want with me?
If this continues, the Klingon species will cease to exist.
There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant.
It may be the only way to save your friend's life.
You don't seriously expect me to help you create Klingon augments.
Take him.
The Malcolm Reed I know would give his life before committing treason.
There are some... obligations that go beyond my loyalty to you...
and this crew.
T'Pol to Captain Archer.
Go ahead.
The warp matrix has been compromised by a Klingon subroutine.
It's infiltrated our command protocols.
Pressure's increasing again.
Take us to warp 5.2.
Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.
We're out of options, Travis.
5.2.
And now the conclusion.
We have 47 minutes until our reactor breaches.
What did the Klingons do to it?
They altered our engineering subroutines.
If we go below warp five, the reactor's going to explode.
How can I help?
I've just been talking with Trip.
Columbia can rendezvous with us in 30 minutes.
He says he can restore the subroutines.
He can't do that from Columbia.
We're going to bring him onboard.
The transporter won't operate at warp, and docking's out of the question.
Trip told me you have experience transferring personnel at warp speed.
Training exercises, yes... and at warp speed one.
Every move was rehearsed in simulators for weeks.
We don't have weeks.
We'll have to merge our warp field with Columbia's.
T'Pol's doing the calculations now.
At warp five, we'll have to move within 50 meters of each other.
Has anyone ever done this before?
Travis can handle the flying.
Can you get Trip over here?
You'll have to let me out of this brig.
It's been a long road
Getting from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I will see my dream come alive at last
I will touch the sky
And they're not gonna hold me down no more
No, they're not gonna change my mind
'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm going where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anything
I've got strength of the soul
No one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith I've got, I've got
I've got faith
Faith of the heart.
Commander Tucker...
are you ready for this?
As ready as I'll ever be.
Open a channel.
Columbia to Enterprise...
This is Archer.
We're matching speed and trajectory as requested.
Stand by, Columbia.
Archer to Reed.
Go ahead.
We're in position.
Have them start their rotation.
Coming up on 100 meters... 90... 80 meters...
This is the bridge-- all hands brace for warp field contact.
Hold her steady, Travis, or Chef'll know who to blame for the mess in the galley.
We're at 50 meters and holding.
Make sure everything's ready for Trip in Engineering.
Archer to Reed... you're all clear.
Understood.
Columbia...
I'm deploying the tether.
Nice shooting, Malcolm.
Tucker to Captain Hernandez.
Go ahead.
I'm heading out.
Quick as you can, Commander.
Never thought I'd see the stars like this.
Eyes on the cable, Commander.
I need you back here in one piece.
You're doing fine, Trip.
T'Pol, what's happening?
I'm reading a fluctuation in the warp field.
Take power from life support if you have to, but keep the field constant!
Sir, I'm having trouble holding position... 52 meters... 55!
Don't mean to be a pest, but could someone tell me what's going on?
You're almost here, Trip!
Keep going!
Engineering, report!
I'm rerouting power now, Captain, stand by.
59 meters.
The tether's at its limit!
Hurry up!
T'Pol to the bridge.
It's not working.
The field is still fluctuating.
Almost there!
[grunting]
Trip!
Permission to come aboard?
Bridge...
I have him.
You all right, Trip?
I'll feel a lot better when this is over.
There's only one way to do this, Captain.
A cold start.
I have to shut down the reactor and reset the algorithms.
Once we bring the warp engine back on-line, the subroutines should be back to normal.
But if we shut down the reactor...
That's why we need to move inside Columbia's warp field.
They can sustain our speed while I reinitialize the engines.
They won't be able to hold us for more than a minute or two.
They don't have enough power.
I've got a shortcut in mind.
Shortcut?
Those subroutines would take hours to decrypt.
Better just to purge them... wipe them clean.
I'll contact Columbia.
What're they here for?
The Captain and I have had a slight misunderstanding.
How slight?
These gentlemen are here to escort me back to the brig.
Don't worry.
I'll tell you all about it when we're not quite so busy.
Fancy meeting you here.
Intermix pressure?
1527.
Field variance?
87 millicochranes.
Somebody hasn't been taking very good care of my engine.
Speak with the Klingons.
What are you doing?
You might want to take notes.
I'm about to perform a manual shut-down and restart in less than two minutes.
That's not possible.
Watch me.
Columbia to Enterprise.
Go ahead.
I've routed everything I've got to my warp field.
Do me a favor, Jonathan.
Make this quick.
Archer to Trip.
Ready when you are.
Stand by!
Everyone get away from the bulkheads!
It's gonna get a little hot in here!
Reactor shut down in five... four... three... two... one!
T'Pol, prime the injectors.
Jenkins, man the relays!
Yes, sir!
Columbia to Enterprise.
You've got about 40 seconds.
Understood.
Trip, how's it going?
Just another minute, Captain!
You don't have a minute!
Get ready to initialize the matrix!
Enterprise, we're losing the field!
15 seconds, Trip!
Almost there!
Full power to containment!
Fire up the antimatter stream!
Ten seconds... nine... eight... seven...
Commander?
Here we go!
four... three... two...
We've got warp power.
Engineering to the bridge.
The subroutines have been purged.
Appreciate the house call, Mr. Tucker.
Any time.
I'd like to drop to impulse for a while, Captain, just to check things over.
Stand by.
Enterprise to Columbia.
Thanks for the lift.
You're not getting away with my chief engineer that easily.
Any plans for the next few days?
What've you got in mind?
Phlox.
Phlox.
This will help.
My apologies for the general's conduct.
It's so crude.
This is no way to treat a man of science.
Then end it.
Contact Starfleet.
My people need you, Phlox.
We have no healers with your abilities.
You want me to create Klingon augments.
Living weapons.
I won't do it.
No, no.
I've been reviewing your work.
It's brilliant.
You have discovered a weakness in the virus causing the plague.
If we interrupt the transcription sequence here...
Yes.
Yes.
That would stop the genetic effects of the virus in stage one.
There'd be changes of appearance, some minor neural reordering, but no development of stage-two characteristics, no enhanced strength or speed or endurance.
But then General K'Vagh would not get his augments.
He would never allow it.
What if we don't tell him?
Do you understand what will happen if the general learns that we've deceived him?
A cure would save millions of innocent lives.
What more honorable death could there be for a healer,
Klingon or Denobulan?
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.
I've asked Columbia to join us in our search for Phlox.
We'll have a better chance of making it through Klingon territory with twice the firepower.
I don't suppose you can tell me where I'm going this time?
I didn't think so.
Those are my personal files.
Not when they affect my ship.
T'Pol restored everything you tried to erase.
We ran his face and voiceprint through our database.
His name is Harris.
He worked in Starfleet Security up till five years ago.
After that, his file ends.
Captain... there's nothing more I can add.
I won't accept that.
You endangered every member of this crew.
You answer to me.
I thought I knew you, Malcolm.
Whatever hold this Harris has on you, you could have come to me.
I'm under orders.
I'm your commanding officer!
If you don't tell me what's going on, I'll go to Starfleet.
Whatever you think you've been trying to keep hidden, is going to come out.
Is that what you want?
Is that what you want?
!
I can't tell you what I don't know.
Then let me talk to someone who can.
Send a message to Harris.
Has the House of Phlox always been one of healers?
There is no, uh, House of Phlox.
Denobulan family units are different from Klingons'.
Ah, yes.
I've heard.
Three wives for each husband.
Three husbands for each wife.
Your mating practices must be very complex.
Wondrously so.
What about the House of Antaak?
We are a warrior caste.
When I became a healer, my father disowned me.
As a physician in the Imperial Fleet, you've served in the military.
Not as well as I should have.
I did not screen my subjects properly.
This plague... all its victims...
It's my fault.
My failure is the reason you're here.
The humans could not stop us.
I am your superior.
You will salute.
Now... report.
Enterprise was destroyed.
Starfleet will think it was her engines.
One of you is missing.
Your son was slow.
The humans killed him.
Did he die with honor?
He let humans kill him.
Report.
Dr. Phlox has made excellent progress.
Details.
I've identified the RNA sequences that code...
Details I can pass on to my superiors.
I know where to look for the switch that will turn off the virus.
How long until you find it?
An hour.
One hour.
What do you want?
I have news for the High Council.
Explain.
The Denobulan is close to perfecting the augment's genome.
The Council has shut down your project.
If you sterilize this colony, then all our research will be lost.
The fleet will reach you in three days.
If you're successful, by the time we enter orbit, Qu'Vat will be spared.
[growls]
Captain, it's gonna be a while before everything's back to normal in engineering.
Can Kelby handle it?
[sighs]
I could pull a little double duty to help him out.
I can check with Captain Hernandez.
Something else?
What the hell's going on with Malcolm?
Nothing I can get into right now.
Fair enough.
Guess I'd better get back to Columbia.
I'll walk with you.
Are you enjoying your time aboard Columbia?
Sure.
Why wouldn't I?
You haven't been experiencing any problems?
Such as?
Adjusting to new food, new routines... trouble sleeping...
I sleep just fine.
How 'bout you?
Fine.
You sure about that?
Quite.
Your hour is up.
We're getting the test results now.
We are running out of time.
General...
I know the Klingon fleet is on its way, and I understand what this project cost you... personally.
Antaak told me about your son.
He died in combat for the Empire.
At least he was spared the final stage of this disease.
May I, uh... ask how he was infected?
Command chose his unit for the augment experiment when we had exhausted our supply of prisoners.
My son was a warrior.
He asked for no special treatment, and I gave him none.
What'd they give you?
It's dead.
I can't eat that.
No wonder you're all so weak.
Physical strength isn't everything.
You can't win wars without it.
Being smart is more important.
General Sun Tzu said that the greatest victories are those won without fighting.
The great Kahless said there's no victory without combat.
Do you ever question why you fight?
Soldiers don't question.
They obey.
What if your superiors are wrong?
They're imprisoned.
Or killed.
That's not how we do things in Starfleet.
Which is why the Klingon Empire will defeat you.
Then how come you're in the same brig that I'm in?
You said we'd become stronger.
This is what you've done to us.
He will become infectious soon.
He should be quarantined.
We'll remain here.
If we're going to die, we'll die together... as comrades.
Be patient, Lieutenant.
The Denobulan is working to stabilize the human DNA.
You will all be healthy again and stronger than any Klingon.
Will he restore our appearance?
I don't know.
How do you expect us to return home looking like this?
We will be outcasts.
There will be no place for us in the Empire.
Your heart is still Klingon.
Are you certain of that?
During the battle with the Starfleet ship
I felt fear for the first time since I was a child.
I wasn't alone.
I could see it in the eyes of the others.
We've become like them... weak... cowardly.
It would be better for us to die.
As long as I draw breath... the Empire will not turn its back on you.
I get the feeling you miss Phlox, too.
Or maybe it's just the stash of cheese he's got in Sick Bay.
[com beeps]
Hold that thought.
Captain Archer,
I'm told you have some questions for me.
Where's my doctor?
He's safe.
On a mission of great importance to Starfleet.
Phlox was kidnapped.
Starfleet would never authorize that.
Reread the Charter, Article 14, Section 31.
There are a few lines that make allowances for bending the rules during times of extraordinary threat.
What threat?
Take your pick.
Earth's got a lot of enemies.
Klingons attacked my ship.
Is that what we're talking about?
What I want to talk about is Lieutenant Reed.
He's done good work for us over the years.
Don't be too hard on him.
He was just following my orders.
You put him in an impossible position.
I can understand why you would feel that way, but this is bigger than one captain and one ship.
You're going to have to do better than that.
All I can tell you is that if you interfere before Phlox completes his assignment, the repercussions will affect entire worlds.
One of these four strains has the genetic trigger that can neutralize the virus before it advances to its lethal stage.
Which one?
I don't know yet.
That's why I have to check each of them.
How long will it take?
A week.
Your fleet can quarantine this world, hmm, while I complete my tests.
Sterilization is not necessary.
Fleet Admiral Krell will not extend his deadline.
The only possible way to get results on Krell's schedule is to infect four healthy Klingons!
You have four right here!
Only one of these strains will work.
The other three will be lethal.
Ethically, it's unthinkable.
The "ethics", Doctor, are simple.
Three lives to save millions.
At first, it didn't seem like lying.
What else would you call it?
Covert operations.
I was a young ensign.
It was... exciting.
How do you feel about it now?
I thought it was done.
This is the first time that Harris has contacted me since I've served on Enterprise.
He told me about the plague.
He said they needed Phlox to help the Klingons find a cure.
I was supposed to just slow us down.
Did Harris tell you about this?
I had T'Pol take a closer look at our prisoner's medical scans.
It's human DNA.
I'm guessing the plague is a side effect of a military experiment that went wrong.
I didn't know.
Harris claims he's doing this because Starfleet needs a stable Klingon Empire.
Do you believe him?
I don't trust him.
If the Klingons needed our help, there are easier ways to get it.
I wanted to tell you everything, Captain.
There's a way out of this.
I don't have to put you back in the Brig, but you have to choose where your loyalties lie.
I wasn't told where Phlox was taken, but Starfleet intelligence believe that Klingons have a genetic research facility on Qu'Vat Colony.
As you were.
How long until we reach Qu'Vat?
Six hours, sir.
Captain, we need to be ready for Klingon patrols.
I suggest that Columbia withdraws to a safer distance so that we don't make a single target.
Open a channel to Captain Hernandez.
Why did you think you'd succeed in perfecting Augments when Dr. Soong failed?
Soong's mistake was that he made too few of them.
The Earth once had thousands.
They became tyrannical and started a war.
Klingons have discipline.
Augments don't.
Their increased aggression is matched by their decreased inhibitions.
You'd lose control of them, just as humans did.
How long until we know which one of us survives?
An hour, at most.
Would bloodwine affect the results?
I don't believe so.
Then we shall drink... [chuckles] to the bravery of these warriors!
Doctor?
Never on the job.
[chuckling]
We know Phlox was taken to Qu'Vat Colony to work on a cure.
We're going to be there in less than an hour.
[coughs] Krell's patrols will crush you.
They've all been recalled to enforce quarantine zones.
Phlox will be in the medical facility.
We need the coordinates.
[coughing]
If you don't want to help us, help your people.
[sighing]
My brothers?
[whimpering]
They're quite ill, and so are you.
Try to rest.
Doctor.
The two guards are displaying the first symptoms.
That accounts for two of the three lethal strains.
So either General K'Vagh lives or I do.
It's the General, isn't it?
His strain has the cure.
If we work quickly, there's a chance we can treat you in time.
[com beeps]
What now?
There's been a complication.
[crunching noisily] Another one?
This time, your people failed to stop Enterprise.
It's on its way to Qu'Vat, with Columbia.
Order them to withdraw.
You know I don't have that authority.
Then I'll destroy them.
We had an arrangement!
You did what I wanted.
I don't need you anymore.
You agreed that both our governments would benefit if the two of us worked together.
And you believed me.
[shuts off screen] Load the amino acids.
I'll extract the viral DNA from his blood.
Captain!
You all right?
Better now that you are here.
Father.
I was told that you had been killed.
The humans spared me.
I came to get my doctor back.
We need him here.
I have two ships in orbit, heavily armed.
Gentlemen, please, I think I can speak for myself.
Captain, I need a little more time to cure this plague.
Cure?
!
You were supposed to be perfect the Augment genome!
I lied.
Your son may be alive, but he will not survive much longer unless I don't complete my work.
A few hours, Captain, that's all I ask.
Several million patients are counting on it.
[panel beeps]
Commander, three Klingon battlecruisers have just dropped out of warp.
Open a channel to Columbia.
[com static crackling]
The Klingons are jamming everything.
[Klaxon sounds]
What is it?
Krell's ships are here.
Keep working.
Archer to Enterprise.
Tell the Klingons we have the cure. [static crackling]
Enterprise, respond!
This is Fleet Admiral Krell.
I'm under orders to eradicate this colony.
You don't have to do that!
My doctor can stop the plague.
I have a more effective solution.
Hello, Admiral Krell!
This is Dr. Phlox.
I am transmitting the details of an antivirus.
Feel free to have your physicians confirm my findings, and you're welcome to call with any questions.
My orders are clear.
Captain Archer, your ships are now the property of the Klingon Empire.
Stand down or be destroyed!
Proceed as planned.
Leave nothing standing.
The lead ship's moving into a lower orbit.
They're charging weapons.
Intercept course.
Columbia?
I can't get through.
They're firing on the colony.
Target their disruptors!
How strong are the shields around this place?
Not strong enough.
You said you had two ships in orbit!
I'm sure they're doing everything they can.
Archer to Enterprise.
They're closing from astern!
Aft cannons are down!
Columbia to Enterprise.
Looked like you could use a hand.
Let's keep those ships off their tail.
Your ships are taking damage.
How much longer?
As I said, in another few hours.
Can you speed that up a little?
Phlox.
I've got an idea.
But if we want to get out of here in one piece, we've gotta get that cure, and we're gotta get it fast.
I could finish the antivirus in less time if I had a human host to replicate enough antibodies.
I don't see any other humans around.
Captain, I would have to expose you to the plague.
I cannot predict what it might do to you.
Will it give you the cure?
Unquestionably.
Let's get started.
What do you intend to do?
This virus may be our best weapon against Krell.
Ready when you are.
One of the ships is losing power.
Their port nacelle is vulnerable.
Then fire at will.
In addition to the virus, I'm injecting you with a metabolic catalyst to accelerate your immune response.
It won't be pleasant.
It's no use.
I can't penetrate their shields.
Commander!
I've broken through their jamming frequencies.
T'Pol to Captain Archer.
Captain, respond!
Doctor Phlox here.
The Captain is indisposed at the moment.
I imagine you have your hands full up there.
To say the least.
We have a plan to defuse this situation, but we'll need a few more minutes to carry it out.
I'd appreciate it if you could keep the ceiling from caving in on us until then.
Understood.
How much hull plating do we have left?
Sixty two percent.
Mr. Mayweather...
put us directly between that Cruiser and the colony.
You may want to divert all available power to our dorsal plating.
Aye, aye.
[gasping]
It's working.
[groaning]
They're shifting their orbit!
Stay with them.
Hull plating's down to 40%.
Keep firing!
Captain Hernandez, please direct your weapons at the battle cruiser.
Wish I could help.
We just lost our weapons!
[snarling]
It's done!
Hold him!
[screaming]
We've got it!
Is the canister ready?
It's set to disperse five seconds after transport.
Send it.
Open a channel to Krell.
Hull plating's nearly down.
We can't hold this position much longer.
Admiral Krell.
Doctor Phlox again.
By now you may have noticed the small package which we sent to your bridge.
What you may not know is that it contains a potent sample of the metagenic virus.
Even as we speak, it's dispersing throughout your ship...
infecting you and your crew.
You're lying!
Check your internal sensors.
You will find that the atmosphere contains approximately twenty parts per million of the viral strain.
Or if you don't trust your sensors, trust your senses.
You will feel the initial symptoms in about 30 minutes-- tightness in the chest, irregular heartbeat, tingling in your cranial ridges...
This is a cowardly attack!
Maybe so.
But I'm prepared to give you the cure.
Thanks to Captain Archer, I've managed to complete the antivirus.
Of course, if you destroy this colony, well, treating you and your crew could prove difficult.
I suggest you power down your weapons, Admiral, and let me cure your people.
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.
Admiral Krell has convinced the High Council to call off their sterilization program.
They've promised to distribute Phlox's cure throughout the Empire.
There's no trace of the virus in your bloodstream.
My targ won't even recognize me.
In the future it may be possible to reverse the cosmetic effects.
I suppose this is what I deserve.
Millions of my people will have to live with this disfigurement.
It'll be passed on to our children.
Life won't be easy for us.
You did your best to correct your mistakes.
That's all we can ask of ourselves.
I doubt my superiors will allow me to remain in my position.
I'll need to find a new specialty...
Perhaps cranial reconstruction...
I have a feeling that's about to become very popular.
I'm grateful for everything that you've done.
How are you feeling?
Not too bad... aside from some strange cravings.
A plate full of live gagh sounds pretty good right now.
[chuckles]
The cravings should disappear in a day or so...
along with your ridges.
I'd keep them if I were you, Captain.
Yeah, makes you look intimidating.
I should be get back on the road.
One of us needs to get some exploring done.
Thanks for your help.
I don't know how you survived all these years without me.
Shouldn't you be joining her?
I asked Trip to stick around for a little while-- help us out with repairs.
Indeed.
Our new Chief Engineer will no doubt be delighted for the help.
No, Kelby's got nothing to worry about.
I'm only here temporarily.
[beep]
What do you want?
I called to thank you.
Everything went according to our projections.
The Empire's been stabilized.
I doubt very much they'll be experimenting with Augments anytime soon.
We could've explained everything to Captain Archer.
That's not how Krell wanted things done.
Since when do we do things the way the Klingons want?
When it's in our interest.
I had to keep certain details from you as well.
I hope there are no hard feelings.
This mission wouldn't have succeeded without you, Lieutenant.
Don't ever contact me again.
Is that clear?
Maybe you didn't understand our recruitment policy.
You can't simply walk away.
I answer to one commanding officer...
Jonathan Archer.
Lieutenant, why don't we...
Previously on Enterprise:
You, Denobulan, come with us.
A virus is spreading from planet to planet.
Millions are already infected.
What do you want with me?
If this continues, the Klingon species will cease to exist.
There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant.
It may be the only way to save your friend's life.
You don't seriously expect me to help you create Klingon Augments?
Take him.
The Malcolm Reed I know would give his life before committing treason.
There are some obligations... that go beyond my loyalty to you and this crew.
-T'Pol to Captain Archer.
-Go ahead.
The warp matrix has been compromised by a Klingon subroutine.
It's infiltrated our command protocols.
Pressure's increasing again.
-T ake us to warp 5.2.
-Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.
We're out of options, Travis.
5.2.
And now, the conclusion.
We've 47 minutes until our reactor breaches.
What did the Klingons do to it?
They altered our engineering subroutines.
If we go below warp 5, the reactor's going to explode.
-How can I help?
-I've just been talking with Trip.
Columbia can rendezvous with us in 30 minutes.
He says he can restore the subroutines.
-He can't do that from Columbia.
-We're gonna bring him on board.
The Transporter won't operate at warp and docking's out of the question.
Trip told me you have experience transferring personnel at warp speed.
In training exercises, yes, but at warp speed 1.
Every move was rehearsed in simulators for weeks.
We don't have weeks.
We'll have to merge our warp field with Columbia's.
T'Pol's doing the calculations now.
At warp 5, we'll have to move within 50 metres of each other.
Has anyone ever done this before?
Travis can handle the flying.
Can you get Trip over here?
You'll have to let me out of this Brig.
It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I will see my dream Come alive at last
I will touch the sky
And they're not gonna Hold me down no more
No, they're not gonna change my mind
'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm going where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anything
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith
I've got faith
Faith of the heart
Commander Tucker, are you ready for this?
As ready as I'll ever be.
Open a channel.
-Columbia to Enterprise.
-This is Archer.
We're matching speed and trajectory as requested.
Stand by, Columbia.
Archer to Reed.
-Go ahead.
-We're in position.
Have them start their rotation.
Coming up on 100 metres.
90, 80 metres.
This is the Bridge.
All hands brace for warp field contact.
Hold her steady, Travis... or Chef will know who to blame for the mess in the Galley.
We're at 50 metres and holding.
Make sure everything's ready for Trip in Engineering.
Archer to Reed.
You're all clear.
Understood.
Columbia, I'm deploying the tether.
Nice shooting, Malcolm.
Tucker to Captain Hernandez.
-Go ahead.
-I'm heading out.
Quick as you can, Commander.
Never thought I'd see the stars like this.
Eyes on the cable, Commander.
I need you back here in one piece.
You're doing fine, Trip.
T'Pol, what's happening?
I'm reading a fluctuation in the warp field.
Take power from life support if you have to, but keep the field constant.
Sir, I'm having trouble holding position.
52 metres, 55.
Don't mean to be a pest, but could someone tell me what's going on?
You're almost here, Trip.
Keep going.
Engineering, report!
I'm re-routing power now, Captain.
Stand by.
59 metres.
The tether's at its limit!
Hurry up!
T'Pol to the Bridge.
It's not working.
Field is still fluctuating.
Almost there!
Permission to come aboard?
Bridge, I have him.
-You all right, Trip?
-I'll feel a lot better when this is over.
There's only one way to do this, Captain: a cold start.
I have to shut down the reactor, and re-set the algorithms.
Once we bring the warp engine back online... the subroutines should be back to normal.
But if we shut down the reactor--
That's why we need to move inside Columbia's warp field.
They can sustain our speed while I re-initialise the engines.
They won't be able to hold us for more than a minute or two.
-They don't have enough power.
-I've got a shortcut in mind.
Shortcut?
Those subroutines would take hours to decrypt.
Better just to purge them, wipe them clean.
I'll contact Columbia.
I'll contact Columbia.
What are they here for?
The Captain and I have had a slight misunderstanding.
How slight?
These gentlemen are here to escort me back to the Brig.
Don't worry, I'll tell you all about it when we're not quite so busy.
Fancy meeting you here.
-lntermix pressure?
-1527.
-Field variance?
-87 millicochranes.
Somebody hasn't been taking very good care of my engine.
Speak with the Klingons.
-What are you doing?
-You might want to take notes.
I'm about to perform a manual shutdown and re-start in less than two minutes.
-That's not possible.
-Watch me.
-Columbia to Enterprise.
-Go ahead.
I've routed everything I've got to my warp field.
Do me a favour, Jonathan.
Make this quick.
Archer to Trip.
Ready when you are.
Stand by!
Everyone get away from the bulkheads!
It's gonna get a little hot in here!
Reactor shut down in five, four... three, two, one!
T'Pol, prime the injectors.
-Jenkins, man the relays.
-Yes, sir.
Columbia to Enterprise.
You've got about 40 seconds.
Understood.
Trip, how's it going?
-Just another minute, Captain.
-You don't have a minute.
Get ready to initialise the matrix!
Enterprise, we're losing the field.
15 seconds, Trip.
Almost there.
Full power to containment.
Fire up the antimatter stream!
Ten seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six.
Commander!
-Here we go!
-Four, three, two.
We've got warp power.
Engineering to the Bridge.
Subroutines have been purged.
-Appreciate the house call, Mr. Tucker.
-Anytime.
I'd like to drop to impulse for a while, Captain, just to check things over.
Stand by.
Enterprise to Columbia.
Thanks for the lift.
You're not getting away with my Chief Engineer that easily.
-Any plans for the next few days?
-What've you got in mind?
Phlox.
This will help.
My apologies for the General's conduct.
So cruel.
This is no way to treat a man of science.
Then end it.
Contact Starfleet.
My people need you, Phlox.
We have no healers with your abilities.
You want me to create Klingon Augments, living weapons.
I won't do it.
No.
I've been reviewing your work.
It's brilliant!
You have discovered a weakness in the virus causing the plague.
If we interrupt the transcription sequence here....
Yes.
That would stop... the genetic effects of the virus in Stage One.
There'd be changes of appearance, some minor neural reordering... but no development of Stage Two characteristics.
No enhanced strength or speed or endurance.
But then General K'Vagh would not get his Augments.
He would never allow it.
What if we don't tell him?
Do you understand what will happen... if the General learns that we've deceived him?
The cure would save millions of innocent lives.
What more honourable death could there be for a healer...
Klingon or Denobulan?
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.
I've asked Columbia to join us in our search for Phlox.
We'll have a better chance of making it through Klingon territory... with twice the firepower.
I don't suppose you can tell me where I'm going this time?
No, I didn't think so.
-Those are my personal files.
-Not when they affect my ship.
T'Pol restored everything you tried to erase.
We ran his face and voiceprint through our database.
His name's Harris.
He worked in Starfleet Security... up till five years ago.
After that, his file ends.
Captain...
-there's nothing more I can add.
-I won't accept that!
You endangered every member of this crew.
You answer to me.
I thought I knew you, Malcolm.
Whatever hold this Harris has on you... you could've come to me.
-I'm under orders.
-I'm your Commanding Officer!
If you don't tell me what's going on, I'll go to Starfleet.
Whatever you think you've been trying to keep hidden is going to come out.
Is that what you want?
I can't tell you what I don't know.
Then let me talk to someone who can.
Send a message to Harris.
Has the House of Phlox always been one of healers?
There is no House of Phlox.
Denobulan family units are different from Klingons.
Yes, I've heard.
Three wives for each husband.
Three husbands for each wife.
Your mating practices must be very complex.
Wondrously so.
-What about the House of Antaak?
-We are a warrior caste.
When I became a healer, my father disowned me.
As a physician in the lmperial Fleet, you've served in the military.
Not as well as I should have.
I did not screen my subjects properly.
This plague, all its victims... it's my fault.
My failure is the reason you're here.
The humans could not stop us.
I am your superior.
You will salute.
Now, report.
Enterprise was destroyed.
Starfleet will think it was her engines.
One of you is missing.
Your son was slow.
The humans killed him.
Did he die with honour?
He let humans kill him.
Report.
-Dr.
Phlox has made excellent progress.
-Details.
I've identified the RNA sequences that code--
Details I can pass on to my superiors.
I know where to look for the switch that will turn off the virus.
-How long until you find it?
-An hour.
One hour.
What do you want?
-I have news for the High Council.
-Explain.
The Denobulan is close to perfecting the Augments' genome.
The Council has shut down your project.
If you sterilise this colony, then all our research will be lost.
The fleet will reach you in three days.
If you're successful by the time we get to orbit, Qu'Vat will be spared.
Captain, it's gonna be a while... before everything's back to normal in Engineering.
Can Kelby handle it?
I could pull a little double duty to help him out.
I could check with Captain Hernandez.
Something else?
What the hell's going on with Malcolm?
Nothing I can get into right now.
Fair enough.
Guess I'd better get back to Columbia.
I'll walk with you.
Are you enjoying your time aboard Columbia?
Sure, why wouldn't I?
You haven't been experiencing any problems?
Such as?
Adjusting to new food, new routines... trouble sleeping.
-I sleep just fine.
How about you?
-Fine.
-You sure about that?
-Quite.
Your hour is up.
-We are getting the test results now.
-We are running out of time!
General, I know the Klingon fleet is on its way... and I understand what this project cost you, personally.
-Antaak told me about your son.
-He died in combat for the Empire.
At least he was spared the final stage of this disease.
May I ask how he was infected?
Command chose his unit for the Augment experiment... when we had exhausted our supply of prisoners.
My son was a warrior.
He asked for no special treatment, and I gave him none.
-What'd they give you?
-It's dead.
I can't eat that.
No wonder you're all so weak.
-Physical strength isn't everything.
-Well, you can't win wars without it.
Being smart is more important.
General Sun Tzu said that the greatest victories... are those won without fighting.
The great Kahless said there's no victory without combat.
Do you ever question why you fight?
Soldiers don't question.
They obey.
What if your superiors are wrong?
They're imprisoned, or killed.
That's not how we do things in Starfleet.
Which is why the Klingon Empire will defeat you.
Then how come you're in the same Brig that I'm in?
You said we'd become stronger.
This is what you've done to us.
He will become infectious so he should be quarantined.
We'll remain here.
If we're going to die, we'll die together... as comrades.
Be patient, Lieutenant.
The Denobulan is working to stabilise the human DNA.
You will all be healthy again, and stronger than any Klingon.
-Will he restore our appearance?
-I don't know.
How do you expect us to return home looking like this?
We will be outcasts.
There will be no place for us in the Empire.
Your heart is still Klingon.
Are you certain of that?
During the battle with the Starfleet ship...
I felt fear for the first time since I was a child.
I wasn't alone.
I could see it in the eyes of the others.
We've become like them.
Weak, cowardly.
It would be better for us to die.
As long as I draw breath... the Empire will not turn its back on you.
I get the feeling you miss Phlox, too.
Maybe it's just the stash of cheese he's got in Sickbay.
Hold that thought.
Captain Archer, I'm told you have some questions for me.
-Where's my doctor?
-He's safe... on a mission of great importance to Starfleet.
Phlox was kidnapped.
Starfleet would never authorise that.
Reread the Charter.
Article 14, Section 31.
There are a few lines that make allowances... for bending the rules during times of extraordinary threat.
-What threat?
- Take your pick.
-Earth's got a lot of enemies.
-Klingons attacked my ship.
Is that what we're talking about?
What I wanna talk about is Lieutenant Reed.
He's done good work for us over the years.
Don't be too hard on him.
He was just following my orders.
You put him in an impossible position.
I can understand why you would feel that way... but this is bigger than one captain, and one ship.
You're gonna have to do better than that.
All I can tell you is that if you interfere... before Phlox completes his assignment... the repercussions will affect entire worlds.
One of these four strains has the genetic trigger... that can neutralise the virus before it advances to its lethal stage.
Which one?
I don't know yet.
That's why I have to check each of them.
How long will it take?
A week.
Your fleet can quarantine this world, while I complete my tests.
Sterilisation is not necessary.
Fleet Admiral Krell will not extend his deadline.
The only possible way to get results on Krell's schedule... is to infect four healthy Klingons.
You have four right here!
Only one of these strains will work.
The other three will be lethal.
-Ethically, it's unthinkable!
-The ethics, Doctor, are simple.
Three lives to save millions.
At first, it didn't seem like lying.
-What else would you call it?
-Covert operations.
I was a young ensign, it was exciting.
-How do you feel about it now?
-I thought it was done.
This is the first time that Harris has contacted me... since I've served on Enterprise.
He told me about the plague.
He said they needed Phlox to help the Klingons find a cure.
I was supposed to just slow us down.
Did Harris tell you about this?
I had T'Pol take a closer look at our prisoner's medical scans.
It's human DNA.
I'm guessing the plague is a side-effect... of a military experiment that went wrong.
I didn't know.
Harris claims he's doing this... because Starfleet needs a stable Klingon Empire.
Do you believe him?
I don't trust him.
If the Klingons needed our help, there are easier ways to get it.
I wanted to tell you everything, Captain.
There's a way out of this.
I don't have to put you back in the Brig... but you have to choose where your loyalties lie.
I wasn't told where Phlox was taken but Starfleet Intelligence believes... the Klingons have a genetic research facility... on Qu'Vat Colony.
As you were.
-How long until we reach Qu'Vat?
-Six hours, sir.
Captain, we need to be ready for Klingon patrols.
I suggest that Columbia withdraws to a safer distance... so that we don't make a single target.
Open a channel to Captain Hernandez.
Why did you think you'd succeed in perfecting Augments... when Dr. Soong failed?
Soong's mistake was that he made too few of them.
Earth once had thousands.
They became tyrannical and started a war.
-Klingons have discipline.
-Augments don't.
Their increased aggression is matched by their decreased inhibitions.
You'd lose control of them, just as humans did.
How long until we know which one of us survives?
An hour, at most.
Would bloodwine affect the results?
I don't believe so.
Then we shall drink... to the bravery of these warriors.
-Doctor!
-Never on the job.
We know Phlox was taken to Qu'Vat Colony to work on a cure.
We're gonna be there in less than an hour.
Krell's patrols will crush you.
They've all been recalled to enforce quarantine zones.
Phlox will be in the medical facility.
We need the coordinates.
If you don't wanna help us, help your people.
My brothers.
They're quite ill.
So are you.
Try to rest.
Doctor.
The two guards are displaying the first symptoms.
That accounts for two of the three lethal strains.
So either General K'Vagh lives, or I do.
It's the General, isn't it?
His strain has the cure.
If we work quickly, there's a chance we can treat you in time.
If we work quickly, there's a chance we can treat you in time.
-What now?
-There's been a complication.
Another one?
This time, your people failed to stop Enterprise.
It's on its way to Qu'Vat, with Columbia.
-Order them to withdraw.
-You know I don't have that authority.
-Then I'll destroy them.
-We had an arrangement.
You did what I wanted.
I don't need you anymore.
You agreed that both our governments would benefit... if the two of us worked together.
And you believed me.
Load the amino acids.
I'll extract the viral DNA from his blood.
-Captain.
-You all right?
Better, now that you're here.
Father.
I was told that you had been killed.
-The humans spared me.
-I came to get my doctor back.
-We need him here.
-I have two ships in orbit, heavily armed.
Gentlemen, please.
I think I can speak for myself.
Captain.
I need a little more time to cure this plague.
Cure?
You were supposed to perfect the Augment genome!
I lied.
Your son may be alive... but he will not survive much longer unless I complete my work.
A few hours, Captain.
That's all I ask.
Several million patients are counting on it.
Commander... three Klingon battle cruisers have just dropped out of warp.
Open a channel to Columbia.
The Klingons are jamming everything.
-What is it?
-Krell's ships are here.
Keep working.
Archer to Enterprise.
Tell the Klingons we have the cure.
Enterprise, respond.
This is Fleet Admiral Krell.
I'm under orders to eradicate this colony.
You don't have to do that.
My doctor can stop the plague.
I have a more effective solution.
Hello, Admiral Krell.
This is Dr. Phlox.
I am transmitting the details of an antivirus.
Feel free to have your physicians confirm my findings... and you're welcome to call with any questions.
My orders are clear.
Captain Archer... your ships are now the property of the Klingon Empire.
Stand down or be destroyed.
Proceed as planned.
Leave nothing standing.
The lead ship's moving into a lower orbit.
-They're charging weapons.
-intercept course.
Columbia.
-I can't get through.
-They're firing on the colony.
Target their disruptors.
How strong are the shields around this place?
Not strong enough!
You said you had two ships in orbit!
I'm sure they're doing everything they can.
Archer to Enterprise.
They're closing from astern.
Aft cannons are down.
Columbia to Enterprise.
Looked like you could use a hand.
Let's keep those ships off their tail.
Your ships are taking damage.
-How much longer?
-As I said, another few hours.
Can you speed that up a little?
Phlox, I've got an idea.
If we wanna get out of here in one piece... we've gotta get that cure and we've got to get it fast.
I could finish the antivirus in less time... if I had a human host to replicate enough antibodies.
I don't see any other humans around.
Captain, I would have to expose you to the plague.
I cannot predict what it might do to you.
-Will it give you the cure?
-Unquestionably.
Let's get started.
What do you intend to do?
This virus may be our best weapon against Krell.
Ready when you are.
One of the ships is losing power.
-Their port nacelle is vulnerable.
-Then fire at will.
In addition to the virus, I'm injecting you with a metabolic catalyst... to accelerate your immune response.
It won't be pleasant.
It's no use.
I can't penetrate their shields.
Commander.
I've broken through their jamming frequencies.
T'Pol to Captain Archer.
Captain, respond!
Doctor Phlox here.
The Captain is indisposed at the moment.
I imagine you have your hands full up there.
T o say the least.
We have a plan to defuse the situation... but we'll need a few more minutes to carry it out.
I'd appreciate it if you could keep... the ceiling from caving in on us until then.
Understood.
-How much hull plating do we have left?
-62%.
Mr. Mayweather, put us directly between that cruiser and the colony.
You may wanna divert all available power to our dorsal plating.
Aye, aye.
It's working.
-They're shifting their orbit.
-Stay with them.
-Hull plating's down to 40%.
-Keep firing.
Captain Hernandez, please direct your weapons at the battle cruiser.
Wish I could help.
We just lost our weapons.
It's done.
Hold him.
We've got it!
Is the canister ready?
It's set to disperse five seconds after transport.
Send it.
Open a channel to Krell.
Hull plating's nearly down.
We can't hold this position much longer.
Admiral Krell, Dr. Phlox again.
By now you may have noticed the small package... which we sent to your Bridge.
What you may not know is that it contains... a potent sample of the metagenic virus.
Even as we speak, it is dispersing throughout your ship...
-infecting you and your crew.
-You're lying!
Check your internal sensors.
You will find that the atmosphere contains... approximately 20 parts per million of the viral strain.
Or if you don't trust your sensors, trust your senses.
You will feel the initial symptoms in about 30 minutes.
A tightness in the chest, irregular heartbeat... tingling in your cranial ridges.
This is a cowardly attack!
Maybe so.
But I am prepared to give you the cure.
Thanks to Captain Archer, I have managed to complete the antivirus.
Of course, if you destroy this colony, well... treating you and your crew could prove difficult.
I suggest you power down your weapons, Admiral... and let me cure your people.
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.
Admiral Krell has convinced the High Council... to call off their sterilisation programme.
They've promised to distribute Phlox's cure throughout the Empire.
There's no trace of the virus in your bloodstream.
My targ won't even recognise me.
In the future, it may be possible to reverse the cosmetic effects.
I suppose this is what I deserve.
Millions of my people will have to live with this disfigurement.
It'll be passed on to our children.
Life won't be easy for us.
You did your best to correct your mistakes.
That's all we can ask of ourselves.
I doubt my superiors will allow me to remain in my position.
I'll need to find a new speciality.
Perhaps cranial reconstruction.
I have a feeling that's about to become very popular.
I'm grateful for everything that you've done.
How are you feeling?
Not too bad, aside from some strange cravings.
A plateful of live gagh sounds pretty good right now.
The cravings should disappear in a day or so, along with your ridges.
No, I'd keep them if I were you, Captain.
It makes you look intimidating.
I should get back on the road.
One of us needs to get some exploring done.
Thanks for your help.
I don't know how you survived all these years without me.
Shouldn't you be joining her?
I asked Trip to stick around for a little while to help us out with repairs.
Indeed.
Our new Chief Engineer will no doubt be delighted for the help.
No, Kelby's got nothing to be worried about.
I'm only here temporarily.
-What do you want?
-I called to thank you.
Everything went according to our projections.
The Empire's been stabilised.
I doubt very much they'll be experimenting... with Augments any time soon.
We could've explained everything to Captain Archer.
That's not how Krell wanted things done.
Since when do we do things the way the Klingons want?
When it's in our interest.
I had to keep certain details from you as well.
I hope there are no hard feelings.
This mission wouldn't have succeeded without you, Lieutenant.
Don't ever contact me again.
Is that clear?
Maybe you didn't understand our recruitment policy.
You can't simply walk away.
I answer to one Commanding Officer, Jonathan Archer.
Lieutenant, why don't we--
Previously on Enterprise:
You, Denobulan, come with us.
A virus is spreading from planet to planet.
Millions are already infected.
What do you want with me?
If this continues, the Klingon species will cease to exist.
There's a job that needs doing, Lieutenant.
It may be the only way to save your friend's life.
You don't seriously expect me to help you create Klingon Augments?
Take him.
The Malcolm Reed I know would give his life before committing treason.
There are some obligations... that go beyond my loyalty to you and this crew.
-T'Pol to Captain Archer.
-Go ahead.
The warp matrix has been compromised by a Klingon subroutine.
It's infiltrated our command protocols.
Pressure's increasing again.
-T ake us to warp 5.2.
-Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.
We're out of options, Travis.
5.2.
And now, the conclusion.
We've 47 minutes until our reactor breaches.
What did the Klingons do to it?
They altered our engineering subroutines.
If we go below warp 5, the reactor's going to explode.
-How can I help?
-I've just been talking with Trip.
Columbia can rendezvous with us in 30 minutes.
He says he can restore the subroutines.
-He can't do that from Columbia.
-We're gonna bring him on board.
The Transporter won't operate at warp and docking's out of the question.
Trip told me you have experience transferring personnel at warp speed.
In training exercises, yes, but at warp speed 1.
Every move was rehearsed in simulators for weeks.
We don't have weeks.
We'll have to merge our warp field with Columbia's.
T'Pol's doing the calculations now.
At warp 5, we'll have to move within 50 metres of each other.
Has anyone ever done this before?
Travis can handle the flying.
Can you get Trip over here?
You'll have to let me out of this Brig.
It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here
It's been a long time
But my time is finally near
And I will see my dream Come alive at last
I will touch the sky
And they're not gonna Hold me down no more
No, they're not gonna change my mind
'Cause I've got faith of the heart
I'm going where my heart will take me
I've got faith to believe
I can do anything
I've got strength of the soul
And no one's gonna bend or break me
I can reach any star
I've got faith
I've got faith
Faith of the heart
Commander T ucker, are you ready for this?
As ready as I'll ever be.
Open a channel.
-Columbia to Enterprise.
-This is Archer.
We're matching speed and trajectory as requested.
Stand by, Columbia.
Archer to Reed.
-Go ahead.
-We're in position.
Have them start their rotation.
Coming up on 100 metres.
90, 80 metres.
This is the Bridge.
All hands brace for warp field contact.
Hold her steady, Travis... or Chef will know who to blame for the mess in the Galley.
We're at 50 metres and holding.
Make sure everything's ready for Trip in Engineering.
Archer to Reed.
You're all clear.
Understood.
Columbia, I'm deploying the tether.
Nice shooting, Malcolm.
Tucker to Captain Hernandez.
-Go ahead.
-I'm heading out.
Quick as you can, Commander.
Never thought I'd see the stars like this.
Eyes on the cable, Commander.
I need you back here in one piece.
You're doing fine, Trip.
T'Pol, what's happening?
I'm reading a fluctuation in the warp field.
Take power from life support if you have to, but keep the field constant.
Sir, I'm having trouble holding position.
52 metres, 55.
Don't mean to be a pest, but could someone tell me what's going on?
You're almost here, Trip.
Keep going.
Engineering, report!
I'm re-routing power now, Captain.
Stand by.
59 metres.
The tether's at its limit!
Hurry up!
T'Pol to the Bridge.
It's not working.
Field is still fluctuating.
Almost there!
Permission to come aboard?
Bridge, I have him.
-You all right, Trip?
-I'll feel a lot better when this is over.
There's only one way to do this, Captain: a cold start.
I have to shut down the reactor, and re-set the algorithms.
Once we bring the warp engine back online... the subroutines should be back to normal.
But if we shut down the reactor--
That's why we need to move inside Columbia's warp field.
They can sustain our speed while I re-initialise the engines.
They won't be able to hold us for more than a minute or two.
-They don't have enough power.
-I've got a shortcut in mind.
Shortcut?
Those subroutines would take hours to decrypt.
Better just to purge them, wipe them clean.
I'll contact Columbia.
I'll contact Columbia.
What are they here for?
The Captain and I have had a slight misunderstanding.
How slight?
These gentlemen are here to escort me back to the Brig.
Don't worry, I'll tell you all about it when we're not quite so busy.
Fancy meeting you here.
-lntermix pressure?
-1527.
-Field variance?
-87 millicochranes.
Somebody hasn't been taking very good care of my engine.
Speak with the Klingons.
-What are you doing?
-You might want to take notes.
I'm about to perform a manual shutdown and re-start in less than two minutes.
-That's not possible.
-Watch me.
-Columbia to Enterprise.
-Go ahead.
I've routed everything I've got to my warp field.
Do me a favour, Jonathan.
Make this quick.
Archer to Trip.
Ready when you are.
Stand by!
Everyone get away from the bulkheads!
It's gonna get a little hot in here!
Reactor shut down in five, four... three, two, one!
T'Pol, prime the injectors.
-Jenkins, man the relays.
-Yes, sir.
Columbia to Enterprise.
You've got about 40 seconds.
Understood.
Trip, how's it going?
-Just another minute, Captain.
-You don't have a minute.
Get ready to initialise the matrix!
Enterprise, we're losing the field.
15 seconds, Trip.
Almost there.
Full power to containment.
Fire up the antimatter stream!
Ten seconds.
Nine, eight, seven, six.
Commander!
-Here we go!
-Four, three, two.
We've got warp power.
Engineering to the Bridge.
Subroutines have been purged.
-Appreciate the house call, Mr. Tucker.
-Anytime.
I'd like to drop to impulse for a while, Captain, just to check things over.
Stand by.
Enterprise to Columbia.
Thanks for the lift.
You're not getting away with my Chief Engineer that easily.
-Any plans for the next few days?
-What've you got in mind?
Phlox.
This will help.
My apologies for the General's conduct.
So cruel.
This is no way to treat a man of science.
Then end it.
Contact Starfleet.
My people need you, Phlox.
We have no healers with your abilities.
You want me to create Klingon Augments, living weapons.
I won't do it.
No.
I've been reviewing your work.
It's brilliant!
You have discovered a weakness in the virus causing the plague.
If we interrupt the transcription sequence here....
Yes.
That would stop... the genetic effects of the virus in Stage One.
There'd be changes of appearance, some minor neural reordering... but no development of Stage Two characteristics.
No enhanced strength or speed or endurance.
But then General K'Vagh would not get his Augments.
He would never allow it.
What if we don't tell him?
Do you understand what will happen... if the General learns that we've deceived him?
The cure would save millions of innocent lives.
What more honourable death could there be for a healer...
Klingon or Denobulan?
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.
I've asked Columbia to join us in our search for Phlox.
We'll have a better chance of making it through Klingon territory... with twice the firepower.
I don't suppose you can tell me where I'm going this time?
No, I didn't think so.
-Those are my personal files.
-Not when they affect my ship.
T'Pol restored everything you tried to erase.
We ran his face and voiceprint through our database.
His name's Harris.
He worked in Starfleet Security... up till five years ago.
After that, his file ends.
Captain...
-there's nothing more I can add.
-I won't accept that!
You endangered every member of this crew.
You answer to me.
I thought I knew you, Malcolm.
Whatever hold this Harris has on you... you could've come to me.
-I'm under orders.
-I'm your Commanding Officer!
If you don't tell me what's going on, I'll go to Starfleet.
Whatever you think you've been trying to keep hidden is going to come out.
Is that what you want?
I can't tell you what I don't know.
Then let me talk to someone who can.
Send a message to Harris.
Has the House of Phlox always been one of healers?
There is no House of Phlox.
Denobulan family units are different from Klingons.
Yes, I've heard.
Three wives for each husband.
Three husbands for each wife.
Your mating practices must be very complex.
Wondrously so.
-What about the House of Antaak?
-We are a warrior caste.
When I became a healer, my father disowned me.
As a physician in the lmperial Fleet, you've served in the military.
Not as well as I should have.
I did not screen my subjects properly.
This plague, all its victims... it's my fault.
My failure is the reason you're here.
The humans could not stop us.
I am your superior.
You will salute.
Now, report.
Enterprise was destroyed.
Starfleet will think it was her engines.
One of you is missing.
Your son was slow.
The humans killed him.
Did he die with honour?
He let humans kill him.
Report.
-Dr.
Phlox has made excellent progress.
-Details.
I've identified the RNA sequences that code--
Details I can pass on to my superiors.
I know where to look for the switch that will turn off the virus.
-How long until you find it?
-An hour.
One hour.
What do you want?
-I have news for the High Council.
-Explain.
The Denobulan is close to perfecting the Augments' genome.
The Council has shut down your project.
If you sterilise this colony, then all our research will be lost.
The fleet will reach you in three days.
If you're successful by the time we get to orbit, Qu'Vat will be spared.
Captain, it's gonna be a while... before everything's back to normal in Engineering.
Can Kelby handle it?
I could pull a little double duty to help him out.
I could check with Captain Hernandez.
Something else?
What the hell's going on with Malcolm?
Nothing I can get into right now.
Fair enough.
Guess I'd better get back to Columbia.
I'll walk with you.
Are you enjoying your time aboard Columbia?
Sure, why wouldn't I?
You haven't been experiencing any problems?
Such as?
Adjusting to new food, new routines... trouble sleeping.
-I sleep just fine.
How about you?
-Fine.
-You sure about that?
-Quite.
Your hour is up.
-We are getting the test results now.
-We are running out of time!
General, I know the Klingon fleet is on its way... and I understand what this project cost you, personally.
-Antaak told me about your son.
-He died in combat for the Empire.
At least he was spared the final stage of this disease.
May I ask how he was infected?
Command chose his unit for the Augment experiment... when we had exhausted our supply of prisoners.
My son was a warrior.
He asked for no special treatment, and I gave him none.
