That last blast took out life support.
The backups aren't responding.
Right now, we're shallow-breathing.
- Meaning?
- Meaning that in under nine hours we're all gonna suffocate.
As long as we don't worry about shields and weapons we may be able to cannibalize parts from other systems in order to create a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we got that up and running the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we concoct.
- But it's worth a try.
- Yes, but regardless we need more electricians and welders than are certified on this ship.
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.
- Teams assembling on every deck.
- Good, good.
Now we're talking.
How many more of these do we have?
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard?
In and around the 200 mark.
Buddy-breathing our way through is out of the question.
- I'm afraid so, sir.
Yes.
- Okay, fine.
They're for people working on life support.
- We need those people clear-headed.
- By " those people" ou "?
- I'll be one.
- How many levels inaccessible?
- Seven.
- We need to find out if there's pockets of atmosphere.
We may squeeze another hour from the regions sealed off.
- We can't transfer the O2 where we need.
- We could...
We'll be able to access panels closed off.
Get Sheppard in a 302.
He can eyeball it from the outside.
I'll take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an EVA?
Space suits were stored in those sections.
- All right, I'm heading back.
- Copy that.
Have you tried routing from the inertial?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications?
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send.
Even if we were able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith.
Letting someone know the sacrifice we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
There's also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor.
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.
You would be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'll take my chances.
I admire your courage, colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes.
That could work.
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it onboard?
- Yes, we do.
Michael's disabled their jamming codes...
- We finish the plan we started.
- We beam over the gas and wait.
We wait long enough, they won't wanna put up a fight.
They'll be humans with no memories.
I might actually survive this.
We're almost out of air.
The retrovirus takes 10 hours to run its course.
Yeah, well, we'll rotate the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship?
I could.
What do you say, colonel?
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, sir.
- Anything?
- No.
No contacts yet.
Our tests of the Mark-ll generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.
" Promising. " That doesn't sound very promising.
We're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships but doing so will probably require the last of our drones and there goes our secret weapon.
We'd really rather not have to do that.
How'd it go with the I. O. A?
Oh, you know.
I mean, does anyone ever come out of an I. O.A. Deposition saying:
" That went well" ou "?
No, I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
At least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're gonna ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just gonna ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, general.
Yeah, you did.
I lost some of the best people...
You proceeded with the blessing of the I. O.A.
And Stargate Command, as I recall.
Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.
Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts.
And I think you've got that in spades.
- Churchill?
- Yeah.
Except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
- Get some sleep, Élizabeth.
- Yes, sir.
Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We gotta go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened?
All right.
It's all right.
Find a holding area.
Start marshaling the survivors there.
The queen's chamber should be that way.
Hello?
You all right?
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right now.
Didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
Something you might've mentioned before she almost killed me.
- I only thought of it now.
- Colonel Sheppard.
So far we haven't run into a single Wraith, sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
- Go ahead.
- You can start sending people over.
They're all human and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.

Previously on Stargate Atlantis.
You're gonna need a name.
How does "Mike" sound?
The retrovirus works.
So much is clear.
Just look at the guy.
I'm returning to what I am.
Not only has our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith, but he's taken with him the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.
We have detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.
I think we can assume it's Michael.
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly?
Everything you've ever wanted to know about Wraith technology... but were afraid to ask.
Once we get in range, we can beam a canister into the CO2 chamber and boom!
One hive ship de-Wraithified.
There's been a change in plans.
There are two hive ships bearing down on our position, sir.
One of them is the friendly.
The Queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labor.
Within the hive ship's schematics was a worm-like computer virus.
What did they get?
The location of every world in our database.
With some 302s we might be able to take out the hyperdrive, save us some time.
Do it!
Shields are at 60%!
I've got incoming.
Daggers Three and Four, try to keep these Darts off our six.
Roger that.
Half the bogies are pursuing Daggers Three and Four.
We've got the other half hot on our tail.
I'm taking fire.
I've lost the generator.
Stand by to break left on my mark...
Mark!
Fox four!
We're in the clear.
Continue to target.
Shields are under 20%.
Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here as soon as possible.
Two minutes.
I can shut down their hyperdrives.
Unless you can shut down their weapons, it's not gonna do us much good.
Damn it!
Dagger Two, I could use some cover on my attack run to the target hyperdrive.
Roger that, leader.
I'm on my way.
The remaining Darts are returning to the hives.
Can you go to max thrust?
- Negative.
- Head back to the Daedalus.
Roger that.
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.
Why the hell'd they do that?
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.
- Sheppard?
- His fighter isn't one of them.
The only contacts I have on screen are wreckage.
What about his locator beacon?
Nothing, sir.
He's just gone.
Understood.
Okay.
This is new.
ATLANTIS 3x01 "NO MAN'S LAND" Subtitles subXpacio
Colonel Caldwell.
What's the status of the repairs?
Ongoing.
We lost a few key personnel in the attack.
Yes, we did.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
But this isn't the time to mourn them.
I just briefed General Landry.
We're to check-in in an hour and advise him of our response to this.
I've got a broken ship and serious casualties.
I don't know what sort of response you have in mind but...
- I want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me?
So long as they're still in striking distance, we have to at least try.
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.
Radek?
Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives... using the information they were able to steal from our database,
- ...the Aurora mission reports...
- Obviously.
However, the ships are organic in nature.
They will need to make brief pauses... to recover from the effects of hyperspace radiation.
- Where and when?
- Yeah.
It will take some time to calculate.
- Go.
- Okay.
Look, Dr. Weir, I wanna go after these bastards as much as you do, but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now.
Our shields are severely depleted, several decks are inaccessible.
Even if we could catch up with them, I don't know how long we'd last.
Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.
It was recalled the moment the Wraith computer virus was revealed.
And it's in no better shape than Daedalus!
It will fly, and by the time you reach the hive ships, it should also be able to fight.
And if it isn't?
Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels... capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth.
They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.
You know what you're asking me to do?
I do.
There's still repairs that need to be made.
Do what you have to do.
They couldn't have.
Even if they somehow deduced the location of Earth, they still wouldn't be able to get there, not unless they...
They downloaded something along with the hive ship plans.
Something like spyware.
It's like when I stupidly downloaded porn...
Music!
When I downloaded music!
It has to be...
I did this.
I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.
If anybody was going to do it, it'd be you.
Thank you!
Thank you so much for that!
Stop worrying about it now.
Just focus.
Focus on what?
What is there to focus on?
- I'm stuck in a cocoon!
- On getting out of here.
Oh, right, of course!
Why didn't I think of that?
Of course.
Here goes...
No, still can't move.
I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof there, big guy.
Okay.
Can't sit here forever.
Hit them while they're in hyperspace.
They'll never know what happened.
Is that even possible?
There is no reason to believe that their hyperspace field is any different than ours, and we can't launch 302s from the Daedalus while in hyperspace.
I'm simply talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it.
What do you think?
- Colonel?
- What?
Yes.
He's not listening.
I got to pay more attention to those guys.
Yes, Michael?
You should have told me... that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.
Are you feeling sympathy for them?
No.
But I don't understand why I wasn't told.
I told you of their plan because I believed it was a viable way...
You're only alive because you still may prove to be useful.
But I fear, Michael, that the lingering stench of what they have transformed you into will never fade.
In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace.
Here.
It's just outside of the Pegasus Galaxy.
There they will pause for 15 hours.
If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule, they should be able to reach those coordinates in just under 14 hours, best possible speed.
A narrow window.
It's the only window, sir.
Understood.
Now, the International Oversight Advisory wants you to brief them on this matter.
When would you like me to dial in again?
You misunderstand me.
I mean, in person, and I mean right now.
- The President himself assigned...
- I can't just leave, not now.
I'm afraid that's not up to you.
- There is far too much going on here...
- Doctor!
You've done all you're going to do for now.
I need you to step through that Gate.
They're waiting for you in my briefing room.
Dr. Weir?
I see.
Teyla, we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions.
Once that happens, I'd like to suspend all Gate travel...
- ...until this whole thing is over.
- Of course.
And I'll need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready to leave.
- I know what to do, Elizabeth.
- Of course you do.
- I will see you when you return.
- Thank you.
Welcome back to Earth.
Thank you, General.
It's wonderful to be here.
I can see that.
You know, I considered disobeying your order.
There wouldn't have been too much you could do about it.
You made the right decision in coming.
We're in the middle of a crisis, General.
This is absolutely...
Don't bite my head off, Elizabeth!
The recall order didn't come from me.
Who it came from doesn't matter.
What if I told you it came from the President?
- I wouldn't believe you.
- And you'd be right.
But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep... determined to feed on the human race.
The President had no choice but to accede to the IOA's demand... that you be brought back to explain yourself.
So what do they really want?
To point fingers and cover their asses.
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.
They're bureaucrats, Elizabeth.
You'll have them for breakfast.
There is work I must attend to.
Stand aside!
Am I to sit quietly in my quarters?
Now, you see, they're actually quite comfortable.
Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine.
I suppose they're as good a place as any... to witness the end of humanity as we know it.
You're wasting your energy talking.
Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down... and grants you one wish and we break out.
Then what, huh?
We're still in a hive.
We're still traveling through hyperspace, probably in the massive void between our two galaxies... where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.
What then, huh?
We fly home on the wings of imagination?
Is that what we do, Ronon?
You can sit here and die if you like, but I'm not giving up.
- Oh, fine!
I will.
- Fine!
Okay.
Time to do some damage.
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me?
Rodney, I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond.
If you're near a radio, I need you to come in.
I need to know your location.
Guys?
Colonel Sheppard.
Is that you?
Who's this?
You know me as Michael.
Sorry.
Got the wrong number.
Ronon and Dr. McKay are still alive.
What are you gonna do with them?
If you want them to live, listen to me.
If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships in order for them to reach us.
If you really want to help, why don't you just do that?
They would know.
Aren't you "they"?
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.
Oh, I don't know.
I was pretty deceived.
It seems, Colonel, that because of what you did to me, the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own.
Oh.
That's why you wanna help, because you don't feel welcome.
- We don't have time to discuss this.
- Sure we do.
I've got a good three hours of air left.
- Where are you?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
I need to know what level you're on so I can guide you from there.
You mean trust you?
Are you in a position not to?
Oh, I've got you right where I want you.
I doubt I'll be allowed to live much longer, and yet I very much want to continue living.
If you want to survive, as I do, then I suggest you tell me where you are.
I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship.
You still wanna help?
Target the ventral hyperdrive generators.
You'll be most effective.
Yeah.
That's what I was thinking.
Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.
The leader of the hive presented a scenario... which made it seem we were under a time constraint.
To speed up the problem-solving, we distributed the file...
And played right into their hands.
Yes.
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.
And we supported her recommendations, I know.
But clearly we were not in possession of all the facts.
Obviously, neither were we, Ambassador.
So what measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth?
I was coordinating a strike against the hive ships when you recalled me.
With what?
- With everything we've got.
Is that wise?
General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources... committed to fighting the Ori, the weapons platform in Antarctica, powered by a pair of Mark II generators, would be Earth's only defense.
Now, I believe it would be far better to stop them... while they're still within reach of Atlantis.
Wouldn't it have been more prudent... to send the ZPM back to Earth on the Daedalus, ensuring successful operation of the Antarctic weapons platform... when the Wraith arrive?
The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle.
A long journey at full power was out of the question.
And there is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.
You would risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships... in order to undo your mistake?
Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis performing emergency repairs.
There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard.
But either plan will require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.
Then, if you'll excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options.
I have instructed Atlantis to contact the SGC... when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
If you would like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go right ahead,
but you will have to fire me first.
Wonder what they'll do to us?
Feed on us, probably.
I mean, that's what they do.
- It's not gonna come to that.
- Maybe.
Earth'll probably mount some kind of defense, in which case I imagine death would be instantaneous.
Unless we're trapped on a deck with a fire or something, then we'd be burned alive.
Well, burned alive or suffocate.
I wonder which would be worse, being life-sucked by the Wraith or burned alive.
I honestly couldn't consider two worse options.
- Stop talking.
- Okay, you know what?
Make me!
What are you doing?
Where did you get that?
I was trying to get my hand free so I could get to it.
Would it have killed you to tell me?
Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.
What?
Don't just stand there, cut me loose!
Only if you put an end to all this, "We're gonna die, there's no hope" talk.
Well, now there is hope!
- Ready?
- No!
God, a little help, would you?
Oh!
Oh, it's freezing out here!
- Would you prefer to go back in?
- No!
- So now what?
- What?
- How do we get out of here?
- Well, I don't...
- What?
- You said no more death talk.
- McKay?
- Look, fine, we're out of the cocoons.
So what?
We're still stuck on the ship, and there's no way off it without...
- Well, any survivable way.
- You'll think of something.
- It's not a question of thinking...
- You'll think of something.
Fine.
Can we at least go somewhere else?
Can you get this off me?
- It's down my back!
It's down my back!
- Just...
So, what do they wanna do?
- They're still arguing about it.
- Of course they are!
Incoming wormhole.
This is Atlantis.
We have a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.
Stand by, Atlantis.
They haven't reached a decision.
And they don't want to, Mr. Woolsey, because if they agree or disagree with me, then they have to take some sort of responsibility.
No, they'd rather have someone to blame.
I give this order, either way they have a scapegoat if something goes wrong.
It's all part of the game.
Ma'am?
- Teyla?
- Yes, Elizabeth?
Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planned.
And Godspeed.
I will tell him.
Hermiod, what's our status?
Shields are at full strength.
I have rerouted all non-essential power... in order to ensure power levels for a longer period.
I want all operable missile tubes loaded with Mark III tactical warheads.
- That'd be every one of our nukes, sir.
- I'm well aware of that.
Secondly, I want to disable all firing safeties... to enable the launch of every one of our missiles... the moment we exit hyperspace.
I'm not even sure that's possible.
- Make it possible, please.
- Yes, sir.
Major Lorne, we're approaching our T-Zero.
Zelenka says she'll fly, sir, but as of right now, that's about all she can do.
You'll have 13 hours en route to get your weapons and shields online, but we need to leave right now to make this window.
Are you go or no go?
- We're go, sir.
- Very well.
On my mark.
Three, two, one, mark.
Are you sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area...
I'm about to light up?
I'm certain.
Good luck.
Thanks!
It'll be a walk in the park, a very scary park filled with monsters who are trying to kill me.
I don't understand.
- Never mind.
Operation "This Will Most Likely End Badly" is a go.
Target is destroyed.
Disable the second hive as quickly as possible.
Their fighters will already be headed your way.
Okay, how about some of this help you were talking about?
I told you, target the hyperdrive.
- I already knew that!
- There is nothing I can do.
Like hell there isn't!
Call off the Darts.
- They won't listen to me.
- This is not helpful, Michael!
- Dr. Weir.
- What can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey?
The ambassadors have finished convening.
Oh, good timing.
Yes, they'd like to continue debriefing you now.
Yeah, I bet they would.
- Excuse me?
- No.
I'm not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals... about every decision I've made these past two years... that they don't agree with in hindsight.
Dr. Weir, you know I have the greatest respect for you, but as far as the IOA is concerned, you're not exactly the employee of the month right now.
If the Wraith make it to Earth, then keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.
And if your plan succeeds?
Then I expect to keep my job, yes, because I did what they apparently are incapable of doing, I made a decision.
And the fact is, at this point, there really is nothing more we can do... but wait and see what happens.
But give them my best!
We have been walking around here for the better part of a day... and I haven't seen one exit sign.
Look, sooner or later, I'm gonna have to eat something.
- I think I have a plan.
- You?
Really?
- You know a lot about these ships, right?
- Oh, maybe.
Why?
If I can get you to a control panel, how much damage could you do?
- What do you mean?
- Could you overload the engines...
- ...and blow up the ship?
- How is that an escape plan?
- I never said it was an escape plan.
- Well, how is that a plan?
You're the one who says there's no way out of this.
If we're already dead, I say we take them with us.
I suppose I'd rather die as a hero than as a meal.
- So you can do it?
- Yeah, probably.
Now you're talking.
You should not be here.
She asked me to question the prisoner.
If you prefer to discuss it with her...
Release him.
I will take him from here.
You had me worried there.
You slowed them down, at least for a little while.
We need to get to a transport ship and hope your friends find us.
Not till we free Ronon and McKay.
We're headed toward them now.
Now, that's what I call help.
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.
Launch the moment the target is acquired.
Don't wait for my order.
Five, four, three...
Missiles are away.
- Dart activity?
- Quite a number of them, sir.
- They're moving to intercept our missiles.
- Now would be a good time, Orion.
What the hell?
One of your ships has launched an attack.
The first strike has done serious damage on this hive.
- Good!
- The other hive was undamaged.
Your vessel's continuing to engage.
Are we gonna go through the whole play-by-play, or are we gonna get out of here?
This way.
The ship's engaged in battle.
- With who?
- It doesn't matter.
- Well, it matters to us!
- Why?
Because if it's our guys, our chances of survival just went back above zero, albeit a fraction.
If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship... and help them win the battle.
Now, move it.
One missile got through, sir.
One of the Wraith ships suffered serious damage, but the other one is...
Sir, the Orion has arrived.
The other hive is moving to intercept.
- Did they launch their weapons?
- Negative, sir.
Open a secure channel.
Major Lorne, now would be a good time to open fire.
Yes, sir, I was just thinking the same thing.
I gave the order but nothing happened.
- Zelenka!
- I'm trying!
We're having a little difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons.
There's a hive bearing down on your position.
Yes, sir, I see that.
- Stand by.
Doc, you're killing us here.
- Okay.
I have it.
I have it.
I have it.
Firing drones!
Sir, the remaining hive is shifting their attack to the Orion.
- Move to intercept.
- Orion has no shields.
We're not gonna make it there in time, sir.
- Where are they?
- I'm sorry.
- They must have been taken for feeding.
- No, look.
These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.
- They could be anywhere on the ship.
- Well, that's a start.
Why?
What could their objective possibly be?
If I know Ronon, they're somewhere where they can do as much damage as they can.
McKay would know where and how to do that, so...
There's a control station this way.
One more shot, Zelenka, that's all I'm asking!
I just cannot give you what I don't have!
There's too much damage!
We need to abandon ship!
Hey, Doc!
Listen to me!
We sacrificed our shield capability for that first salvo!
This ship is going to blow any moment, Major!
Colonel Caldwell, I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our end.
Request immediate beam-out to Daedalus.
Get them over here!
Their operating system is a mess.
Thank goodness, I remembered DOS.
Trust me, that was hilarious.
Have you done it yet?
Okay, this ship has been seriously damaged.
It's hard for me to find something to overload.
Let Mikey try it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's helping us.
Where did you come from?
I managed to latch onto the hull of the hive before it went into hyperspace.
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.
We've got to get to the Daedalus.
- The Daedalus?
The Daedalus is here?
- First we need to get to the transport.
Now, why should I trust you?
Because I'm trusting you.
Because I said so.
- I don't like this.
- You got a better idea?
Yeah.
We take this ship on our own and leave him here.
He's the reason I'm alive right now.
Besides, I don't think that's even possible.
It took me days to crack the Wraith Dart interface,
- ...and this ship is a whole lot bigger.
- I don't like it.
- Yeah, I get it.
You hate the Wraith.
- Him in particular.
Is there anything you can do to boost a radio signal?
I wanna reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.
- Well, I can try.
- Hang on.
They'll most likely open fire on us the second we leave the bay.
Oh, great!
The day just gets better and better.
- Sorry, sir.
We did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for, Major.
Bring all railguns to bear on the main Dart bays.
Hold fire until I give the order.
Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then.
I have a contact, sir.
A single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.
It just left the hive and is on a course for us.
It's broadcasting a comm on our frequencies.
What the hell do they want?
- Maybe they want to surrender.
- Not likely.
Let's hear it.
This is Colonel John Sheppard.

Open a channel.
- Colonel Sheppard, we'd written you off.
- Don't get all emotional on me now!
Look, I've got McKay, Ronon and Michael aboard a Wraith transport.
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.
And he's got a plan I think you're gonna like.
But it probably won't be long before they start shooting at us.
Hive just opened fire on the transport, sir.
Beam them directly to the bridge.
Colonel.
Colonel, you said something about a plan?
I've disabled their jamming code, but it's only a matter of time before they realize.
All you have to do is send over a nuke.
We deployed all our warheads in the first attack.
The hive is launching Darts, sir.
Open up those bays, all batteries!
Cap that off!
- Report!
- The plan worked, sir.
The concentrated fire on the bays created a number of secondary explosions.
- They've stopped firing.
- Nice work, Colonel.
Fortunately, a draw's a win for our side.
Ship's status?
Shields completely depleted and we're venting atmosphere.
Seal off all affected decks.
Yes, sir, but that last blast took out our life support... and the backups aren't responding.
- As of right now, we're shallow breathing.
- Meaning?
Meaning that in a little under nine hours, we're all gonna suffocate.
As long as we don't have to worry about shields and weapons, we may be able to cannibalize parts from some of our other systems... in order to create at the very least a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we've got something like that up and running, the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers... we'd be able to concoct.
- But it's worth a try.
- Yes.
Yeah, but regardless, we need more electricians and welders... than are technically certified on this ship's roster.
Anyone, and I mean, anyone who took shop needs to report to us.
There are teams assembling on every deck.
Good.
Good.
Ah, now, we're talking.
- How many more of these do we have?
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard?
- In and around the 200 mark.
Oh, so I guess buddy-breathing our way through this one's out of the question.
- I'm afraid so, sir, yes.
- Okay, fine.
They're reserved for people working on getting life-support systems operational.
We need those people as clear-headed as possible.
- And, by those people...
- Yes, I will be one of them.
- How many levels are inaccessible?
- Seven.
Okay, we need to find out if there's any pockets... of breathable atmosphere in there.
We may be able to squeeze another hour or so... out of the regions that have been sealed off.
We can't exactly transfer the O2 where we need it.
Yes, but we could be...
Be able to access key panels that have been closed off to us.
Let's get Sheppard in a 302, he can eyeball it from the outside.
I'll take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an EVA?
The spacesuits were stored in those sections.
All right.
I'm heading back.
- Copy that.
Have you tried routing the power through the inertial...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications?
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send.
Even if we were somehow able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth, it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking simply of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith, and perhaps letting someone know the sacrifices we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only breathable air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
There's also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, Doctor.
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.
You will be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'll take my chances.
I admire your courage, Colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes!
That could work!
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it onboard?
- Yes, we do.
And now that Michael's disabled their jamming codes...
- We finish the plan we started!
- We beam over the gas and wait.
If we wait long enough, they won't even wanna put up a fight.
Because they'll be humans with no memories!
I can't believe we might actually survive this!
We're almost out of breathable air now, and the retrovirus takes a minimum 10 hours to run its course.
Well, we'll rotate the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship?
I could.
What do you say, Colonel?
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, sir.
Anything?
No.
No contacts yet.
Our tests of the Mark II generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.
"Promising."
That doesn't sound very promising.
We're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships, but doing so will probably require the last of our drones, and there goes our secret weapon.
They'd really rather not have to do that.
- How'd it go with the IOA?
- Oh, you know.
I mean, does anyone ever come out of an IOA deposition saying, "That went well"?
No, I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
At least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're gonna ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just gonna ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, General.
Yeah.
You did.
And I lost some of the best people I ever...
But you proceeded with the blessing of the IOA and Stargate Command, as I recall.
Somehow that doesn't seem to help much.
Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts.
And I think you've got that in spades.
- Churchill?
- Yeah.
Except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
- Get some sleep, Elizabeth.
- Yes, sir.
Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We've got to go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened?
All right.
It's all right.
Find a holding area, start marshalling the survivors there.
The Queen's chamber should be that way.
Hello?
You all right?
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right now.
It didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
Yeah.
Something you might have mentioned... before she almost killed me, Rodney.
I only thought of it now.
Colonel Sheppard.
So far we haven't run into a single Wraith, sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
Go ahead.
You can start sending people over, sir.
They're all human and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries
Previously on Stargate Atlantis :
Gonna need a name.
How does mike sound ?
The retrovirus works.
Just look at the guy.
- l'm returning to what I am.
- Our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith.
He's taken the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.
We've detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.
I think we can assume it's Michael.
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly ?
Everything you've wanted to know about Wraith technology.
Once we get in range, we beam a canister into the CO2 chamber and :
One hive ship de-Wraithified.
There's been a change in plans.
Two hive ships on our position.
One of them is the friendly.
The queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labor.
Within the ship's schematics was a worm-like computer virus.
What did they get ?
The location of every world in our database.
With 302s, we might take out the hyperdrive, save us some time.
Do it.
Shields are at 60 percent.
- I've got incoming.
- Daggers 3 and 4...
- ... try to keep these Darts off our six.
- Roger that.
Half the bogeys are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4.
We got the other half hot on our tail.
I'm taking fire. I've lost a generator.
Stand by to break left on my mark.
Mark.
Fox 4.
We're in the clear.
Continue to target.
Shields are under 20 percent.
Get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here.
Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.
Unless you can shut down their weapons it's not gonna do much good.
Damn it.
Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my attack run of the target.
Roger that, leader.
I'm on my way.
The Darts are returning to the hives.
Can you go to max thrust ?
Negative.
- Head back to the Daedalus.
- Roger that.
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.
Why the hell did they do that ?
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.
- Sheppard ?
- His fighter isn't one of them.
The only contacts I have on-screen are wreckage.
- What about his locator beacon ?
- Nothing, sir.
He's just gone.
Understood.
Okay, this is new.
Colonel Caldwell, what's the status of the repairs ?
Ongoing.
We lost a few key personnel in the attack.
Yes, we did.
I'm sorry.
So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them.
I've just briefed General Landry.
We're to check in and advise him of our response.
I've got a broken ship and casualties.
I don't know what you have in mind- l want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me ?
As long as they're still in striking distance we have to try.
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.
- Radek ?
- Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives using the information from our database.
- The Aurora mission.
- Obviously.
However, their ships are organic in nature.
They will need to make brief pauses to recover from hyperspace radiation.
- Where and when ?
- It will take some time to calculate.
- Go.
- Okay.
Dr. Weir, I wanna go after these bastards as much as you do but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now.
Our shields are depleted.
Several decks are inaccessible.
Even if we could catch up, I don't know how long we'd last.
Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.
It was recalled the moment the virus was revealed.
- It's in no better shape than Daedalus.
- It will fly.
And by the time you reach the hive ships it should also be able to fight.
- And if it isn't ?
- Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth.
They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.
You know what you're asking me to do ?
I do.
There's still repairs that need to be made.
Do what you have to do.
They couldn't have.
If they deduced the location of Earth they wouldn't be able to get there, unless they...
They downloaded something along with the hive-ship plans.
Something like spyware.
It's like when I stupidly downloaded por--
Music, when I downloaded music.
I asked them to do it.
I did this. I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.
Anybody was gonna do it, it'd be you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for that.
Stop worrying now.
Just focus.
On what ?
What is there to focus on ?
I'm stuck in a cocoon.
- Getting out of here.
- Right.
Of course.
Why didn't I think of that ?
Of course.
Here goes.
Nope, still can't move.
I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof there, big guy.
Okay, can't sit here forever.
Hit them while they're in hyperspace, they'Il never know what happened.
Is that even possible ?
There's no reason to believe their hyperspace field is different and we can't launch 302s while in hyperspace.
I'm talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it.
What do you think ?
- Colonel ?
- What ?
Yes.
He's not listening.
I gotta pay more attention to those guys.
Yes, Michael ?
You should have told me that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.
- Are you feeling sympathy for them ?
- No.
But I don't understand why I wasn't told.
I told you their plan because I believe it was a viable way--
You are only alive because you still may prove to be useful.
But I fear, Michael that the lingering stench of what they've transformed you into will never fade.
In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace here.
It's just outside of the Pegasus galaxy.
There they will pause for 15 hours.
If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule they should reach those coordinates in just under 14 hours, best possible speed.
Narrow window.
It's the only window, sir.
Understood.
Now, the International Oversight Advisory wants you to brief them on this matter.
- When would you like me to dial again ?
- You misunderstand me.
I mean in person, and I mean right now.
- The president himself is-- - l can't just leave.
Not now.
I'm afraid that's not up to you.
- There is far too much going on here.
- Doctor.
You've done all you're going to do for now.
I need you to step through that gate.
They're waiting for you in my briefing room.
Dr. Weir ?
I see.
Teyla, we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions.
Once that happens, I'd like to suspend gate travel till this is over.
Of course.
I'Il need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready.
I know what to do, Élizabeth.
Of course you do.
- l will see you when you return.
- Thank you.
Welcome back to Earth.
Thank you, general.
It's wonderful to be here.
I can see that.
You know, I considered disobeying your order.
There wouldn't have been too much you could do.
You made the right decision in coming.
We're in the middle of a crisis.
This is absolutely--
Don't bite my head off, Élizabeth.
The recall order didn't come from me.
Who it came from doesn't matter.
What if I told you it came from the president ?
I wouldn't believe you.
And you'd be right.
But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race.
The president had no choice but to accede to the I.
O.A.'s demand that you be brought back to explain.
So, what do they really want ?
To point fingers, cover their asses.
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.
They're bureaucrats, Élizabeth.
You'Il have them for breakfast.
There is work I must attend to.
Stand aside !
Am I to sit quietly in my quarters ?
You know, these are actually quite comfortable.
Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine.
They're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity.
You're wasting your energy talking.
Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out ?
Then what, huh ?
We're in a hive, traveling through hyperspace probably in the massive void between our two galaxies where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.
What then, huh ?
We fly home on the wings of imagination ?
- Is that what we do, Ronon ?
- You can sit here and die but I'm not giving up.
- Oh, fine. I will.
- Fine !
Okay, time to do some damage.
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me ?
Rodney ?
I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond.
If you're near a radio, I need you to come in.
I need to know your location.
Guys ?
Colonel Sheppard.
- Is that you ?
- Who's this ?
- You know me as Michael.
- Sorry, got the wrong number.
Ronon and Dr. mckay are still alive.
- What are you gonna do with them ?
- If you want them to live, listen to me.
If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships for them to reach us.
If you really wanna help, why don't you just do that ?
- They would know.
- Aren't you " they" ou " ?
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.
Oh, I don't know.
I was pretty deceived.
It seems that because of what you did to me the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own.
That's why you wanna help, because you don't feel welcome.
- We don't have time to discuss this.
- Sure we do.
I've got a good three hours of air left.
- Where are you ?
- Wouldn't you like to know ?
I need to know what level you're on so I can guide you from there.
You mean trust you ?
Are you in a position not to ?
I've got you right where l want you.
I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer and yet I very much want to continue living.
If you want to survive as I do then I suggest you tell me where you are.
I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship.
You still wanna help ?
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive would be most effective.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.
The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we were under a time constraint.
To speed up the problem solving, we distributed the file.
And played right into their hands.
Yes.
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.
And we supported her recommendations, I know.
But clearly, we were not in possession of all of the facts.
Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.
What measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth ?
I was coordinating a strike when you recalled me.
With what ?
- With everything we've got.
- Is that wise ?
General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori the weapons platform in Antarctica powered by a pair of Mark-ll generators would be Earth's only defense.
I believe it would be better to stop them while they're within reach of Atlantis.
Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM back to Earth on the Daedalus ensuring successful operation of the weapons platform when the Wraith arrive ?
The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle.
A long journey at full power was out of the question.
There is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.
You'd risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to undo your mistake ?
Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs.
There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard.
But either plan will require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.
Then if you'Il excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options.
I have instructed Atlantis to contact the SGC when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
If you'd like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go ahead.
But you will have to fire me first.
Wonder what they'Il do to us.
Feed on us probably.
I mean, that's...
That's what they do.
It's not gonna come to that.
Maybe.
Earth will probably mount some kind of defense.
In which case, death would be instantaneous.
Unless we're trapped on a deck with a fire or something.
Then we'd be burned alive.
Well, burned alive or suffocate.
I wonder which would be worse :
Being life-sucked by the Wraith, or burned alive.
I couldn't consider two worse options.
- Stop talking.
- Okay, you know what ?
Make me.
What are you doing ?
Where did you get that ?
I was trying to get my hand free so I could get it.
Would it have killed you to tell me ?
Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.
What ?
Don't just stand there.
Cut me loose.
Only if you put an end to all this " we're gonna die, there's no hope " talk.
Well, now there's hope.
Get ready.
A little help with this ?
- It's freezing out here.
- Would you prefer to go back in ?
- No.
- So now what ?
- What ?
- How do we get out of here ?
- Well, I don't--
- What ?
- You said no more death talk.
- Okay.
We're out of the cocoons.
So what ?
We're still on the ship.
There's no way off it.
- Well, any survivable way.
- You'Il think of something.
- It's not a question of thinking.
- You'Il think of something.
Fine.
Can we at least go somewhere else ?
Can you get this off me ?
It's down my back.
It's down my back.
Just...
So, what do they wanna do ?
They're still arguing about it.
- Of course they are.
- Incoming wormhole.
This is Atlantis.
We have a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.
Stand by, Atlantis.
They haven't reached a decision.
And they don't want to, Mr. Woolsey.
If they agree or disagree with me, then they have to take some responsibility.
They'd rather have someone to blame.
I give this order either way, they have a scapegoat.
It's all part of the game.
Ma'am ?
Teyla.
Yes, Élizabeth.
Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planned...
- ... and Godspeed.
- I will tell him.
Hermiod, what's our status ?
Shields are at full strength.
I've rerouted nonessential power in order to ensure power levels for a longer period.
I want all missile tubes loaded with Mark-lll tactical warheads.
- That would be every one.
- l'm aware of that.
Disable all firing safeties to launch every one of our missiles...
- ... the moment we exit hyperspace.
- l'm not sure that's possible.
- Make it possible, please.
- Yes, sir.
major Lorne, we're approaching our T-zero.
Zelenka says she'Il fly, sir, but as of right now that's about all she can do.
You'Il have 13 hours to get your weapons and shields online.
We need to leave now to make this window.
Are you go or no-go ?
We're a go, sir.
Very well.
On my mark :
Three, two, one, mark.
You sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area I'm about to light up ?
I'm certain.
Good luck.
Thanks.
It'Il be a walk in the park.
A very scary park filled with monsters who are trying to kill me.
- I don't understand.
- Never mind.
Operation This-Will-Most-Likely-End-Badly is a go.
Target is destroyed.
Disable the second hive quickly.
Their fighters will be headed your way.
How about this help you were talking about ?
- I told you, target the hyperdrive.
- l already knew that.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Like hell there isn't.
Call off the Darts.
They won't listen to me.
This is not helpful, Michael.
Dr. Weir ?
What can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey ?
The ambassadors have finished convening.
Oh, good timing.
Yes.
They'd like to continue debriefing you now.
- Yeah, I bet they would.
- Excuse me ?
No. I'm not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals about every decision I've made that they don't agree with in hindsight.
I have the greatest respect for you but as far as the I.
O.A. is concerned you're not exactly the employee of the month.
If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.
- And if your plan succeeds ?
- Then I expect to keep my job, yes.
Because I did what they apparently are incapable of doing. I made a decision.
The fact is, at this point, there is nothing more we can do but wait and see what happens.
But give them my best.
We have been walking around here for a day and I haven't seen one exit sign.
Sooner or later, I'Il have to eat something.
- l think I have a plan.
- You ?
Really ?
- You know a lot about these ships, right ?
- Maybe.
Why ?
If I get you to a panel, how much damage could you do ?
- What ?
- Overload the engines and blow the ship ?
- How is that an escape plan ?
- l never said it was.
- That's a plan ?
- You said there's no way out.
- If we're dead, let's take them with us.
- l'd rather die a hero than a meal.
- You can do it ?
- Yeah, probably.
Now you're talking.
You should not be here.
She asked me to question the prisoner.
If you'd prefer to discuss it with her...
Release him.
I will take him from here.
You had me worried there.
You've slowed them down, at least for a little while.
We need to get to a ship, hope your friends find us.
Not till we free Ronon and McKay.
We're headed toward them now.
Now, that's what I call help.
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.
Launch the moment the target's acquired.
Don't wait.
Five, four, three--
- Missiles are away.
- Dart activity ?
Quite a number of them.
They're moving to intercept our missiles.
Now would be a good time, Orion.
What the hell ?
One of your ships has launched an attack.
Their strike inflicted damage on this hive.
Good.
The other was undamaged.
Your vessel's continuing to engage.
Are you gonna go through the play-by-play or get out of here ?
This way.
- Ship's engaged in battle.
- With who ?
- Doesn't matter.
- Matters to us.
- Why ?
- If it's our guys our chance went back above zero, fractionally.
If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help them.
Move it.
One missile got through, sir.
One of the Wraith ships suffered damage but the other one--
The Orion has arrived.
The hive is moving to intercept.
- They launched their weapons ?
- Negative, sir.
Open a secure channel.
major Lorne, now would be a good time to open fire.
Yes, I was thinking the same.
I gave the order, but nothing happened.
Zelenka ?
I'm trying !
We're having difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons.
- There's a hive bearing on your position.
- Yes, sir.
I see.
- Stand by.
Doc, you're killing us.
- Okay. I have it.
Firing drones.
The remaining hive is shifting their attack to Orion.
Move to intercept.
Orion has no shields.
We're not gonna make it there in time, sir.
Where are they ?
I'm sorry.
They must have been taken for feeding.
No, no.
These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.
They could be anywhere on this ship.
Well, that's a start.
Why ?
What could their objective possibly be ?
If I know Ronon, they're somewhere they can do much damage.
And McKay would know where and how to do that, so...
There's a control station this way.
One more shot, that's all I'm asking.
I just cannot give you what I don't have.
There's too much damage.
We need to abandon ship.
- Listen to me.
- We sacrificed our shield capability for that first salvo.
This ship is going to blow any moment, major.
Caldwell, I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our end.
Request immediate beam out to Daedalus.
Get them over here.
Their operating system is a mess.
Thank goodness I remember DOS.
- Trust me, that was hilarious.
- Have you done it yet ?
Look, this ship has been seriously damaged.
It's hard for me to find something to overload.
Let Mikey try.
- He's helping us.
- Where did you come from ?
I latched onto the hull before it went into hyperspace.
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.
- We gotta get to the Daedalus.
- The Daedalus is here ?
- We need to get to the transport.
- Why should I trust you ?
Because I'm trusting you.
Because I said so.
- l don't like this.
- You got a better idea ?
We take the ship on our own and leave him here.
He's the reason I'm alive now.
I don't think that's possible.
It took days to crack the Dart interface.
- This ship is bigger.
- l don't like it.
- Yeah, I get it.
You hate the Wraith.
- Him in particular.
Is there anything to boost a signal ?
I wanna reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.
- Well, I could try.
- Hang on.
They'Il open fire on us the second we leave the bay.
Oh, great.
The day just gets better and better.
- Sorry, sir.
We did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for.
Bring guns to bear on the Dart bays.
Hold fire till I order.
Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then.
I have a contact.
Single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.
Just left the hive and is on a course for us.
- It's broadcasting on our frequencies.
- What do they want ?
- Maybe they want to surrender ?
- Not likely.
Let's hear it.
This is Sheppard, authentication code Alpha-Seven-Tango-Three.
Please respond.

Colonel Sheppard, we'd written you off.
Don't get all emotional on me now.
I've got mckay, Ronon and michael aboard a Wraith transport.
- Michael ?
- Yes, sir.
He's got a plan you'Il like.
It won't be long before they start shooting at us.
- The hive opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.
- Colonel.
- You said something about a plan ?
I've disabled their jamming code.
It's a matter of time before they realize.
- All you have to do is send a nuke.
- We deployed all our warheads.
- The hive is launching Darts.
- Open up on those bays, all batteries.
Shut that off !
- Report.
- The plan worked, sir.
The concentrated fire on the bays created secondary explosions.
- They've stopped firing.
- Nice work, colonel.
A draw is a win for our side.
Ship status ?
Shields completely depleted.
We're venting atmosphere.
Seal off all affected decks.
That last blast took out life support.
The backups aren't responding.
Right now, we're shallow-breathing.
- Meaning ?
- Meaning that in under nine hours we're all gonna suffocate.
As long as we don't worry about shields and weapons we may be able to cannibalize parts from other systems in order to create a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we got that up and running the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we concoct.
- But it's worth a try.
- Yes, but regardless we need more electricians and welders than are certified on this ship.
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.
- Teams assembling on every deck.
- Good, good.
Now we're talking.
How many more of these do we have ?
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard ?
In and around the 200 mark.
Buddy-breathing our way through is out of the question.
- l'm afraid so, sir.
Yes.
- Okay, fine.
They're for people working on life support.
- We need those people clear-headed.
- By " those people" ou " ?
-- ?
- l'Il be one.
- How many levels inaccessible ?
- Seven.
- We need to find out if there's pockets of atmosphere.
We may squeeze another hour...
- ... from the regions sealed off.
- We can't transfer the O2...
- ... where we need.
- We could--
We'Il be able to access panels closed off.
Get Sheppard in a 302.
He can eyeball it from the outside.
I'Il take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an EVA ?
Space suits were stored in those sections.
- All right, I'm heading back.
- Copy that.
Have you tried routing from the inertial-- ?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications ?
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send.
Even if we were able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith.
Letting someone know the sacrifice we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
There's also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor.
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.
You would be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'Il take my chances.
I admire your courage, colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes.
That could work.
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it onboard ?
- Yes, we do.
Michael's disabled their jamming codes--
- We finish the plan we started.
- We beam over the gas and wait.
We wait long enough, they won't wanna put up a fight.
They'Il be humans with no memories.
I might actually survive this.
We're almost out of air.
The retrovirus takes 10 hours to run its course.
Yeah, well, we'Il rotate the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship ?
I could.
What do you say, colonel ?
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, sir.
- Anything ?
- No.
No contacts yet.
Our tests of the Mark-ll generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.
" Promising. " That doesn't sound very promising.
We're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships but doing so will probably require the last of our drones and there goes our secret weapon.
We'd really rather not have to do that.
How'd it go with the I.
O. A ?
Oh, you know.
I mean, does anyone ever come out of an I.
O.A. deposition saying :
" That went well" ou " ?
No, I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
At least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're gonna ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just gonna ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, general.
Yeah, you did.
I lost some of the best people--
You proceeded with the blessing of the I.
O.A.
And Stargate Command, as I recall.
Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.
Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts.
And I think you've got that in spades.
- Churchill ?
- Yeah.
Except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
- Get some sleep, Élizabeth.
- Yes, sir.
Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We gotta go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened ?
All right.
It's all right.
Find a holding area.
Start marshaling the survivors there.
The queen's chamber should be that way.
Hello ?
You all right ?
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right now.
Didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
Something you might've mentioned before she almost killed me.
- l only thought of it now.
- Colonel Sheppard.
So far we haven't run into a single Wraith, sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
- Go ahead.
- You can start sending people over.
They're all human and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.

Previously on Stargate Atlantis :
Gonna need a name.
How does mike sound ?
The retrovirus works.
Just look at the guy.
- l'm returning to what I am.
- Our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith.
He's taken the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.
We've detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.
I think we can assume it's Michael.
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly ?
Everything you've wanted to know about Wraith technology.
Once we get in range, we beam a canister into the CO2 chamber and :
One hive ship de-Wraithified.
There's been a change in plans.
Two hive ships on our position.
One of them is the friendly.
The queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labor.
Within the ship's schematics was a worm-like computer virus.
What did they get ?
The location of every world in our database.
With 302s, we might take out the hyperdrive, save us some time.
Do it.
Shields are at 60 percent.
- I've got incoming.
- Daggers 3 and 4...
- ... try to keep these Darts off our six.
- Roger that.
Half the bogeys are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4.
We got the other half hot on our tail.
I'm taking fire. I've lost a generator.
Stand by to break left on my mark.
Mark.
Fox 4.
We're in the clear.
Continue to target.
Shields are under 20 percent.
Get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here.
Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.
Unless you can shut down their weapons it's not gonna do much good.
Damn it.
Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my attack run of the target.
Roger that, leader.
I'm on my way.
The Darts are returning to the hives.
Can you go to max thrust ?
Negative.
- Head back to the Daedalus.
- Roger that.
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.
Why the hell did they do that ?
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.
- Sheppard ?
- His fighter isn't one of them.
The only contacts I have on-screen are wreckage.
- What about his locator beacon ?
- Nothing, sir.
He's just gone.
Understood.
Okay, this is new.
Colonel Caldwell, what's the status of the repairs ?
Ongoing.
We lost a few key personnel in the attack.
Yes, we did.
I'm sorry.
So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them.
I've just briefed General Landry.
We're to check in and advise him of our response.
I've got a broken ship and casualties.
I don't know what you have in mind- l want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me ?
As long as they're still in striking distance we have to try.
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.
- Radek ?
- Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives using the information from our database.
- The Aurora mission.
- Obviously.
However, their ships are organic in nature.
They will need to make brief pauses to recover from hyperspace radiation.
- Where and when ?
- It will take some time to calculate.
- Go.
- Okay.
Dr. Weir, I wanna go after these bastards as much as you do but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now.
Our shields are depleted.
Several decks are inaccessible.
Even if we could catch up, I don't know how long we'd last.
Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.
It was recalled the moment the virus was revealed.
- It's in no better shape than Daedalus.
- It will fly.
And by the time you reach the hive ships it should also be able to fight.
- And if it isn't ?
- Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth.
They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.
You know what you're asking me to do ?
I do.
There's still repairs that need to be made.
Do what you have to do.
They couldn't have.
If they deduced the location of Earth they wouldn't be able to get there, unless they...
They downloaded something along with the hive-ship plans.
Something like spyware.
It's like when I stupidly downloaded por--
Music, when I downloaded music.
I asked them to do it.
I did this. I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.
Anybody was gonna do it, it'd be you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for that.
Stop worrying now.
Just focus.
On what ?
What is there to focus on ?
I'm stuck in a cocoon.
- Getting out of here.
- Right.
Of course.
Why didn't I think of that ?
Of course.
Here goes.
Nope, still can't move.
I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof there, big guy.
Okay, can't sit here forever.
Hit them while they're in hyperspace, they'Il never know what happened.
Is that even possible ?
There's no reason to believe their hyperspace field is different and we can't launch 302s while in hyperspace.
I'm talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it.
What do you think ?
- Colonel ?
- What ?
Yes.
He's not listening.
I gotta pay more attention to those guys.
Yes, Michael ?
You should have told me that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.
- Are you feeling sympathy for them ?
- No.
But I don't understand why I wasn't told.
I told you their plan because I believe it was a viable way--
You are only alive because you still may prove to be useful.
But I fear, Michael that the lingering stench of what they've transformed you into will never fade.
In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace here.
It's just outside of the Pegasus galaxy.
There they will pause for 15 hours.
If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule they should reach those coordinates in just under 14 hours, best possible speed.
Narrow window.
It's the only window, sir.
Understood.
Now, the International Oversight Advisory wants you to brief them on this matter.
- When would you like me to dial again ?
- You misunderstand me.
I mean in person, and I mean right now.
- The president himself is-- - l can't just leave.
Not now.
I'm afraid that's not up to you.
- There is far too much going on here.
- Doctor.
You've done all you're going to do for now.
I need you to step through that gate.
They're waiting for you in my briefing room.
Dr. Weir ?
I see.
Teyla, we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions.
Once that happens, I'd like to suspend gate travel till this is over.
Of course.
I'Il need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready.
I know what to do, Élizabeth.
Of course you do.
- l will see you when you return.
- Thank you.
Welcome back to Earth.
Thank you, general.
It's wonderful to be here.
I can see that.
You know, I considered disobeying your order.
There wouldn't have been too much you could do.
You made the right decision in coming.
We're in the middle of a crisis.
This is absolutely--
Don't bite my head off, Élizabeth.
The recall order didn't come from me.
Who it came from doesn't matter.
What if I told you it came from the president ?
I wouldn't believe you.
And you'd be right.
But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race.
The president had no choice but to accede to the I.
O.A.'s demand that you be brought back to explain.
So, what do they really want ?
To point fingers, cover their asses.
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.
They're bureaucrats, Élizabeth.
You'Il have them for breakfast.
There is work I must attend to.
Stand aside !
Am I to sit quietly in my quarters ?
You know, these are actually quite comfortable.
Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine.
They're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity.
You're wasting your energy talking.
Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out ?
Then what, huh ?
We're in a hive, traveling through hyperspace probably in the massive void between our two galaxies where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.
What then, huh ?
We fly home on the wings of imagination ?
- Is that what we do, Ronon ?
- You can sit here and die but I'm not giving up.
- Oh, fine. I will.
- Fine !
Okay, time to do some damage.
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me ?
Rodney ?
I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond.
If you're near a radio, I need you to come in.
I need to know your location.
Guys ?
Colonel Sheppard.
- Is that you ?
- Who's this ?
- You know me as Michael.
- Sorry, got the wrong number.
Ronon and Dr. mckay are still alive.
- What are you gonna do with them ?
- If you want them to live, listen to me.
If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships for them to reach us.
If you really wanna help, why don't you just do that ?
- They would know.
- Aren't you " they" ou " ?
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.
Oh, I don't know.
I was pretty deceived.
It seems that because of what you did to me the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own.
That's why you wanna help, because you don't feel welcome.
- We don't have time to discuss this.
- Sure we do.
I've got a good three hours of air left.
- Where are you ?
- Wouldn't you like to know ?
I need to know what level you're on so I can guide you from there.
You mean trust you ?
Are you in a position not to ?
I've got you right where l want you.
I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer and yet I very much want to continue living.
If you want to survive as I do then I suggest you tell me where you are.
I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship.
You still wanna help ?
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive would be most effective.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.
The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we were under a time constraint.
To speed up the problem solving, we distributed the file.
And played right into their hands.
Yes.
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.
And we supported her recommendations, I know.
But clearly, we were not in possession of all of the facts.
Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.
What measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth ?
I was coordinating a strike when you recalled me.
With what ?
- With everything we've got.
- Is that wise ?
General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori the weapons platform in Antarctica powered by a pair of Mark-ll generators would be Earth's only defense.
I believe it would be better to stop them while they're within reach of Atlantis.
Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM back to Earth on the Daedalus ensuring successful operation of the weapons platform when the Wraith arrive ?
The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle.
A long journey at full power was out of the question.
There is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.
You'd risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to undo your mistake ?
Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs.
There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard.
But either plan will require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.
Then if you'Il excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options.
I have instructed Atlantis to contact the SGC when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
If you'd like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go ahead.
But you will have to fire me first.
Wonder what they'Il do to us.
Feed on us probably.
I mean, that's...
That's what they do.
It's not gonna come to that.
Maybe.
Earth will probably mount some kind of defense.
In which case, death would be instantaneous.
Unless we're trapped on a deck with a fire or something.
Then we'd be burned alive.
Well, burned alive or suffocate.
I wonder which would be worse :
Being life-sucked by the Wraith, or burned alive.
I couldn't consider two worse options.
- Stop talking.
- Okay, you know what ?
Make me.
What are you doing ?
Where did you get that ?
I was trying to get my hand free so I could get it.
Would it have killed you to tell me ?
Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.
What ?
Don't just stand there.
Cut me loose.
Only if you put an end to all this " we're gonna die, there's no hope " talk.
Well, now there's hope.
Get ready.
A little help with this ?
- It's freezing out here.
- Would you prefer to go back in ?
- No.
- So now what ?
- What ?
- How do we get out of here ?
- Well, I don't--
- What ?
- You said no more death talk.
- Okay.
We're out of the cocoons.
So what ?
We're still on the ship.
There's no way off it.
- Well, any survivable way.
- You'Il think of something.
- It's not a question of thinking.
- You'Il think of something.
Fine.
Can we at least go somewhere else ?
Can you get this off me ?
It's down my back.
It's down my back.
Just...
So, what do they wanna do ?
They're still arguing about it.
- Of course they are.
- Incoming wormhole.
This is Atlantis.
We have a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.
Stand by, Atlantis.
They haven't reached a decision.
And they don't want to, Mr. Woolsey.
If they agree or disagree with me, then they have to take some responsibility.
They'd rather have someone to blame.
I give this order either way, they have a scapegoat.
It's all part of the game.
Ma'am ?
Teyla.
Yes, Élizabeth.
Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planned...
- ... and Godspeed.
- I will tell him.
Hermiod, what's our status ?
Shields are at full strength.
I've rerouted nonessential power in order to ensure power levels for a longer period.
I want all missile tubes loaded with Mark-lll tactical warheads.
- That would be every one.
- l'm aware of that.
Disable all firing safeties to launch every one of our missiles...
- ... the moment we exit hyperspace.
- l'm not sure that's possible.
- Make it possible, please.
- Yes, sir.
major Lorne, we're approaching our T-zero.
Zelenka says she'Il fly, sir, but as of right now that's about all she can do.
You'Il have 13 hours to get your weapons and shields online.
We need to leave now to make this window.
Are you go or no-go ?
We're a go, sir.
Very well.
On my mark :
Three, two, one, mark.
You sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area I'm about to light up ?
I'm certain.
Good luck.
Thanks.
It'Il be a walk in the park.
A very scary park filled with monsters who are trying to kill me.
- I don't understand.
- Never mind.
Operation This-Will-Most-Likely-End-Badly is a go.
Target is destroyed.
Disable the second hive quickly.
Their fighters will be headed your way.
How about this help you were talking about ?
- I told you, target the hyperdrive.
- l already knew that.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Like hell there isn't.
Call off the Darts.
They won't listen to me.
This is not helpful, Michael.
Dr. Weir ?
What can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey ?
The ambassadors have finished convening.
Oh, good timing.
Yes.
They'd like to continue debriefing you now.
- Yeah, I bet they would.
- Excuse me ?
No. I'm not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals about every decision I've made that they don't agree with in hindsight.
I have the greatest respect for you but as far as the I.
O.A. is concerned you're not exactly the employee of the month.
If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.
- And if your plan succeeds ?
- Then I expect to keep my job, yes.
Because I did what they apparently are incapable of doing. I made a decision.
The fact is, at this point, there is nothing more we can do but wait and see what happens.
But give them my best.
We have been walking around here for a day and I haven't seen one exit sign.
Sooner or later, I'Il have to eat something.
- l think I have a plan.
- You ?
Really ?
- You know a lot about these ships, right ?
- Maybe.
Why ?
If I get you to a panel, how much damage could you do ?
- What ?
- Overload the engines and blow the ship ?
- How is that an escape plan ?
- l never said it was.
- That's a plan ?
- You said there's no way out.
- If we're dead, let's take them with us.
- l'd rather die a hero than a meal.
- You can do it ?
- Yeah, probably.
Now you're talking.
You should not be here.
She asked me to question the prisoner.
If you'd prefer to discuss it with her...
Release him.
I will take him from here.
You had me worried there.
You've slowed them down, at least for a little while.
We need to get to a ship, hope your friends find us.
Not till we free Ronon and McKay.
We're headed toward them now.
Now, that's what I call help.
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.
Launch the moment the target's acquired.
Don't wait.
Five, four, three--
- Missiles are away.
- Dart activity ?
Quite a number of them.
They're moving to intercept our missiles.
Now would be a good time, Orion.
What the hell ?
One of your ships has launched an attack.
Their strike inflicted damage on this hive.
Good.
The other was undamaged.
Your vessel's continuing to engage.
Are you gonna go through the play-by-play or get out of here ?
This way.
- Ship's engaged in battle.
- With who ?
- Doesn't matter.
- Matters to us.
- Why ?
- If it's our guys our chance went back above zero, fractionally.
If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help them.
Move it.
One missile got through, sir.
One of the Wraith ships suffered damage but the other one--
The Orion has arrived.
The hive is moving to intercept.
- They launched their weapons ?
- Negative, sir.
Open a secure channel.
major Lorne, now would be a good time to open fire.
Yes, I was thinking the same.
I gave the order, but nothing happened.
Zelenka ?
I'm trying !
We're having difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons.
- There's a hive bearing on your position.
- Yes, sir.
I see.
- Stand by.
Doc, you're killing us.
- Okay. I have it.
Firing drones.
The remaining hive is shifting their attack to Orion.
Move to intercept.
Orion has no shields.
We're not gonna make it there in time, sir.
Where are they ?
I'm sorry.
They must have been taken for feeding.
No, no.
These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.
They could be anywhere on this ship.
Well, that's a start.
Why ?
What could their objective possibly be ?
If I know Ronon, they're somewhere they can do much damage.
And McKay would know where and how to do that, so...
There's a control station this way.
One more shot, that's all I'm asking.
I just cannot give you what I don't have.
There's too much damage.
We need to abandon ship.
- Listen to me.
- We sacrificed our shield capability for that first salvo.
This ship is going to blow any moment, major.
Caldwell, I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our end.
Request immediate beam out to Daedalus.
Get them over here.
Their operating system is a mess.
Thank goodness I remember DOS.
- Trust me, that was hilarious.
- Have you done it yet ?
Look, this ship has been seriously damaged.
It's hard for me to find something to overload.
Let Mikey try.
- He's helping us.
- Where did you come from ?
I latched onto the hull before it went into hyperspace.
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.
- We gotta get to the Daedalus.
- The Daedalus is here ?
- We need to get to the transport.
- Why should I trust you ?
Because I'm trusting you.
Because I said so.
- l don't like this.
- You got a better idea ?
We take the ship on our own and leave him here.
He's the reason I'm alive now.
I don't think that's possible.
It took days to crack the Dart interface.
- This ship is bigger.
- l don't like it.
- Yeah, I get it.
You hate the Wraith.
- Him in particular.
Is there anything to boost a signal ?
I wanna reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.
- Well, I could try.
- Hang on.
They'Il open fire on us the second we leave the bay.
Oh, great.
The day just gets better and better.
- Sorry, sir.
We did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for.
Bring guns to bear on the Dart bays.
Hold fire till I order.
Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then.
I have a contact.
Single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.
Just left the hive and is on a course for us.
- It's broadcasting on our frequencies.
- What do they want ?
- Maybe they want to surrender ?
- Not likely.
Let's hear it.
This is Sheppard, authentication code Alpha-Seven-Tango-Three.
Please respond.
Open a channel.
Colonel Sheppard, we'd written you off.
Don't get all emotional on me now.
I've got mckay, Ronon and michael aboard a Wraith transport.
- Michael ?
- Yes, sir.
He's got a plan you'Il like.
It won't be long before they start shooting at us.
- The hive opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.
- Colonel.
- You said something about a plan ?
I've disabled their jamming code.
It's a matter of time before they realize.
- All you have to do is send a nuke.
- We deployed all our warheads.
- The hive is launching Darts.
- Open up on those bays, all batteries.
Shut that off !
- Report.
- The plan worked, sir.
The concentrated fire on the bays created secondary explosions.
- They've stopped firing.
- Nice work, colonel.
A draw is a win for our side.
Ship status ?
Shields completely depleted.
We're venting atmosphere.
Seal off all affected decks.
That last blast took out life support.
The backups aren't responding.
Right now, we're shallow-breathing.
- Meaning ?
- Meaning that in under nine hours we're all gonna suffocate.
As long as we don't worry about shields and weapons we may be able to cannibalize parts from other systems in order to create a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we got that up and running the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we concoct.
- But it's worth a try.
- Yes, but regardless we need more electricians and welders than are certified on this ship.
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.
- Teams assembling on every deck.
- Good, good.
Now we're talking.
How many more of these do we have ?
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard ?
In and around the 200 mark.
Buddy-breathing our way through is out of the question.
- l'm afraid so, sir.
Yes.
- Okay, fine.
They're for people working on life support.
- We need those people clear-headed.
- By " those people" ou " ?
-- ?
- l'Il be one.
- How many levels inaccessible ?
- Seven.
- We need to find out if there's pockets of atmosphere.
We may squeeze another hour...
- ... from the regions sealed off.
- We can't transfer the O2...
- ... where we need.
- We could--
We'Il be able to access panels closed off.
Get Sheppard in a 302.
He can eyeball it from the outside.
I'Il take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an EVA ?
Space suits were stored in those sections.
- All right, I'm heading back.
- Copy that.
Have you tried routing from the inertial-- ?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications ?
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send.
Even if we were able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith.
Letting someone know the sacrifice we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
There's also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor.
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.
You would be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'Il take my chances.
I admire your courage, colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes.
That could work.
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it onboard ?
- Yes, we do.
Michael's disabled their jamming codes--
- We finish the plan we started.
- We beam over the gas and wait.
We wait long enough, they won't wanna put up a fight.
They'Il be humans with no memories.
I might actually survive this.
We're almost out of air.
The retrovirus takes 10 hours to run its course.
Yeah, well, we'Il rotate the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship ?
I could.
What do you say, colonel ?
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, sir.
- Anything ?
- No.
No contacts yet.
Our tests of the Mark-ll generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.
" Promising. " That doesn't sound very promising.
We're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships but doing so will probably require the last of our drones and there goes our secret weapon.
We'd really rather not have to do that.
How'd it go with the I.
O. A ?
Oh, you know.
I mean, does anyone ever come out of an I.
O.A. deposition saying :
" That went well" ou " ?
No, I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
At least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're gonna ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just gonna ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, general.
Yeah, you did.
I lost some of the best people--
You proceeded with the blessing of the I.
O.A.
And Stargate Command, as I recall.
Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.
Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts.
And I think you've got that in spades.
- Churchill ?
- Yeah.
Except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
- Get some sleep, Élizabeth.
- Yes, sir.
Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We gotta go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened ?
All right.
It's all right.
Find a holding area.
Start marshaling the survivors there.
The queen's chamber should be that way.
Hello ?
You all right ?
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right now.
Didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
Something you might've mentioned before she almost killed me.
- l only thought of it now.
- Colonel Sheppard.
So far we haven't run into a single Wraith, sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
- Go ahead.
- You can start sending people over.
They're all human and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.
[ENGLISH]
Previously on stargate Atlantis... you're going to need a name.
How does "mike" sound?
The retrovirus works.
Just look at the guy.
I'm returning to what...
I... am.
Not only has our dear lieutenant rejoined the wraith, but he's taken with him the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.
We have detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.
I think we can assume it's Michael.
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy wraith.
Receiving transmission.
What is, exactly?
Everything you've ever wanted to know about wraith technology but were afraid to ask.
Once we get in range, we can beam a canister into the CO2 chamber, and boom, one hive ship de-wraith-ified.
There's been a... change in plans.
Two hive ships bearing down on our position, sir.
One of them is the friendly.
The queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labor.
Within the hive ship's schematics was a worm-like computer virus.
What did they get?
The location of every world in our database.
- With some 302s, save us some time.
- Do it.
Shields are at 60%!
I've got incoming.
- Dagger 3 and 4, try to keep these darts off our six.
- Roger that.
Half the bogies are pursuing daggers 3 and 4.
We've got the other half hot on our tail.
I'm taking fire.
I've lost a generator.
Stand by to break left on my mark.
Mark!
Fox 4.
We're in the clear.
Continue to target.
Shields are under 20%.
Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here as soon as possible.
Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.
Unless you can shut down their weapons, it's not going to do us much good.
Damn it.
Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my attack run to the target hyperdrive.
Roger that, leader.
I'm on my way.
The remaining darts are returning to the hives.
Can you go to max thrust?
Negative.
- Head back to the Daedalus.
- Roger that.
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.
Why the hell did they do that?
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.
- Sheppard?
- His fighter isn't one of them.
The only contacts I have on screen are wreckage.
- What about his locator beacon?
- Nothing, sir.
He's just gone.
Understood.
Okay.
This is new.
Colonel Caldwell.
What's the status of the repairs?
Ongoing.
We lost a few key personnel in the attack.
Yes, we did.
I'm sorry.
So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them.
I've just briefed general landry.
We're to check in in an hour and advise him of our response to this.
I've got a broken ship and serious casualties.
I don't know what sort of response you have in mind, but-
- I want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me?
As long as they're still in striking distance, we have to at least try.
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.
Radek?
Obviously they've upgraded their ftl drives using the information they were able to steal from our database.
- The aurora mission reports- - obviously.
However, their ships are organic in nature.
They will need to make brief pauses to recover from the effects of hyperspace radiation.
Where and when?
- Uh, it will take some time to calculate.
- Go.
- Okay.
Look, dr.
Weir, I want to go after these bastards as much as you do, but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now.
Our shields are severely depleted.
Several decks are inaccessible.
Even if we could catch up with them, I don't know how long we'd last.
Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.
It was recalled the moment the wraith computer virus was revealed.
It's in no better shape than Daedalus.
It will fly, and by the time you reach the hive ships,
- it should also be able to fight.
- And if it isn't?
Currently, stargate command has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach earth.
They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.
You know what you're asking me to do.
I do.
There are still repairs that need to be made.
Do what you have to do.
They couldn't have.
Even if they somehow deduced the location of earth, they still wouldn't be able to get there, not unless they... they downloaded something along with the hive ship plans, something like spyware.
It's like when I stupidly downloaded por- music.
When I downloaded music.
I asked them to do it.
I did this.
I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.
If anybody was going to do it, it'd be you.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for that.
Stop worrying about it now.
Just focus.
What is there to focus on?
I'm stuck in a cocoon.
- Getting out of here.
- Oh, right.
Of course.
Now, why didn't i think of that?
Of course.
Okay, here goes.
Um, nope.
Still can't move.
I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof, big guy.
Okay, can't sit here forever.
Hit 'em while they're in hyperspace, and they'll never know what happened.
Is that even possible?
There is no reason to believe that their hyperspace field is any different from ours, and we can't launch 302s from the Daedalus while in hyperspace.
I'm talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it.
What do you think?
- Hmm?
- What?
Colonel?
- Yes.
- He's not listening.
I've got to pay more attention to those guys.
Yes, "Michael"?
You should have told me that we were going to betray the atlantians.
- Are you feeling sympathy for them?
- No... but I don't understand why I wasn't told.
I told you of their plan because I believed it was a viable way of-
You're only alive, because you may prove to be useful, but I fear, Michael, that the lingering stench of what they've transformed you into... will never fade.
In approximately one hour, the wraith will drop out of hyperspace... here.
It's just outside of the pegasus galaxy.
There they will pause for 15 hours.
If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule, they should be able to reach those coordinates in just under 14 hours, best possible speed.
Narrow window.
- It's the only window, sir.
- Understood.
Now, the international oversight advisory want you to brief them on this matter.
When would you like me to dial in again?
You misunderstand me.
I mean in person, and I mean right now.
- The president himself-
- I can't just leave, not now.
I'm afraid that's not up to you.
- There is far too much going on here- - doctor... you've done all you're going to do for now.
I need you to step through that gate.
They're waiting for you in my briefing room.
Dr. Weir?
I see.
Teyla... we are waiting several teams to return from their missions.
Once that happens,
I'd like to suspend all gate travel till this whole thing is over.
Of course.
And I'll need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready to leave.
I know what to do, Elizabeth.
Of course you do.
- I will see you when you return.
- Thank you.
- Welcome back to earth.
- Thank you, general.
- It's wonderful to be here.
- I can see that.
You know, I considered disobeying your order.
There wouldn't have been too much you could do about it.
You made the right decision in coming.
We're in the middle of a crisis, general.
- This is absolutely- - don't bite my head off, Elizabeth.
The recall order didn't come from me.
Who it came from doesn't matter.
What if I told you it came from the president?
I wouldn't believe you.
And you'd be right, but in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race.
The president had no choice but to accede to the I.O.A.'S demand that you be brought back to explain yourself.
So, what do they really want?
To point fingers, cover their asses...
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.
They're bureaucrats, Elizabeth.
You'll have 'em for breakfast.
There is work I must attend to.
Stand aside.
Am I to sit quietly in my quarters?
You know, these things are actually quite comfortable.
Surprisingly warm, takes all the pressure off the spine...
I suppose they're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity as we know it.
You're wasting your energy talking.
Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out?
Then what, huh?
We're still on a hive, we're still traveling through hyperspace, probably in the massive void between our two galaxies, where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.
What then, huh?
Do we fly home on the wings of imagination?
Is that what we do, Ronon?
You can sit here and die if you like, but I'm not giving up.
- Oh, fine.
I will.
- Fine!
Okay.
Time to do some damage.
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me?
Rodney?
I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond.
I need to know your location.
Guys?
Colonel Sheppard?
Is that you?
- Who's this?
- You know me as Michael.
Sorry...
I got the wrong number.
Ronon and dr.
McKay are still alive.
What are you going to do with them?
If you want them to live, listen to me.
But if your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships in order for them to reach us.
If you really want to help, why don't you just do that?
- They would know.
- Aren't you "they"?
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.
Oh, I don't know.
I was pretty deceived.
It seems, colonel, that because of what you did to me, the wraith no longer see me as one of their own.
Oh, that's why you want to help, because you don't feel welcome.
We don't have time to discuss this.
Sure we do.
I've got... a good three hours of air left.
- Where are you?
- Oh, wouldn't you like to know.
I need to know what level you're on so I can guide you from there.
You mean trust you.
- Are you in a position not to?
- Oh...
I've got you right where I want you.
I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer, and yet I very much want to continue living.
If you want to survive as I do, then I suggest you tell me where you are.
I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship.
You still want to help?
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive generators would be most effective.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.
The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we were under a time constraint.
to be the problem solving, we distributed a file.
And played right into their hands.
Yes.
In fairness, dr.
Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.
And we supported her recommendations, I know... but clearly, we were not in possession of all of the facts.
Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.
So, what measures have you taken to prevent the wraith from reaching earth?
I was coordinating a strike against the hive ships when you recalled me.
With what?
- With everything we've got.
- Is that wise?
General landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the ori, the weapons platform in Antarctica, powered by a pair of mark ii generators, would be earth's only defense.
Now, I believe it would be far better to stop them while they're still within reach of Atlantis.
Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the zpm back to earth on the Daedalus, ensuring successful operation of the antarctic weapons platform when the wraith arrive?
The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle.
A long journey at full power was out of the question... and there is no way of knowing how much faster the wraith ships have become.
You would risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to undo your mistake?
Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs.
There is still time to beam the zpm aboard.
But either plan will require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.
Then if you'll excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options.
I have instructed Atlantis to contact the sgc when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
If you would like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go right ahead... but you will have to fire me first.
I wonder what they'll do to us.
Feed on us, probably.
I mean, that'S...
that's what they do.
- It's not going to come to that.
- Maybe.
Earth'll probably mount some kind of defense... in which case,I imagine death would be instantaneous... unless we're trapped on a deck with a fire or something.
Then we'd be burned alive.
Oh... burned alive or suffocate.
I wonder which would be worse, being life-sucked by the wraith or burned alive.
I honestly couldn't consider two worse options.
Stop talking.
Okay, you know what?
Make me.
What are you doing?
Where did you get that?
I was trying to get my hands free so I could get to it.
Would it have killed you to tell me?
Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.
What?
don't just stand there.
Cut me loose.
Only if you put an end to all this "we're gonna die, there's no hope" talk.
Well, now there is hope.
Ready.
Kinda little help?
Oh, it's freezing out here.
- Would you prefer to go back in?
- No.
- So now what?
- What?
- How do we get out of here?
- Well, I don't...
- what?
- You said no more death talk.
- McKay...
- We find a way out of cocoon, so what?
We're still stuck on the ship, and there's no way off it without...
- well, in any survivable way.
- You'll think of something.
- It's not a question of- - you'll think of something.
Fine.
Can we at least go somewhere else?
Can you get this off me?
It's down my back.
- It's down my back.
- Just... so, what do they want to do?
They're still arguing about it.
Of course they are.
Incoming wormhole.
This is Atlantis.
We have a scheduled check-in with dr.
Weir.
Stand by, Atlantis.
They haven't reached a decision.
and They don't want to, mr.
Woolsey, because if they agree or disagree with me then they have to take some sort of responsibility.
No, they'd rather have someone to blame.
If I give this order, either way they have a scapegoat if something goes wrong.
It's all part the game.
Ma'am?
Teyla...
Yes, Elizabeth.
Tell colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planed and godspeed.
I will tell him.
Hermiod, what's our status?
Shields are at full strength.
I have re-routed all non-essential power in order to ensure power levels for a longer period.
I want all operable missile tubes loaded with mark iii tactical warheads.
That'll be every one of our nukes, sir.
I'm well aware.
Secondly, I want to disable all firing safeties to enable the launch of every one of our missiles the moment we exit hyperspace.
- I'm not even sure that's possible.
- Make it possible, please.
Yes, sir.
Major lorne, we're approaching our t-zero.
Zelenka says she'll fly, sir, but as of right now, that's about all she can do.
You'll have 13 hours en route to get your weapons and shields online but we need to leave right now to make this window.
Are you go or no-go?
We're go, sir.
Very well.
On my mark.
Three, two, one...
mark.
Are you sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area I'm about to light up?
I'm certain.
Good luck.
Thanks.
It'll be a walk in the park.
A very scary park... filled with monsters who are trying to kill me.
- I don't understand.
- Never mind.
Operation "this will most likely end badly" is a go.
Target is destroyed.
Disable the second hive as quickly as possible.
Their fighters will be already headed your way.
Okay, how about some of this help you were talking about?
I told you to target the hyperdrive.
I already knew that.
There is nothing I can do.
Like hell there isn'T.
Call off the darts.
They won't listen to me.
This is not helpful, Michael.
Dr. Weir... what can I do for you, mr.
Woolsey?
The ambassadors have finished convening.
Oh, good timing.
Uh, yes.
They'd like to continue debriefing you now.
Yeah, I bet they would.
Excuse me?
No.
I'm not going to sit there and have them rake me over the coals about every decision I've made these past two years that they don't agree with in hindsight.
Dr. Weir, you know I have the greatest respect for you but as far as the I.O.A. Is concerned you're not exactly the employee of the month right now.
If the wraith make it to earth, then keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.
And if your plan succeeds?
Then I expect to keep my job, yes because I did what they, apparently, are incapable of doing.
I made a decision.
The fact is, at this point, there really is nothing more we can do but wait and see what happens.
But give them my best.
We have been walking around here for the better part of a day and I haven't seen one exit sign.
Sooner or later, I'm going to have to eat something.
I think I have a plan.
- You?
Really?
- You know a lot about these ships, right?
Well, maybe.
Why?
If I can get you to a control pane
- how much damage could you do?
- What do you mean?
Could you overload the engines and blow up the ship?
How is that an escape plan?
- I never said it was an escape plan.
- How is it a plan?
You're the one who says there's no way out.
If we're already dead, I say we take 'em with us.
I suppose I'd rather die as a hero than as a meal.
- So you can do it?
- Yeah, probably.
Now you're talking.
You should not be here.
She asked me to question the prisoner.
If you'd prefer to discuss it with her... release him.
I will take him from here.
- You had me worried there.
- You've slowed them down... at least for a little while.
We need to get to a transport ship and hope your friends find us.
After we free Ronon and McKay.
We're headed toward them now.
Now... that's what I call help.
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.
Launch the moment the target is acquired. don't wait for my order.
Five, four, three...
- Missiles are on way.
- Dart activity?
Quite a number of them, sir.
They're moving to intercept our missiles.
Now would be a good time, Orion.
What the hell?
One of your ships has launched an attack.
Their first strike inflicted serious damage on this hive.
Good.
The other hive was undamaged, but your vessel is continuing to engage.
Are you going to go through the whole play-by-play, or are we going to get out of here?
This way.
This ship's engaged in battle.
- With who?
- Doesn't matter.
- It matters to us - why?
because if it's our guys, then our chances of survival just went back above zero, albeit fractionally.
If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help them to win the battle.
Now, move it.
One missile got through, sir.
One of the wraith ships suffered serious damage but the other one is...
Sir, the Orion has arrived.
- The other hive is moving to intercept.
- They launched their weapons?
Negative, sir.
Open a secure channel.
Major lorne, now would be a good time to open fire.
Yes, sir.
I was just thinking the same thing.
I gave the order, but nothing happened.
Zelenka!
I'm trying...
We're having a little difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons.
There's a hive bearing down on your position.
Yes, sir, I see that.
Stand by.
Doc, you're killing us.
I have it.
I have it.
Firing drones.
Sir, remaining hive is shifting their attack to the Orion.
Move to intercept.
Orion has no shields.
We're not going to make it there in time, sir.
Where are they?
I'm sorry.
- They must have been taken for feeding.
- No, no.
These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.
Then they could be anywhere on this ship.
- Well, that's a start.
- Why?
What could their objective possibly be?
If I know Ronon, they're somewhere where they can do as much damage as they can where and how to do that, so... there's a control station this way.
One more shot, Zelenka!
That's all I'm asking!
I just cannot give you what I do not have!
There's too much damage!
- We need to abandon ship!
- hi!
listen to me
We sacrificed our shield capability for that first salvo.
This ship is going to blow any moment, major.
Colonel Caldwell, I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our end.
We request immediate beam-out to Daedalus.
Get 'em over here!
Their operating system is a mess.
Thank goodness I remember dos.
Trust me, that was hilarious.
Have you done it yet?
Look, this ship has been seriously damaged.
It's hard for me to find something to overload.
Let Mikey try it.
He's helping us.
Where did you come from?
I managed to latch on to the hull of the hive before it went into hyperspace.
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.
We've got to get to the Daedalus.
The Daedalus is here?
First we need to get to the transport.
Why should I trust you?
Because I'm trusting you.
Because I said so.
- I don't like this.
- You got a better idea?
We take the ship on our own and leave him here.
He's the reason I'm alive right now.
Besides, I don't think that's even possible.
It took me days to crack the wraith dart interface
- and this ship is a whole lot bigger.
- I don't like it.
Yeah, I get it, you hate the wraith.
Him in particular.
Is there anything you can do to boost the radio signal?
I want to reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.
I could try.
hang on!
They'll most likely open fire on us the second we leave the bay.
Oh, great.
The day just gets better and better.
- Sorry, sir.
Did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for.
Bring all rail guns to bear on the main dart bays.
Hold fire till I give the order.
Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then.
I have a contact, sir.
A single wraith ship, possibly a transport, just left the hive and is on a course for us.
It's broadcasting a comm on our frequencies.
What the hell do they want?
Maybe they want to surrender.
Not likely.
Let's hear it.
This is colonel John Sheppard, authentication code alpha seven tango three.
- Please respond.
- Open a channel.
Colonel Sheppard, we'd written you off.
don't get all emotional on me now.
Look, I've got McKay, Ronon, and Michael aboard a wraith transport-
- Michael?
- Yes, sir, and he's got a plan you'll like but it probably won't be long before they start shooting at us.
The hive just opened fire on the transport.
Beam them directly to the bridge.
Colonel.
You said something about a plan?
I have disabled their jamming code, but it's only a matter of time before they realize.
All you have to do is send over a nuke.
We deployed all of our warheads in the first attack.
The hive is launching darts.
Open up on those bays, all batteries!
Cap that off!
Report!
The plan worked, sir.
The concentrated fire on the bays created a number of secondary explosions.
They've stopped firing.
Nice work, colonel.
Fortunately, a draw is a win for our side.
Ship status?
Shields completely depleted, and we're venting atmosphere.
Seal off all affected decks.
Yes, sir, but that last blast took out our life support and the back-ups aren't responding.
As of right now, we're shallow-breathing.
- Meaning?
- Meaning... that in a little under nine hours, we're all going to suffocate.
As long as we don't have to worry about shields and weapons we may be able to cannibalize parts from some of our other systems in order to create, at the very least, a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we got something like that up and running, the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we'd be able to concoct.
It's worth a try.
Yes, yeah, but regardless, we need more electricians and welders than are technically certified on the ship's roster.
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.
There are teams assembling on every deck.
Good, good.
Ah, now we're talking.
How many more of these do we have?
20 in total.
How many people on board?
In and around the 200 mark.
So, I guess buddy-breathing our way through this one is out of the question.
- I'm afraid so, sir, yes.
- Okay they're reserved for people working on getting life-support operational.
We need those people as clear-headed as possible.
- And by "those people"...
- yes, I will be one of them.
- How many levels are inaccessible?
- Seven.
We need to find out if there are pockets of breathable atmosphere in there.
We may be able to squeeze another hour or so out of regions
- that have been sealed off.
- We can't exactly transfer the o2
- where we need it.
- Yes
- but we could be...
- we can access key panels that have been closed off to us.
Let's get Sheppard in a 302.
He can eyeball it from outside.
I'll take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an E.V.A.?
Space suits were stored in those sections.
All right.
I'm heading back.
Copy that.
- Have you tried routing the power...
- yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications?
We are floating between two galaxies, radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send, and even if we were somehow able to repair the array and get a message back to earth, it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking simply of telling them that we stopped the wraith, and perhaps letting someone know the sacrifice that we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only breathable air within light years is on the wraith ship.
There are also wraith aboard that wraith ship, doctor.
So we take 'em.
Beam an assault team in.
You would be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'll take my chances.
I admire your courage, colonel but you would be dead there surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes.
That could work.
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it on board?
- Yes, we do, and now that Michael's disabled their jamming codes... we finish the plan we started.
We beam over the gas and wait.
We wait long enough, they won't even want to put up a fight.
Because they'll be humans with no memories.
I might actually survive this.
We're almost out of breathable air now, and the retrovirus takes a minimum 10 hours to run its course.
We rotate the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship?
I could.
- What are you say
- Get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, sir.
- Anything?
- No.
No contacts yet.
Our tests of the mark two generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.
"Promising. "
That doesn't sound very promising.
We are fairly confident, that the ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships but doing so will probably require the last of our drones and there goes our secret weapon.
We'd really rather not have to do that.
How'd it go with the I.O.A.?
Oh, you know.
I mean... does anyone ever come out of an I.O.A. Deposition saying, "that went well"?
No, I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
Well, at least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're going to ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just going to ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, general... yeah, you did.
And I lost some of the best people I've ever- but you proceeded with the blessing of the I.O.A.,
And stargate command, as I recall.
Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.
"Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts. "
And I think you've got that in spades.
Churchill?
Yeah... except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
- Get some sleep, Elizabeth.
- Yes, sir.
Our CO2 levels... are getting dangerous, sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We've got to go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened?
It's all right.
Find a holding area and start marshaling the survivors there.
The queen's chamber should be that way.
Hello?
You all right?
It's okay.
You're going to be all right now.
It didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
So you might have mentioned, before she almost killed me, Rodney.
I only thought of it now.
Colonel Sheppard, so far we haven't run into a single wraith, sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
- Go ahead.
- You can start sending people over, sir.
They're all human, and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.
TO BE CONTINUED
Previously on Stargate Atlantis...
You're gonna need a name.
How does "Mike" sound?
The retrovirus works.
So much is clear.
Just look at the guy.
I'm returning to what I am.
Not only has our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith, but he's taken with him the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.
We have detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.
I think we can assume it's Michael.
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly?
Everything you've ever wanted to know about Wraith technology but were afraid to ask.
Once we get in range, we can beam the canister into the CO2 chamber and boom!
One hive ship de-Wraithified.
There's been a... change in plans.
Two hive ships bearing down on our position, Sir.
One of them is the friendly.
The Queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labour.
Within the hive ship's schematics was a worm-like computer virus.
What did they get?
The location of every world on our database.
With some 302s we might be able to take out the hyperdrive, save us some time.
Do it!
Shields are at sixty percent!
I've got incoming.
Daggers Three and Four, try to keep these Darts off our six.
Roger that.
Half the bogies are pursuing Daggers Three and Four.
We've got the other half hot on our tail.
Taking fire.
I've lost the generator.
Stand by to break left on my mark...
Mark!
Fox four.
We're in the clear.
Continue to target.
Shields are under twenty percent.
Colonel Sheppard, get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here as soon as possible.
Two minutes.
I can shut down their hyperdrives.
Unless you can shut down their weapons, it's not gonna do us much good.
Dammit!
Dagger Two, I could use some cover on my attack run to the target hyperdrive.
Roger that, Leader.
I'm on my way.
The remaining Darts are returning to the hives.
Can you go to max thrust?
Negative.
Head back to the Daedalus.
Roger that.
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.
Why the hell'd they do that?
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, Sir.
Sheppard?
His fighter isn't one of them.
The only contacts I have on screen are... wreckage.
What about his locator beacon?
Nothing, Sir.
He's just gone.
Understood.
OK.
This is new.
Season 3
- Episode 1:
No Man's Land
Transcript:
Callie Sullivan
Colonel Caldwell.
What's the status of the repairs?
Ongoing.
We lost a few key personnel in the attack.
Yes, we did.
I'm sorry.
So am I. But this isn't the time to mourn them.
I just briefed General Landry.
We're to check in in an hour and advise him of our response to this.
I've got a broken ship and serious casualties.
I don't know what sort of response you have in mind but...
I want you to redeploy immediately.
Excuse me?
As long as they're still in striking distance, we have to at least try.
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.
Radek?
Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives, using the information they were able to steal from our database the Aurora mission reports...
Obviously.
However, the ships are organic in nature.
They will need to make brief pauses to recover from the effects of hyperspace radiation.
Where and when?
It will take some time to calculate.
Go.
Look, Doctor Weir, I wanna go after these bastards as much as you do, but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now.
Our shields are severely depleted and several decks are inaccessible.
Even if we could catch up with them,
I don't know how long we'd last.
Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.
It was recalled the moment the Wraith computer virus was revealed.
And it's in no better shape than Daedalus!
It will fly, and by the time you reach the hive ships, it should also be able to fight.
And if it isn't?
Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth.
They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.
You know what you're asking me to do?
I do.
There's still repairs that need to be made.
Do what you have to do.
They couldn't have.
Even if they somehow deduced the location of Earth, they still wouldn't be able to get there not unless they...
They downloaded something along with the hive ship plans.
Something like spyware.
Something like when I stupidly downloaded porn...
Music!
When I downloaded music!
It has to be...
I did this.
I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet!
If anyone was going to do it, it'd be you.
Thank you!
Thank you so much for that!
Stop worrying about it now.
Just focus.
Focus on what?
What is there to focus on?
I'm stuck in a cocoon!
- On getting out of here.
- Oh, right, of course!
Why didn't I think of that?
!
Of course.
Here goes... no, still can't move.
I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof there, big guy.
OK.
Can't sit here forever.
DISENGAGE DOCKING CLAMPS?
YES ...
NO.
Hit 'em while they're in hyperspace.
They'll never know what happened.
Is that even possible?
There is no reason to believe that their hyperspace field is any different than ours and we can't launch 302s from the Daedalus while in hyperspace.
I'm simply talking about manoeuvring within the field, not passing through it.
What do you think?
Colonel?
What?
...
Yes.
He's not listening.
I gotta pay more attention to those guys.
Yes, Michael?
You should have told me... that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.
Are you feeling sympathy for them?
No.
But I don't understand why I wasn't told.
I told you of their plan because I believed it was a viable way...
You're only alive because you still may prove to be useful.
But I fear,
Michael, that the lingering stench of what they have transformed you into will never fade.
In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace... here.
It's just outside of the Pegasus galaxy.
There, they will pause for fifteen hours.
If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule, they should be able to reach those coordinates in just under fourteen hours, best possible speed.
A narrow window.
It's the only window, Sir.
Understood.
Now, the International Oversight Advisory want you to brief them on this matter.
When would you like me to dial in again?
You misunderstand me.
I mean in person, and I mean right now.
- The President himself assigned...
- I can't just leave, not now.
I'm afraid that's not up to you.
- There is far too much going on here...
- Doctor.
You've done all you're going to do for now.
I need you to step through that Gate.
They're waiting for you in my briefing room.
Doctor Weir?
I see.
Teyla.
We are awaiting several teams to return from their missions.
Once that happens, I'd like to suspend all Gate travel until this whole thing is over.
Of course.
And I'll need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready to leave.
I know what to do, Elizabeth.
Of course you do.
- I will see you when you return.
- Thank you.
Welcome back to Earth.
Thank you, General.
It's wonderful to be here.
I can see that!
You know I considered disobeying your order?
There wouldn't have been too much you could do about it.
You made the right decision in coming.
We're in the middle of a crisis,
- General.
This is absolutely...
- Don't bite my head off, Elizabeth!
The recall order didn't come from me.
Who it came from doesn't matter.
What if I told you it came from the President?
I wouldn't believe you.
And you'd be right.
But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race.
The President had no choice but to accede to the IOA's demand that you be brought back to explain yourself.
So what do they really want?
To point fingers, and cover their asses.
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, Sir.
They're bureaucrats, Elizabeth.
You'll have 'em for breakfast!
There is work I must attend to.
Stand aside!
Then, am I to sit quietly in my quarters?
Now, you see, they're actually quite comfortable.
Surprisingly warm; take all the pressure off the spine.
I suppose it's as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity as we know it.
- You're wasting your energy talking.
- OK.
Let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish and we break out.
Then what, huh?
We're still in a hive, we're still travelling through hyperspace, probably in the massive void between our two galaxies where there aren't even planets, let alone Stargates.
What then, huh?
We fly home on the wings of imagination, is that what we do, Ronon?
You can sit here and die if you like, but I'm not giving up.
- Oh, fine!
I will.
- Fine!
OK.
Time to do some damage.
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me?
Rodney?
I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond.
If you're near a radio, I need you to come in.
I need to know your location.
Guys?
Colonel Sheppard.
Is that you?
Who's this?
You know me as Michael.
Sorry.
Got the wrong number.
Ronon and Doctor McKay are still alive.
What are you gonna do with them?
If you want them to live, listen to me.
I don't know how you got aboard, but if your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships in order for them to reach us.
If you really wanna help, why don't you just do that?
They would know.
Aren't you...
"they"?
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.
Oh, I don't know.
I was pretty deceived.
It seems, Colonel, that because of what you did to me, the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own.
That's why you wanna help, because you don't feel welcome.
- We don't have time to discuss this.
- Sure we do.
I've got, uh, a good three hours of air left.
Where are you?
Wouldn't you like to know?
I need to know what level you're on so I can guide you from there.
You mean trust you?
Are you in a position not to?
Oh...
I've got you right where I want you.
I doubt I'll be allowed to live much longer, and yet I very much want to continue living.
If you want to survive as I do, then I suggest you tell me where you are.
I'm outside the hive in a 302, about to blast your ship.
D'you still wanna help?
Target the ventral hyperdrive generators, will be most effective.
Yeah.
That's what I was thinkin'.
Then I suggest you act now, before you are discovered.
The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we were under a time constraint.
To speed up the problem-solving,
- we distributed the file.
- And played right into their hands.
Yes.
In fairness, Doctor Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.
And we supported her recommendations, I know.
But clearly we were not in possession of all the facts.
Obviously neither were we, Ambassador.
So what measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth?
I was coordinating a strike against the hive ships when you recalled me.
With what?
- With everything we've got.
- Is that wise?
General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori, the weapons platform in Antarctica, powered by a pair of Mark Two generators, would be Earth's only defence.
Now, I believe it would be far better to stop them while they're still within reach of Atlantis.
Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM back to Earth on the Daedalus, ensuring successful operation of the Antarctic weapons platform when the Wraith arrive?
The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle.
A long journey at full power was out of the question and there is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.
You would risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to undo your mistake?
Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs.
There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard.
But either plan will require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.
Then, if you'll excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options.
I have instructed Atlantis to contact the SGC when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
If you would like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go right ahead but you will have to fire me first.
Wonder what they'll do to us?
Feed on us, probably.
I mean, that's...
that's what they do.
It's not gonna come to that.
Maybe.
Earth'll probably mount some kind of defence in which case I imagine death would be instantaneous.
Unless we're trapped on a deck and on fire or something, then we'd be burned alive.
Well, burned alive or suffocate.
I wonder what'd be worse being, life-sucked by the Wraith or... burned alive.
I honestly couldn't consider two worse options.
Stop talking.
OK, you know what?
Make me!
What are you doing?
Where did you get that?
I was trying to get my hand free so I could get to it.
Would it have killed you to tell me?
!
Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.
What?
!
Don't just stand there cut me loose!
Only if you put an end to all this "We're gonna die, there's no hope" talk.
Well, now there is hope!
- Ready?
- No!
A little help, please?
!
Oh!
Oh, it's freezing out here!
- Would you prefer to go back in?
- No!
So now what?
What?
How do we get out of here?
Well, I don't...
- What?
- You said no more death talk.
McKay?
Look, fine, we're out of the cocoons.
So what?
We're still stuck on the ship and there's no way off without
- well, any survivable way.
- You'll think of something.
- It's not a question of thinking...
- You'll think of something.
Fine.
Can we at least go somewhere else?
Can you get this off me?
It's down my back, down my back.
So, what do they wanna do?
They're still arguing about it.
- Of course they are!
- Incoming wormhole.
This is Atlantis.
We have a scheduled check-in with Doctor Weir.
Stand by, Atlantis.
They haven't reached a decision.
And they don't want to, Mr Woolsey, because if they agree or disagree with me, then they have to take some sort of responsibility.
No, they'd rather have someone to blame.
I give this order, either way they have a scapegoat if something goes wrong.
It's all part of the game.
Ma'am?
Teyla?
Yes, Elizabeth?
Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planned.
And Godspeed.
I will tell him.
Hermiod, what's our status?
Shields are at full strength.
I have rerouted all non-essential power in order to ensure power levels for a longer period.
I want all operable missile tubes loaded with Mark Three tactical warheads.
That'd be every one of our nukes, Sir.
I'm well aware of that.
Secondly, I want to disable all firing safeties to enable the launch of every one of our missiles the moment we exit hyperspace.
- I'm not even sure that's possible.
- Make it possible, please.
Yes, Sir.
Major Lorne, we're approaching our T-Zero.
Zelenka says she'll fly, Sir, but as of right now that's about all she can do.
You'll have thirteen hours en route to get your weapons and shields online, but we need to leave right now to make this window.
Are you go or no go?
We're go, Sir.
Very well.
On my mark.
Three, two, one, mark.
Are you sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area I'm about to light up?
I'm certain.
Good luck.
Thanks!
It'll be a walk in the park... a very scary park... filled with monsters who are trying to kill me.
- I don't understand.
- Never mind.
Operation "This Will Most Likely End Badly" is a go.
Target is distroyed.
Disable the second hive as quickly as possible.
Their fighters will already be headed your way.
OK, how about some of this help you were talking about?
- I told you to target the hyperdrive.
- I already knew that!
- There is nothing I can do.
- Like hell there isn't!
Call off the Darts.
- They won't listen to me
- This is not helpful, Michael!
Doctor Weir.
- What can I do for you, Mr Woolsey?
- The ambassadors have finished convening.
Oh, good timing...
Uh, yes.
They'd like to continue debriefing you now.
Yeah, I bet they would.
Exuse me?
No.
I'm not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals about every decision I've made these past two years that they don't agree with in hindsight.
Doctor Weir, you know I have the greatest respect for you, but as far as the IOA is concerned, you're not exactly the employee of the month right now.
If the Wraith make it to Earth, then keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.
And if your plan succeeds?
Then I expect to keep my job, yes, because I did what they apparently are incapable of doing, I made a decision.
And the fact is, at this point, there really is nothing we can do but wait and see what happens.
But give them my best!
We have been walking around here for the better part of a day and I haven't seen one exit sign.
Look, sooner or later I'm gonna have to eat something.
I think I have a plan.
- You?
Really?
- You know all about these ships, right?
May be Why?
If I can get you to a control panel, how much damage could you do?
What do you mean?
- Could you overload the engines and blow up the ship?
- How is that an escape plan?
!
- I never said it was an escape plan.
- Well, how is that a plan?
You're the one who says there's no way out of this.
If we're already dead, I say we take them with us.
- I suppose I'd rather die as a hero than as a meal.
- So you can do it?
- Yeah, probably.
- Now you're talkin'.
You should not be here.
She asked me to question the prisoner.
If you prefer to discuss it with her...
Release him.
I will take him from here.
You had me worried there.
You slowed them down... at least for a little while.
We need to get to a transport ship and hope your friends find us.
Not 'til we free Ronon and McKay.
We're headed toward them now.
You know... that's what I call help.
Exiting hyperspace in ten seconds.
Launch the moment the target is acquired.
Don't wait for my order.
Five... four... three...
Missiles are away.
- Dart activity?
- Quite a number of them, Sir.
They're moving to intercept our missiles.
Now would be a good time, Orion.
What the hell?
One of your ships has launched an attack.
The first strike has done serious damage on this hive.
Good.
The other hive is undamaged.
Your vessel's continuing to engage...
Are we gonna go through the whole play by play, or are we gonna get out of here?
This way.
- The ship's engaged in battle.
- With who?
- Doesn't matter.
- Well, it matters to us!
- Why?
- Because if it's our guys, then our chances of survival just went back above zero, albeit a fraction.
If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help them win the battle.
Now, move it.
One missile got through, Sir.
One of the Wraith ships suffered serious damage, but the other one is...
Sir, the Orion has arrived.
- The other hive is moving to intercept.
- Did they launch their weapons?
Negative, Sir.
Open a secure channel.
Major Lorne, now would be a good time to open fire.
Yes, Sir, I was just thinkin' the same thing.
I gave the order but nothing happened.
Zelenka!
I'm trying, do prdele!
We're having a little difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons.
There's a hive bearing down on your position.
Yes, Sir, I see that.
- Stand by.
Doc, you're killing us here.
- OK.
I have it.
I have it.
I have it.
Firing drones!
Sir, the remaining hive is shifting their attack to the Orion.
Move to intercept.
Orion has no shields.
We're not gonna make it there in time, Sir.
Where are they?
I'm sorry.
They must have been taken for feeding.
No, look.
These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.
They could be anywhere on the ship.
Well, that's a start.
Why?
What could their objective possibly be?
If I know Ronon, they're somewhere where they can do as much damage as they can.
McKay would know where, and how to do that, so...
There's a control station this way.
- One more shot, Zelenka, that's all I'm asking!
- I just cannot give you what I don't have!
There's too much damage!
- We need to abandon ship!
- Hey!
Doc!
Listen to me!
We sacrificed our shield capability for our first salvo!
This ship is going to blow any moment, Major!
Colonel Caldwell.
I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our end.
Request immediate beam-out to Daedalus.
Get em over here!
Their operating system is a mess.
Thank goodness I remembered DOS.
- Trust me, that was hilarious.
- Have you done it yet?
OK, this ship has been seriously damaged.
It's hard for me to find something to overload.
Let Mikey try it.
He's helping us.
Where did you come from?
!
I managed to latch onto the hull of the hive before we went into hyperspace.
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.
We've gotta get to the Daedalus.
The Daedalus?
The Daedalus is here?
First we need to get to the transport.
Now, why should I trust you?
Because I'm trusting you.
Because I said so.
- I don't like this.
- You got a better idea?
Yeah.
We take this ship on our own and leave him here.
He's the reason I'm alive right now.
Besides, I don't think that's even possible.
It took me days to crack the Wraith Dart interface, and this ship is a whole lot bigger.
- I don't like it.
- Yeah, I get it.
You hate the Wraith.
Him in particular.
Is there anything you can do to boost a radio signal?
I wanna reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.
- I can try.
- Hang on
They'll most likely open fire on us the second we leave the bay.
Oh, great!
The day just gets better and better.
- Sorry, Sir.
We did our best.
- Nothing to apologise for, Major.
Bring all rail guns to bear on the main Dart bays.
Hold fire until I give the order.
Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then.
I have a contact, Sir.
A single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.
It just left the hive and is on a course for us.
It's broadcasting a comm on our frequencies.
- What the hell do they want?
- Maybe they want to surrender.
Not likely.
Let's hear it.
This is Colonel John Sheppard.
Authentication code Alpha Seven Tango Three.
Please respond.
Open a channel.
Colonel Sheppard.
We'd written you off.
Don't get all emotional on me now!
Look, I've got McKay, Ronon and Michael aboard a Wraith transport.
Michael?
Yes, Sir.
And he's got a plan I think you're gonna like.
But it probably won't be long before they start shooting at us.
Hive just opened fire on the transport, Sir.
Beam them directly to the Bridge.
Colonel.
Colonel, you said something about a plan?
I've disabled their jamming code, but it's only a matter of time before they realise.
All you have to do is send over a nuke.
We deployed all our warheads in the first attack.
The hive is launching Darts, Sir.
Open up those bays, all batteries!
Cap that off!
Report!
The plan worked, Sir.
The concentrated fire on the bays created a number of secondary explosions.
They've stopped firing.
Nice work, Colonel.
Fortunately a draw's a win for our side.
Ship's status?
Shields completely depleted, and we're venting atmosphere.
Seal off all affected decks.
Yes, Sir, but that last blast took out our life support and the back-ups aren't responding.
As of right now, we're shallow breathing.
Meaning?
Meaning that in a little under nine hours, we're all gonna suffocate.
As long as we don't have to worry about shields and weapons, we may be able to cannibalise parts from some of our other systems in order to create at the very least a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we've got something like that up and running, the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we'd be able to concoct.
- But it's worth a try.
- Yes.
Yeah, but regardless, we need more electricians and welders than are technically certified on this ship's roster.
Anyone, and I mean anyone who took Shop needs to report to us.
- There are teams assembling on every deck.
- Good.
Good.
Ah, now we're talking.
How many more of these do we have?
Twenty in total.
How many people on board?
In and around the two hundred mark.
Oh, so I guess buddy-breathing our way through this one's out of the question.
I'm afraid so, Sir, yes.
OK, fine they're reserved for people working on getting life support systems operational.
We need those people as clear-headed as possible.
And, by those people...
Yes, I will be one of them.
How many levels are inaccessible?
Seven.
OK, we need to find out if there's any pockets of breathable atmosphere in there.
We may be able to squeeze another hour or so from the regions that have been sealed off.
We can't exactly transfer the O2 where we need it.
Yes, but we could be... be able to access key panels that have been closed off to us.
Let's get Sheppard in a 302 he can eyeball it from the outside.
I'll take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an EVA?
The spacesuits were stored in those sections.
Alright.
I'm headin' back.
Copy that.
Have you tried routing the power through the inertial...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications?
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send.
Even if we were somehow able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking simply of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith and perhaps letting someone know the sacrifice that we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only breathable air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
There's also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, Doctor.
So we take 'em.
Beam an assault team in.
You will be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'll take my chances.
I admire your courage, Colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes!
That could work!
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it on board?
- Yes, we do.
- And now that Michael's disabled their jamming codes...
- We finish the plan we started!
We beam over the gas and wait.
If we wait long enough, they won't even wanna put up a fight.
Because they'll be humans with no memories!
I can't believe we might actually survive this!
We're almost out of breathable air now, and the retrovirus takes a minimum ten hours to run its course.
Well, we'll take the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship?
I could.
What d'you say, Colonel?
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, Sir.
Anything?
No.
No contact yet.
Our tests of the Mark Two generator and the Chair in Antarctica are promising.
- Promising.
That doesn't sound very promising.
- We're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will... take care of the hive ships but doing so will probably require the last of our drones, and there goes our secret weapon.
I'd really rather not have to do that.
How'd it go with the IOA?
Oh, you know.
I mean... does anyone ever come out of an IOA deposition saying, "That went well"?
!
No.
I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
At least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're gonna ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just gonna ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, General.
Yeah.
You did.
- And I lost some of the best people I ever...
- But you proceeded with the blessing of the IOA and Stargate Command, as I recall.
Somehow that doesn't seem to help much.
Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts.
And I think you've got that in spades.
Churchill?
Yeah.
Except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
Get some sleep, Elizabeth.
Yes, Sir.
Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, Sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We've gotta go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened?
Alright.
It's alright.
Find a holding area, start marshalling the survivors there.
The Queen's Chamber should be that way.
Hello?
You alright?
It's OK.
You're gonna be alright now.
It didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
Yeah.
Something you might have mentioned before she almost killed me, Rodney.
I only thought of it now.
Colonel Sheppard.
So far we haven't run into a single Wraith, Sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
Go ahead.
You can start sending people over, Sir.
They're all human and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.
Previously on Stargate Atlantis:
Gonna need a name.
How does mike sound?
The retrovirus works.
Just look at the guy.
- I'm returning to what I am.
- Our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith.
He's taken the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.
We've detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.
I think we can assume it's Michael.
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly?
Everything you've wanted to know about Wraith technology.
Once we get in range, we beam a canister into the CO2 chamber and:
One hive ship de-Wraithified.
There's been a change in plans.
Two hive ships on our position.
One of them is the friendly.
The queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labor.
Within the ship's schematics was a worm-like computer virus.
What did they get?
The location of every world in our database.
With 302s, we might take out the hyperdrive, save us some time.
Do it.
Shields are at 60 percent.
- I've got incoming.
- Daggers 3 and 4 try to keep these Darts off our six.
- Roger that.
Half the bogeys are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4.
We got the other half hot on our tail.
I'm taking fire.
I've lost a generator.
Stand by to break left on my mark.
Mark.
Fox 4.
We're in the clear.
Continue to target.
Shields are under 20 percent.
Get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here.
Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.
Unless you can shut down their weapons it's not gonna do much good.
Damn it.
Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my attack run of the target.
Roger that, leader.
I'm on my way.
The Darts are returning to the hives.
Can you go to max thrust?
Negative.
- Head back to the Daedalus.
- Roger that.
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.
Why the hell did they do that?
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.
- Sheppard?
- His fighter isn't one of them.
The only contacts I have on-screen are wreckage.
- What about his locator beacon?
- Nothing, sir.
He's just gone.
Understood.
Okay, this is new.
Colonel Caldwell, what's the status of the repairs?
Ongoing.
We lost a few key personnel in the attack.
Yes, we did.
I'm sorry.
So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them.
I've just briefed General Landry.
We're to check in and advise him of our response.
I've got a broken ship and casualties.
I don't know what you have in mind...
- I want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me?
As long as they're still in striking distance we have to try.
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.
- Radek?
- Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives using the information from our database.
- The Aurora mission.
- Obviously.
However, their ships are organic in nature.
They will need to make brief pauses to recover from hyperspace radiation.
- Where and when?
- It will take some time to calculate.
- Go.
- Okay.
Dr. Weir, I wanna go after these bastards as much as you do but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now.
Our shields are depleted.
Several decks are inaccessible.
Even if we could catch up, I don't know how long we'd last.
Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.
It was recalled the moment the virus was revealed.
- It's in no better shape than Daedalus.
- It will fly.
And by the time you reach the hive ships it should also be able to fight.
- And if it isn't?
- Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth.
They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.
You know what you're asking me to do?
I do.
There's still repairs that need to be made.
Do what you have to do.
They couldn't have.
If they deduced the location of Earth they wouldn't be able to get there, unless they...
They downloaded something along with the hive-ship plans.
Something like spyware.
It's like when I stupidly downloaded por...
Music, when I downloaded music.
I asked them to do it.
I did this.
I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.
Anybody was gonna do it, it'd be you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for that.
Stop worrying now.
Just focus.
On what?
What is there to focus on?
I'm stuck in a cocoon.
- Getting out of here.
- Right.
Of course.
Why didn't I think of that?
Of course.
Here goes.
Nope, still can't move.
I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof there, big guy.
Okay, can't sit here forever.
Hit them while they're in hyperspace, they'll never know what happened.
Is that even possible?
There's no reason to believe their hyperspace field is different and we can't launch 302s while in hyperspace.
I'm talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it.
What do you think?
- Colonel?
- What?
Yes.
He's not listening.
I gotta pay more attention to those guys.
Yes, Michael?
You should have told me that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.
- Are you feeling sympathy for them?
- No.
But I don't understand why I wasn't told.
I told you their plan because I believe it was a viable way...
You are only alive because you still may prove to be useful.
But I fear, Michael that the lingering stench of what they've transformed you into will never fade.
In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace here.
It's just outside of the Pegasus galaxy.
There they will pause for 15 hours.
If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule they should reach those coordinates in just under 14 hours, best possible speed.
Narrow window.
It's the only window, sir.
Understood.
Now, the International Oversight Advisory wants you to brief them on this matter.
- When would you like me to dial again?
- You misunderstand me.
I mean in person, and I mean right now.
- The president himself is...
- I can't just leave.
Not now.
I'm afraid that's not up to you.
- There is far too much going on here.
- Doctor.
You've done all you're going to do for now.
I need you to step through that gate.
They're waiting for you in my briefing room.
Dr. Weir?
I see.
Teyla, we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions.
Once that happens, I'd like to suspend gate travel till this is over.
Of course.
I'll need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready.
I know what to do, Élizabeth.
Of course you do.
- I will see you when you return.
- Thank you.
Welcome back to Earth.
Thank you, general.
It's wonderful to be here.
I can see that.
You know, I considered disobeying your order.
There wouldn't have been too much you could do.
You made the right decision in coming.
We're in the middle of a crisis.
This is absolutely...
Don't bite my head off, Élizabeth.
The recall order didn't come from me.
Who it came from doesn't matter.
What if I told you it came from the president?
I wouldn't believe you.
And you'd be right.
But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race.
The president had no choice but to accede to the I. O.A. 's demand that you be brought back to explain.
So, what do they really want?
To point fingers, cover their asses.
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.
They're bureaucrats, Élizabeth.
You'll have them for breakfast.
There is work I must attend to.
Stand aside!
Am I to sit quietly in my quarters?
You know, these are actually quite comfortable.
Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine.
They're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity.
You're wasting your energy talking.
Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out?
Then what, huh?
We're in a hive, traveling through hyperspace probably in the massive void between our two galaxies where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.
What then, huh?
We fly home on the wings of imagination?
- Is that what we do, Ronon?
- You can sit here and die but I'm not giving up.
- Oh, fine.
I will.
- Fine!
Okay, time to do some damage.
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me?
Rodney?
I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond.
If you're near a radio, I need you to come in.
I need to know your location.
Guys?
Colonel Sheppard.
- Is that you?
- Who's this?
- You know me as Michael.
- Sorry, got the wrong number.
Ronon and Dr. McKay are still alive.
- What are you gonna do with them?
- If you want them to live, listen to me.
If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships for them to reach us.
If you really wanna help, why don't you just do that?
- They would know.
- Aren't you "they"?
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.
Oh, I don't know.
I was pretty deceived.
It seems that because of what you did to me the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own.
That's why you wanna help, because you don't feel welcome.
- We don't have time to discuss this.
- Sure we do.
I've got a good three hours of air left.
- Where are you?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
I need to know what level you're on so I can guide you from there.
You mean trust you?
Are you in a position not to?
I've got you right where I want you.
I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer and yet I very much want to continue living.
If you want to survive as I do then I suggest you tell me where you are.
I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship.
You still wanna help?
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive would be most effective.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.
The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we were under a time constraint.
To speed up the problem solving, we distributed the file.
And played right into their hands.
Yes.
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.
And we supported her recommendations, I know.
But clearly, we were not in possession of all of the facts.
Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.
What measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth?
I was coordinating a strike when you recalled me.
With what?
- With everything we've got.
- Is that wise?
General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori the weapons platform in Antarctica powered by a pair of Mark-ll generators would be Earth's only defense.
I believe it would be better to stop them while they're within reach of Atlantis.
Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM back to Earth on the Daedalus ensuring successful operation of the weapons platform when the Wraith arrive?
The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle.
A long journey at full power was out of the question.
There is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.
You'd risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to undo your mistake?
Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs.
There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard.
But either plan will require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.
Then if you'll excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options.
I have instructed Atlantis to contact the SGC when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
If you'd like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go ahead.
But you will have to fire me first.
Wonder what they'll do to us.
Feed on us probably.
I mean, that's...
That's what they do.
It's not gonna come to that.
Maybe.
Earth will probably mount some kind of defense.
In which case, death would be instantaneous.
Unless we're trapped on a deck with a fire or something.
Then we'd be burned alive.
Well, burned alive or suffocate.
I wonder which would be worse:
Being life-sucked by the Wraith, or burned alive.
I couldn't consider two worse options.
- Stop talking.
- Okay, you know what?
Make me.
What are you doing?
Where did you get that?
I was trying to get my hand free so I could get it.
Would it have killed you to tell me?
Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.
What?
Don't just stand there.
Cut me loose.
Only if you put an end to all this "we're gonna die, there's no hope" talk.
Well, now there's hope.
Get ready.
A little help with this?
- It's freezing out here.
- Would you prefer to go back in?
- No.
- So now what?
- What?
- How do we get out of here?
- Well, I don't...
- What?
- You said no more death talk.
- Okay.
We're out of the cocoons.
So what?
We're still on the ship.
There's no way off it.
- Well, any survivable way.
- You'll think of something.
- It's not a question of thinking.
- You'll think of something.
Fine.
Can we at least go somewhere else?
Can you get this off me?
It's down my back.
It's down my back.
Just...
So, what do they wanna do?
They're still arguing about it.
- Of course they are.
- Incoming wormhole.
This is Atlantis.
We have a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.
Stand by, Atlantis.
They haven't reached a decision.
And they don't want to, Mr. Woolsey.
If they agree or disagree with me, then they have to take some responsibility.
They'd rather have someone to blame.
I give this order either way, they have a scapegoat.
It's all part of the game.
Ma'am?
Teyla.
Yes, Élizabeth.
Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planned and Godspeed.
- I will tell him.
Hermiod, what's our status?
Shields are at full strength.
I've rerouted nonessential power in order to ensure power levels for a longer period.
I want all missile tubes loaded with Mark-lll tactical warheads.
- That would be every one.
- I'm aware of that.
Disable all firing safeties to launch every one of our missiles the moment we exit hyperspace.
- I'm not sure that's possible.
- Make it possible, please.
- Yes, sir.
Major Lorne, we're approaching our T-zero.
Zelenka says she'll fly, sir, but as of right now that's about all she can do.
You'll have 13 hours to get your weapons and shields online.
We need to leave now to make this window.
Are you go or no-go?
We're a go, sir.
Very well.
On my mark:
Three, two, one, mark.
You sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area I'm about to light up?
I'm certain.
Good luck.
Thanks.
It'll be a walk in the park.
A very scary park filled with monsters who are trying to kill me.
- I don't understand.
- Never mind.
Operation This-Will-Most-Likely-End-Badly is a go.
Target is destroyed.
Disable the second hive quickly.
Their fighters will be headed your way.
How about this help you were talking about?
- I told you, target the hyperdrive.
- I already knew that.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Like hell there isn't.
Call off the Darts.
They won't listen to me.
This is not helpful, Michael.
Dr. Weir?
What can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey?
The ambassadors have finished convening.
Oh, good timing.
Yes.
They'd like to continue debriefing you now.
- Yeah, I bet they would.
- Excuse me?
No.
I'm not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals about every decision I've made that they don't agree with in hindsight.
I have the greatest respect for you but as far as the I. O.A. Is concerned you're not exactly the employee of the month.
If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.
- And if your plan succeeds?
- Then I expect to keep my job, yes.
Because I did what they apparently are incapable of doing.
I made a decision.
The fact is, at this point, there is nothing more we can do but wait and see what happens.
But give them my best.
We have been walking around here for a day and I haven't seen one exit sign.
Sooner or later, I'll have to eat something.
- I think I have a plan.
- You?
Really?
- You know a lot about these ships, right?
- Maybe.
Why?
If I get you to a panel, how much damage could you do?
- What?
- Overload the engines and blow the ship?
- How is that an escape plan?
- I never said it was.
- That's a plan?
- You said there's no way out.
- If we're dead, let's take them with us.
- I'd rather die a hero than a meal.
- You can do it?
- Yeah, probably.
Now you're talking.
You should not be here.
She asked me to question the prisoner.
If you'd prefer to discuss it with her...
Release him.
I will take him from here.
You had me worried there.
You've slowed them down, at least for a little while.
We need to get to a ship, hope your friends find us.
Not till we free Ronon and McKay.
We're headed toward them now.
Now, that's what I call help.
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.
Launch the moment the target's acquired.
Don't wait.
Five, four, three...
- Missiles are away.
- Dart activity?
Quite a number of them.
They're moving to intercept our missiles.
Now would be a good time, Orion.
What the hell?
One of your ships has launched an attack.
Their strike inflicted damage on this hive.
Good.
The other was undamaged.
Your vessel's continuing to engage.
Are you gonna go through the play-by-play or get out of here?
This way.
- Ship's engaged in battle.
- With who?
- Doesn't matter.
- Matters to us.
- Why?
- If it's our guys our chance went back above zero, fractionally.
If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help them.
Move it.
One missile got through, sir.
One of the Wraith ships suffered damage but the other one...
The Orion has arrived.
The hive is moving to intercept.
- They launched their weapons?
- Negative, sir.
Open a secure channel.
Major Lorne, now would be a good time to open fire.
Yes, I was thinking the same.
I gave the order, but nothing happened.
Zelenka?
I'm trying!
We're having difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons.
- There's a hive bearing on your position.
- Yes, sir.
I see.
- Stand by.
Doc, you're killing us.
- Okay.
I have it.
Firing drones.
The remaining hive is shifting their attack to Orion.
Move to intercept.
Orion has no shields.
We're not gonna make it there in time, sir.
Where are they?
I'm sorry.
They must have been taken for feeding.
No, no.
These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.
They could be anywhere on this ship.
Well, that's a start.
Why?
What could their objective possibly be?
If I know Ronon, they're somewhere they can do much damage.
And McKay would know where and how to do that, so...
There's a control station this way.
One more shot, that's all I'm asking.
I just cannot give you what I don't have.
There's too much damage.
We need to abandon ship.
- Listen to me.
- We sacrificed our shield capability for that first salvo.
This ship is going to blow any moment, major.
Caldwell, I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our end.
Request immediate beam out to Daedalus.
Get them over here.
Their operating system is a mess.
Thank goodness I remember DOS.
- Trust me, that was hilarious.
- Have you done it yet?
Look, this ship has been seriously damaged.
It's hard for me to find something to overload.
Let Mikey try.
- He's helping us.
- Where did you come from?
I latched onto the hull before it went into hyperspace.
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.
- We gotta get to the Daedalus.
- The Daedalus is here?
- We need to get to the transport.
- Why should I trust you?
Because I'm trusting you.
Because I said so.
- I don't like this.
- You got a better idea?
We take the ship on our own and leave him here.
He's the reason I'm alive now.
I don't think that's possible.
It took days to crack the Dart interface.
- This ship is bigger.
- I don't like it.
- Yeah, I get it.
You hate the Wraith.
- Him in particular.
Is there anything to boost a signal?
I wanna reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.
- Well, I could try.
- Hang on.
They'll open fire on us the second we leave the bay.
Oh, great.
The day just gets better and better.
- Sorry, sir.
We did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for.
Bring guns to bear on the Dart bays.
Hold fire till I order.
Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then.
I have a contact.
Single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.
Just left the hive and is on a course for us.
- It's broadcasting on our frequencies.
- What do they want?
- Maybe they want to surrender?
- Not likely.
Let's hear it.
This is Sheppard, authentication code Alpha-Seven-Tango-Three.
Please respond.
Open a channel.
Colonel Sheppard, we'd written you off.
Don't get all emotional on me now.
I've got mckay, Ronon and michael aboard a Wraith transport.
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.
He's got a plan you'll like.
It won't be long before they start shooting at us.
- The hive opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.
- Colonel.
- You said something about a plan?
I've disabled their jamming code.
It's a matter of time before they realize.
- All you have to do is send a nuke.
- We deployed all our warheads.
- The hive is launching Darts.
- Open up on those bays, all batteries.
Shut that off!
- Report.
- The plan worked, sir.
The concentrated fire on the bays created secondary explosions.
- They've stopped firing.
- Nice work, colonel.
A draw is a win for our side.
Ship status?
Shields completely depleted.
We're venting atmosphere.
Seal off all affected decks.
That last blast took out life support.
The backups aren't responding.
Right now, we're shallow-breathing.
- Meaning?
- Meaning that in under nine hours we're all gonna suffocate.
As long as we don't worry about shields and weapons we may be able to cannibalize parts from other systems in order to create a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we got that up and running the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we concoct.
- But it's worth a try.
- Yes, but regardless we need more electricians and welders than are certified on this ship.
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.
- Teams assembling on every deck.
- Good, good.
Now we're talking.
How many more of these do we have?
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard?
In and around the 200 mark.
Buddy-breathing our way through is out of the question.
- I'm afraid so, sir.
Yes.
- Okay, fine.
They're for people working on life support.
- We need those people clear-headed.
- By "those people" ...?
- I'll be one.
- How many levels inaccessible?
- Seven.
- We need to find out if there's pockets of atmosphere.
We may squeeze another hour from the regions sealed off.
- We can't transfer the O2 where we need.
- We could...
We'll be able to access panels closed off.
Get Sheppard in a 302.
He can eyeball it from the outside.
I'll take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an EVA?
Space suits were stored in those sections.
- All right, I'm heading back.
- Copy that.
Have you tried routing from the inertial...?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications?
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send.
Even if we were able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith.
Letting someone know the sacrifice we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
There's also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor.
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.
You would be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'll take my chances.
I admire your courage, colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes.
That could work.
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it onboard?
- Yes, we do.
michael's disabled their jamming codes...
- We finish the plan we started.
- We beam over the gas and wait.
We wait long enough, they won't wanna put up a fight.
They'll be humans with no memories.
I might actually survive this.
We're almost out of air.
The retrovirus takes 10 hours to run its course.
Yeah, well, we'll rotate the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship?
I could.
What do you say, colonel?
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, sir.
- Anything?
- No.
No contacts yet.
Our tests of the Mark-ll generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.
"Promising." That doesn't sound very promising.
We're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships but doing so will probably require the last of our drones and there goes our secret weapon.
We'd really rather not have to do that.
How'd it go with the I. O. A?
Oh, you know.
I mean, does anyone ever come out of an I. O.A. Deposition saying:
"That went well"?
No, I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
At least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're gonna ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just gonna ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, general.
Yeah, you did.
I lost some of the best people...
You proceeded with the blessing of the I. O.A.
And Stargate Command, as I recall.
Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.
Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts.
And I think you've got that in spades.
- Churchill?
- Yeah.
Except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
- Get some sleep, Élizabeth.
- Yes, sir.
Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We gotta go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened?
All right.
It's all right.
Find a holding area.
Start marshaling the survivors there.
The queen's chamber should be that way.
Hello?
You all right?
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right now.
Didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
Something you might've mentioned before she almost killed me.
- I only thought of it now.
- Colonel Sheppard.
So far we haven't run into a single Wraith, sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
- Go ahead.
- You can start sending people over.
They're all human and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.
Previously on Stargate Atlantis:
Gonna need a name.
How does mike sound?
The retrovirus works.
Just look at the guy.
- I'm returning to what I am.
- Our dear lieutenant rejoined the Wraith.
He's taken the knowledge that Atlantis still exists.
We've detected a hive ship heading towards Atlantis.
I think we can assume it's Michael.
Your retrovirus will allow us to feed off enemy Wraith.
- Receiving transmission.
- What is, exactly?
Everything you've wanted to know about Wraith technology.
Once we get in range, we beam a canister into the CO2 chamber and:
One hive ship de-Wraithified.
There's been a change in plans.
Two hive ships on our position.
One of them is the friendly.
The queen wants you to witness the fruits of your labor.
Within the ship's schematics was a worm-like computer virus.
What did they get?
The location of every world in our database.
With 302s, we might take out the hyperdrive, save us some time.
Do it.
Shields are at 60 percent.
- I've got incoming.
- Daggers 3 and 4 try to keep these Darts off our six.
- Roger that.
Half the bogeys are pursuing Daggers 3 and 4.
We got the other half hot on our tail.
I'm taking fire.
I've lost a generator.
Stand by to break left on my mark.
Mark.
Fox 4.
We're in the clear.
Continue to target.
Shields are under 20 percent.
Get your flight back to the ship.
We need to jump out of here.
Two minutes and I can shut down their hyperdrives.
Unless you can shut down their weapons it's not gonna do much good.
Damn it.
Dagger 2, I could use some cover on my attack run of the target.
Roger that, leader.
I'm on my way.
The Darts are returning to the hives.
Can you go to max thrust?
Negative.
- Head back to the Daedalus.
- Roger that.
The hives are opening hyperspace windows.
Why the hell did they do that?
Three of our 302s are returning to Daedalus, sir.
- Sheppard?
- His fighter isn't one of them.
The only contacts I have on-screen are wreckage.
- What about his locator beacon?
- Nothing, sir.
He's just gone.
Understood.
Okay, this is new.
Colonel Caldwell, what's the status of the repairs?
Ongoing.
We lost a few key personnel in the attack.
Yes, we did.
I'm sorry.
So am I, but this isn't the time to mourn them.
I've just briefed General Landry.
We're to check in and advise him of our response.
I've got a broken ship and casualties.
I don't know what you have in mind...
- I want you to redeploy immediately.
- Excuse me?
As long as they're still in striking distance we have to try.
You know we can't intercept them in hyperspace.
- Radek?
- Well, obviously they've upgraded their FTL drives using the information from our database.
- The Aurora mission.
- Obviously.
However, their ships are organic in nature.
They will need to make brief pauses to recover from hyperspace radiation.
- Where and when?
- It will take some time to calculate.
- Go.
- Okay.
Dr. Weir, I wanna go after these bastards as much as you do but the Daedalus is in no position to fight right now.
Our shields are depleted.
Several decks are inaccessible.
Even if we could catch up, I don't know how long we'd last.
Which is why I'm committing the Orion as well.
It was recalled the moment the virus was revealed.
- It's in no better shape than Daedalus.
- It will fly.
And by the time you reach the hive ships it should also be able to fight.
- And if it isn't?
- Currently, Stargate Command has no vessels capable of engaging the hive ships before they reach Earth.
They cannot be allowed to get that far, Steven.
You know what you're asking me to do?
I do.
There's still repairs that need to be made.
Do what you have to do.
They couldn't have.
If they deduced the location of Earth they wouldn't be able to get there, unless they...
They downloaded something along with the hive-ship plans.
Something like spyware.
It's like when I stupidly downloaded por...
Music, when I downloaded music.
I asked them to do it.
I did this.
I'm responsible for the destruction of my own planet.
Anybody was gonna do it, it'd be you.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much for that.
Stop worrying now.
Just focus.
On what?
What is there to focus on?
I'm stuck in a cocoon.
- Getting out of here.
- Right.
Of course.
Why didn't I think of that?
Of course.
Here goes.
Nope, still can't move.
I'm pretty sure they're struggle-proof there, big guy.
Okay, can't sit here forever.
Hit them while they're in hyperspace, they'll never know what happened.
Is that even possible?
There's no reason to believe their hyperspace field is different and we can't launch 302s while in hyperspace.
I'm talking about maneuvering within the field, not passing through it.
What do you think?
- Colonel?
- What?
Yes.
He's not listening.
I gotta pay more attention to those guys.
Yes, Michael?
You should have told me that we were going to betray the Atlanteans.
- Are you feeling sympathy for them?
- No.
But I don't understand why I wasn't told.
I told you their plan because I believe it was a viable way...
You are only alive because you still may prove to be useful.
But I fear, Michael that the lingering stench of what they've transformed you into will never fade.
In approximately one hour, the Wraith will drop out of hyperspace here.
It's just outside of the Pegasus galaxy.
There they will pause for 15 hours.
If Daedalus and Orion break orbit on our current schedule they should reach those coordinates in just under 14 hours, best possible speed.
Narrow window.
It's the only window, sir.
Understood.
Now, the International Oversight Advisory wants you to brief them on this matter.
- When would you like me to dial again?
- You misunderstand me.
I mean in person, and I mean right now.
- The president himself is...
- I can't just leave.
Not now.
I'm afraid that's not up to you.
- There is far too much going on here.
- Doctor.
You've done all you're going to do for now.
I need you to step through that gate.
They're waiting for you in my briefing room.
Dr. Weir?
I see.
Teyla, we are awaiting several teams to return from their missions.
Once that happens, I'd like to suspend gate travel till this is over.
Of course.
I'll need you to dial in once the Daedalus is ready.
I know what to do, Élizabeth.
Of course you do.
- I will see you when you return.
- Thank you.
Welcome back to Earth.
Thank you, general.
It's wonderful to be here.
I can see that.
You know, I considered disobeying your order.
There wouldn't have been too much you could do.
You made the right decision in coming.
We're in the middle of a crisis.
This is absolutely...
Don't bite my head off, Élizabeth.
The recall order didn't come from me.
Who it came from doesn't matter.
What if I told you it came from the president?
I wouldn't believe you.
And you'd be right.
But in a couple of weeks, there could be aliens on our doorstep determined to feed on the human race.
The president had no choice but to accede to the I. O.A.'s demand that you be brought back to explain.
So, what do they really want?
To point fingers, cover their asses.
I am honestly not sure how I will respond to that, sir.
They're bureaucrats, Élizabeth.
You'll have them for breakfast.
There is work I must attend to.
Stand aside!
Am I to sit quietly in my quarters?
You know, these are actually quite comfortable.
Surprisingly warm, take all the pressure off the spine.
They're as good a place as any to witness the end of humanity.
You're wasting your energy talking.
Okay, let's say a magic fairy comes down and grants you one wish, and we break out?
Then what, huh?
We're in a hive, traveling through hyperspace probably in the massive void between our two galaxies where there aren't even planets, let alone stargates.
What then, huh?
We fly home on the wings of imagination?
- Is that what we do, Ronon?
- You can sit here and die but I'm not giving up.
- Oh, fine.
I will.
- Fine!
Okay, time to do some damage.
Ronon, Rodney, can you hear me?
Rodney?
I know this is a long shot, but if you can hear me, please respond.
If you're near a radio, I need you to come in.
I need to know your location.
Guys?
Colonel Sheppard.
- Is that you?
- Who's this?
- You know me as Michael.
- Sorry, got the wrong number.
Ronon and Dr. McKay are still alive.
- What are you gonna do with them?
- If you want them to live, listen to me.
If your friends are in pursuit, you need to disable these ships for them to reach us.
If you really wanna help, why don't you just do that?
- They would know.
- Aren't you " they" ou "?
Please believe me when I say I was as deceived as you were.
Oh, I don't know.
I was pretty deceived.
It seems that because of what you did to me the Wraith no longer see me as one of their own.
That's why you wanna help, because you don't feel welcome.
- We don't have time to discuss this.
- Sure we do.
I've got a good three hours of air left.
- Where are you?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
I need to know what level you're on so I can guide you from there.
You mean trust you?
Are you in a position not to?
I've got you right where I want you.
I doubt I will be allowed to live much longer and yet I very much want to continue living.
If you want to survive as I do then I suggest you tell me where you are.
I'm outside the hive in a 302 about to blast your ship.
You still wanna help?
Targeting the ventral hyperdrive would be most effective.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Then I suggest you act now before you are discovered.
The leader of the hive presented a scenario which made it seem we were under a time constraint.
To speed up the problem solving, we distributed the file.
And played right into their hands.
Yes.
In fairness, Dr. Weir kept us informed of every action they took along the way.
And we supported her recommendations, I know.
But clearly, we were not in possession of all of the facts.
Obviously, neither were we, ambassador.
What measures have you taken to prevent the Wraith from reaching Earth?
I was coordinating a strike when you recalled me.
With what?
- With everything we've got.
- Is that wise?
General Landry has informed me that in light of fleet resources committed to fighting the Ori the weapons platform in Antarctica powered by a pair of Mark-ll generators would be Earth's only defense.
I believe it would be better to stop them while they're within reach of Atlantis.
Wouldn't it have been more prudent to send the ZPM back to Earth on the Daedalus ensuring successful operation of the weapons platform when the Wraith arrive?
The Daedalus suffered severe damage during the first battle.
A long journey at full power was out of the question.
There is no way of knowing how much faster the Wraith ships have become.
You'd risk the lives of everyone aboard those ships in order to undo your mistake?
Daedalus is in orbit above Atlantis, performing emergency repairs.
There is still time to beam the ZPM aboard.
But either plan will require Daedalus to break orbit within the next hour.
Then if you'll excuse us, we need some time to discuss our options.
I have instructed Atlantis to contact the SGC when both Daedalus and Orion are ready to leave.
If you'd like to overturn my standing orders at that time, go ahead.
But you will have to fire me first.
Wonder what they'll do to us.
Feed on us probably.
I mean, that's...
That's what they do.
It's not gonna come to that.
Maybe.
Earth will probably mount some kind of defense.
In which case, death would be instantaneous.
Unless we're trapped on a deck with a fire or something.
Then we'd be burned alive.
Well, burned alive or suffocate.
I wonder which would be worse:
Being life-sucked by the Wraith, or burned alive.
I couldn't consider two worse options.
- Stop talking.
- Okay, you know what?
Make me.
What are you doing?
Where did you get that?
I was trying to get my hand free so I could get it.
Would it have killed you to tell me?
Maybe I would have if you'd shut up for more than a minute.
What?
Don't just stand there.
Cut me loose.
Only if you put an end to all this " we're gonna die, there's no hope " talk.
Well, now there's hope.
Get ready.
A little help with this?
- It's freezing out here.
- Would you prefer to go back in?
- No.
- So now what?
- What?
- How do we get out of here?
- Well, I don't...
- What?
- You said no more death talk.
- Okay.
We're out of the cocoons.
So what?
We're still on the ship.
There's no way off it.
- Well, any survivable way.
- You'll think of something.
- It's not a question of thinking.
- You'll think of something.
Fine.
Can we at least go somewhere else?
Can you get this off me?
It's down my back.
It's down my back.
Just...
So, what do they wanna do?
They're still arguing about it.
- Of course they are.
- Incoming wormhole.
This is Atlantis.
We have a scheduled check-in with Dr. Weir.
Stand by, Atlantis.
They haven't reached a decision.
And they don't want to, Mr. Woolsey.
If they agree or disagree with me, then they have to take some responsibility.
They'd rather have someone to blame.
I give this order either way, they have a scapegoat.
It's all part of the game.
Ma'am?
Teyla.
Yes, Élizabeth.
Tell Colonel Caldwell to proceed with the mission as planned and Godspeed.
- I will tell him.
Hermiod, what's our status?
Shields are at full strength.
I've rerouted nonessential power in order to ensure power levels for a longer period.
I want all missile tubes loaded with Mark-lll tactical warheads.
- That would be every one.
- I'm aware of that.
Disable all firing safeties to launch every one of our missiles the moment we exit hyperspace.
- I'm not sure that's possible.
- Make it possible, please.
- Yes, sir.
Major Lorne, we're approaching our T-zero.
Zelenka says she'll fly, sir, but as of right now that's about all she can do.
You'll have 13 hours to get your weapons and shields online.
We need to leave now to make this window.
Are you go or no-go?
We're a go, sir.
Very well.
On my mark:
Three, two, one, mark.
You sure McKay and Ronon are nowhere near the area I'm about to light up?
I'm certain.
Good luck.
Thanks.
It'll be a walk in the park.
A very scary park filled with monsters who are trying to kill me.
- I don't understand.
- Never mind.
Operation This-Will-Most-Likely-End-Badly is a go.
Target is destroyed.
Disable the second hive quickly.
Their fighters will be headed your way.
How about this help you were talking about?
- I told you, target the hyperdrive.
- I already knew that.
- There's nothing I can do.
- Like hell there isn't.
Call off the Darts.
They won't listen to me.
This is not helpful, Michael.
Dr. Weir?
What can I do for you, Mr. Woolsey?
The ambassadors have finished convening.
Oh, good timing.
Yes.
They'd like to continue debriefing you now.
- Yeah, I bet they would.
- Excuse me?
No.
I'm not gonna sit there and have them rake me over the coals about every decision I've made that they don't agree with in hindsight.
I have the greatest respect for you but as far as the I. O.A. Is concerned you're not exactly the employee of the month.
If the Wraith make it to Earth, keeping my job will be the least of my concerns.
- And if your plan succeeds?
- Then I expect to keep my job, yes.
Because I did what they apparently are incapable of doing.
I made a decision.
The fact is, at this point, there is nothing more we can do but wait and see what happens.
But give them my best.
We have been walking around here for a day and I haven't seen one exit sign.
Sooner or later, I'll have to eat something.
- I think I have a plan.
- You?
Really?
- You know a lot about these ships, right?
- Maybe.
Why?
If I get you to a panel, how much damage could you do?
- What?
- Overload the engines and blow the ship?
- How is that an escape plan?
- I never said it was.
- That's a plan?
- You said there's no way out.
- If we're dead, let's take them with us.
- I'd rather die a hero than a meal.
- You can do it?
- Yeah, probably.
Now you're talking.
You should not be here.
She asked me to question the prisoner.
If you'd prefer to discuss it with her...
Release him.
I will take him from here.
You had me worried there.
You've slowed them down, at least for a little while.
We need to get to a ship, hope your friends find us.
Not till we free Ronon and McKay.
We're headed toward them now.
Now, that's what I call help.
Exiting hyperspace in 10 seconds.
Launch the moment the target's acquired.
Don't wait.
Five, four, three...
- Missiles are away.
- Dart activity?
Quite a number of them.
They're moving to intercept our missiles.
Now would be a good time, Orion.
What the hell?
One of your ships has launched an attack.
Their strike inflicted damage on this hive.
Good.
The other was undamaged.
Your vessel's continuing to engage.
Are you gonna go through the play-by-play or get out of here?
This way.
- Ship's engaged in battle.
- With who?
- Doesn't matter.
- Matters to us.
- Why?
- If it's our guys our chance went back above zero, fractionally.
If it's our guys, all the more reason to damage this ship and help them.
Move it.
One missile got through, sir.
One of the Wraith ships suffered damage but the other one...
The Orion has arrived.
The hive is moving to intercept.
- They launched their weapons?
- Negative, sir.
Open a secure channel.
Major Lorne, now would be a good time to open fire.
Yes, I was thinking the same.
I gave the order, but nothing happened.
Zelenka?
I'm trying!
We're having difficulty transferring power from shields to weapons.
- There's a hive bearing on your position.
- Yes, sir.
I see.
- Stand by.
Doc, you're killing us.
- Okay.
I have it.
Firing drones.
The remaining hive is shifting their attack to Orion.
Move to intercept.
Orion has no shields.
We're not gonna make it there in time, sir.
Where are they?
I'm sorry.
They must have been taken for feeding.
No, no.
These were cut from the inside.
They escaped.
They could be anywhere on this ship.
Well, that's a start.
Why?
What could their objective possibly be?
If I know Ronon, they're somewhere they can do much damage.
And McKay would know where and how to do that, so...
There's a control station this way.
One more shot, that's all I'm asking.
I just cannot give you what I don't have.
There's too much damage.
We need to abandon ship.
- Listen to me.
- We sacrificed our shield capability for that first salvo.
This ship is going to blow any moment, major.
Caldwell, I'm afraid we've done everything we can on our end.
Request immediate beam out to Daedalus.
Get them over here.
Their operating system is a mess.
Thank goodness I remember DOS.
- Trust me, that was hilarious.
- Have you done it yet?
Look, this ship has been seriously damaged.
It's hard for me to find something to overload.
Let Mikey try.
- He's helping us.
- Where did you come from?
I latched onto the hull before it went into hyperspace.
- Nice move.
- Saw it in a movie once.
- We gotta get to the Daedalus.
- The Daedalus is here?
- We need to get to the transport.
- Why should I trust you?
Because I'm trusting you.
Because I said so.
- I don't like this.
- You got a better idea?
We take the ship on our own and leave him here.
He's the reason I'm alive now.
I don't think that's possible.
It took days to crack the Dart interface.
- This ship is bigger.
- I don't like it.
- Yeah, I get it.
You hate the Wraith.
- Him in particular.
Is there anything to boost a signal?
I wanna reach the Daedalus as soon as possible.
- Well, I could try.
- Hang on.
They'll open fire on us the second we leave the bay.
Oh, great.
The day just gets better and better.
- Sorry, sir.
We did our best.
- Nothing to apologize for.
Bring guns to bear on the Dart bays.
Hold fire till I order.
Channel every ounce of power to the forward shield until then.
I have a contact.
Single Wraith ship, possibly a transport.
Just left the hive and is on a course for us.
- It's broadcasting on our frequencies.
- What do they want?
- Maybe they want to surrender?
- Not likely.
Let's hear it.
This is Sheppard, authentication code Alpha-Seven-Tango-Three.
Please respond.
Open a channel.
Colonel Sheppard, we'd written you off.
Don't get all emotional on me now.
I've got mckay, Ronon and michael aboard a Wraith transport.
- Michael?
- Yes, sir.
He's got a plan you'll like.
It won't be long before they start shooting at us.
- The hive opened fire on the transport.
- Beam them directly to the bridge.
- Colonel.
- You said something about a plan?
I've disabled their jamming code.
It's a matter of time before they realize.
- All you have to do is send a nuke.
- We deployed all our warheads.
- The hive is launching Darts.
- Open up on those bays, all batteries.
Shut that off!
- Report.
- The plan worked, sir.
The concentrated fire on the bays created secondary explosions.
- They've stopped firing.
- Nice work, colonel.
A draw is a win for our side.
Ship status?
Shields completely depleted.
We're venting atmosphere.
Seal off all affected decks.
That last blast took out life support.
The backups aren't responding.
Right now, we're shallow-breathing.
- Meaning?
- Meaning that in under nine hours we're all gonna suffocate.
As long as we don't worry about shields and weapons we may be able to cannibalize parts from other systems in order to create a CO2 filtration system.
By the time we got that up and running the CO2 levels will overwhelm any makeshift scrubbers we concoct.
- But it's worth a try.
- Yes, but regardless we need more electricians and welders than are certified on this ship.
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who took shop needs to report to us.
- Teams assembling on every deck.
- Good, good.
Now we're talking.
How many more of these do we have?
- Twenty in total.
- How many people onboard?
In and around the 200 mark.
Buddy-breathing our way through is out of the question.
- I'm afraid so, sir.
Yes.
- Okay, fine.
They're for people working on life support.
- We need those people clear-headed.
- By " those people" ou "?
- I'll be one.
- How many levels inaccessible?
- Seven.
- We need to find out if there's pockets of atmosphere.
We may squeeze another hour from the regions sealed off.
- We can't transfer the O2 where we need.
- We could...
We'll be able to access panels closed off.
Get Sheppard in a 302.
He can eyeball it from the outside.
I'll take this.
These sections are completely open to space, Rodney.
There aren't even pockets you could beam into.
What about an EVA?
Space suits were stored in those sections.
- All right, I'm heading back.
- Copy that.
Have you tried routing from the inertial?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have tried everything.
Subspace communications?
We are floating between two galaxies, Radek.
Atlantis has no ship to send.
Even if we were able to repair the array and get a message back to Earth it would still take them weeks to get a rescue here.
I wasn't thinking of rescue.
I was thinking of telling them that we've stopped the Wraith.
Letting someone know the sacrifice we've done.
Well, a noble sentiment, but I would prefer to dedicate my last breath of air to getting more air.
Wait a second.
The only air within light years is on the Wraith ship.
There's also Wraith aboard that Wraith ship, doctor.
So we take them.
Beam an assault team in.
You would be far outnumbered.
Well, we're dead here.
I'll take my chances.
I admire your courage, colonel, but you would be dead there as surely as here.
Unless we send over the gas.
Yes, yes, yes.
That could work.
The retrovirus gas would make them virtually harmless.
- Do we still have it onboard?
- Yes, we do.
Michael's disabled their jamming codes...
- We finish the plan we started.
- We beam over the gas and wait.
We wait long enough, they won't wanna put up a fight.
They'll be humans with no memories.
I might actually survive this.
We're almost out of air.
The retrovirus takes 10 hours to run its course.
Yeah, well, we'll rotate the crew in and out of the 302s.
If this works, can you fly the hive ship?
I could.
What do you say, colonel?
Weaps, get us within beaming range of the hive.
Yes, sir.
- Anything?
- No.
No contacts yet.
Our tests of the Mark-ll generator and the chair in Antarctica are promising.
" Promising. " That doesn't sound very promising.
We're fairly confident the Ancient weapon will take care of the hive ships but doing so will probably require the last of our drones and there goes our secret weapon.
We'd really rather not have to do that.
How'd it go with the I. O. A?
Oh, you know.
I mean, does anyone ever come out of an I. O.A. Deposition saying:
" That went well" ou "?
No, I don't suppose they do.
It was what it was.
At least most of the time you're a galaxy away.
That Woolsey guy is here almost every other week.
I think they're gonna ask me to step down.
Well, if they're just gonna ask, you can always say no.
I messed this one up, general.
Yeah, you did.
I lost some of the best people...
You proceeded with the blessing of the I. O.A.
And Stargate Command, as I recall.
Somehow, that doesn't seem to help much.
Success is not final.
Failure is not fatal.
It's the courage to continue that counts.
And I think you've got that in spades.
- Churchill?
- Yeah.
Except for that last part about you.
That was all me.
- Get some sleep, Élizabeth.
- Yes, sir.
Our CO2 levels are getting dangerous, sir.
The gas has barely had a chance to run its course.
We don't have much of a choice.
We gotta go now.
Some of them are dead.
Looks like they killed each other.
What's happened?
All right.
It's all right.
Find a holding area.
Start marshaling the survivors there.
The queen's chamber should be that way.
Hello?
You all right?
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right now.
Didn't work on her.
Beckett wondered if the females would be immune.
Something you might've mentioned before she almost killed me.
- I only thought of it now.
- Colonel Sheppard.
So far we haven't run into a single Wraith, sir.
Understood.
Sheppard to Daedalus.
- Go ahead.
- You can start sending people over.
They're all human and the air is good.
I think we're out of the woods.

Three new babies are born on this earth each second,
Korea ranks number one in the world in terms of population growth,
At this pace, our population will reach 600 million in 100 years,
Unfortunately, our land doesn't expand to support this kind of growth,
We need to limit births for their better nurturing and a more economical life,
Birth control, your way out of poverty,
Presidential Blue House, 1964 Free counseling on family planning at the public clinic nearest you, starring LEE Beom-soo and kim Jung-eun
We've created an animated version to appeal to the general public.
It looks interesting and easy to understand.
Will this be shown in theaters starting this month?
Yes.
The film has been distributed to theaters nationwide.
Starting next week at the earliest...
Will this have impact when the public's understanding of family planning has hardly improved?
Population grew by 2.8% this year.
Fertility rate is 5.7 children per household.
Three years ago, it was 3% growth and 6 children.
When will we ever achieve $1,000 per capita GNP at this rate?
is it the Health Ministry's responsiblity to achieve that GNP?
The population growth is offsetting our economic growth!
More than 70% of our population live outside the city.
Do you think those 70% ever go to the movies?
He's right.
They hardly have radio or TV, much less access to a theater.
Our only option is to reach out and educate them one by one.
But who will carry out this education?
You have workers in the public clinics!
I know that!
But where's the budget?
When will you ever stop using budget as an excuse?
Use it as an excuse?
What the hell am I supposed to do when there's no money?
What did you say?
Enough!
Don't worry about the budget.
Just do it.
mission SEX CONTROL
Yongduri of Chungnam Province, 1972
Turn around.
Next!
You were here before.
Go on home!
Turn around.
Ah, the powder... I'm from Yongduri.
Who is Miss Park from Seoul?
Yongduri?
That's me.
Wow!
You are a woman and a CEO!
Wait a minute.
You look too young to be a CEO.
I'm impressed that you run your own business.
It's actually a project sponsored by the government.
The government has sent me to help improve living standards in rural areas.
A project to improve living standards?
Then, you've come for a good cause.
I'm very interested in improving my living standards.
Wait a minute.
We should hurry then.
Hang on tight.
Off we go!
Father, Suk-gu is here.
Sorry to have kept you waiting, sir.
I have brought Miss Park.
Pay your respects to the Village Chief, Miss.
Good afternoon, sir.
I am Park Hyun-joo.
Glad to make your acquaintance.
And here is the younger son of our Village Chief.
He oversees most of the business in the village himself.
Let's save the introductions for later.
Hurry, they're all waiting.
Yes, sir.
- Let's go, then.
- All right.
Good afternoon!
Good afternoon!
I've come from the Seoul Public Clinic.
I'm a family planning counselor, and my name is Park Hyun-joo.
I have invited you all to come today to help you understand what family planning is, why it is essential, and how you can implement it.
Family planning is to consider the mother's health and the family's financial status to choose the right time and interval of conception and avoid unwanted pregnancy, thereby achieving a higher standard of living.
What the hell is she saying?
I can hardly understand.
Oh, come on.
She's not speaking a foreign language.
In a nutshell, it's a campaign for a better life.
Okay?
Got it?
Yes, that's right!
In sum, family planning is a project that will raise the quality of our life.
Whoa!
Now, let us all think for a second.
Here is a family that has 1 acre of land to farm.
Let's assume that there are 5 children.
The parents work as hard as you all do, but will not be able to feed the children well.
But, what if they keep having children until there are ten instead of five?
Oh my!
The father must be mighty potent!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The kids may go hungry everyday.
is that okay?
This is why I've come to tell you how to feed those children so that they don't go hungry.
Now, to feed our children what must we do?
Young lady!
Will you please get to the point?
I might die waiting!
- Yeah, tell us!
- Tell us!
The way to do this... is to... not... have any children.
What?
What is she saying?
is she telling us to stop having sex?
Hey, you said this was for a better quality of life!
You'll probably ask how you can stop having children when conception naturally takes place?
Simple.
You prevent it.
Now, I'll talk about some contraceptive methods...
You saying we shouldn't have children?
I've never heard of such a thing!
- We can prevent conception by...
- Village Chief!
Did you gather us here to listen to this nonsense?
Can you believe this?
Does this make sense?
Mr. Kang!
The leaflets, sir!
Mr. Chief!
This is a government initiative!
Well, I'm not sure whether it really is.
Of course not!
Now get lost!
God, not have any children!
- Sir.
- Are't you afraid of God?
Sir, please be calm...
What's all this crap!
Shoo!
Shoo!
You witch!
Shoo!
You evil sprit!
Shoo!
Get lost!
You devil!
I've never heard such nonsense in my whole life!
Just have two girls, did you say?
Then, who will hold the ancestral rites?
My little baby here is cursed because of you!
Please!
Wait!
Just a moment!
Listen to me.
Do listen to me for a minute.
This is a government initiative!
Suk-gu!
Mr. Byun Suk-gu!
Please hear me out.
I understood what you said, Miss.
What?
You came back just like that?
Yes, but you see... lf it were that easy why would we have asked for you to come all the way from Seoul?
You should visit each household.
Talk to them one by one.
Okay?
Yes, sir.
Losing stuff and all from the very first day.
Hold it.
You have to tie it real tight to get a good color.
Done!
Mom, I tied my hair with this.
You look so pretty!
Ah, a balloon!
Didn't know my little boy could make such a big balloon!
Yikes!
I'm next!
No, I am!
What are you all doing?
My head is ready to burst, and you don't even worry about how much rice we've got left.
What did I do?
Are you a child?
No, you're a grown-up.
And look at yourself!
What an example you set for the kids!
Get rid of it!
Alright.
Alright.
Damm it.
Dad!
Wanna go for a swim?
Yeah, just drive me nuts.
This is what's called a birth control pill.
This is for your wife.
One pill a day.
You're so pretty, Miss Park.
- Are you single?
- Yes.
You said you have a girl and a boy, is that right?
Yeah.
By the way, you got a boyfriend?
No, I don't.
is there anything for men?
I was just getting to that.
Now, look here.
This in the picture is this one.
It's called a condom.
The leaflet provides detailed explanation on how to use it.
Whenever you and your wife do it, you put this on your you-know-what.
I don't know what.
You know, 'it'.
C'mon, I don't know what you're talking about.
Your pecker.
Pecker?
On this?
No, not that pecker.
Out with it.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, come on.
No beating around the bush.
Where?
Where do I put it?
I wonder where?
Your thing that pees.
You mean this pecker?
Yep, that pecker.
Do we have a visitor?
Hello, ma'am.
Who are you?
Mother!
It's you!
You, on that day!
Yes, your son wanted to learn about methods of birth control.
What?
You bastard!
You haven't even got married yet!
He's single?
Why do you want to learn about birth control!
Drunk already in broad daylight!
Shame on you!
So you don't careful die with no descendants?
You good-for-nothing!
What?
You've spent an entire day and no progress again?
Of course the young couples are out working in the daytime.
Do you expect me to explain every little thing?
No, sir.
There are more than 20,000 occupations in Korea.
Excuse me?
I'm just saying one's aptitude is very important.
What time was that last train to Seoul?
Beans!
Poppin'!
Go on!
Beans!
Poppin'!
Go on!
Beans!
Poppin'!
Go on!
Hey!
What are you doing?
Hello!
What are you doing, Miss?
You shouldn't!
I'll do the beans on this side.
I want to help.
You really wanna help?
Yes, of course!
You call this help?
The beans are all crushed!
And you say you're helping?
Go, lady.
Go, go, go.
- l just wanted to help.
- Help what?
Go on.
And I do have some things to tell you about!
Don't you come over here.
The government has sent me for your own good!
Yeah, that damn government.
I wish it would just let me be.
Don't you want to be really rich?
Don't you want to have a happy better life?
Hello, ladies.
Hello.
Hello.
Smells wonderful!
I see you're making rice cakes.
Oh, hello.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I am.
Really?
Wow, it looks real tasty.
May I have a... about of course not.
Well, I didn't really want any...
Would you like me to help you?
You must be tired.
May I help you with that?
Wanna try?
Yes, I do!
Aren't you gonna beat it?
Yeah, I'll start now.
After the dough's all dry?
Step aside.
You'll ruin it.
I'm talking a swing now.
Here it goes!
Oh my!
Yesterday, she hammered my wife's head as if it were the rice cake.
Really?
She's supposed to have studied in a university in Seoul!
And the things she does!
Yeah, I know.
It doesn't make any sense.
You don't get rich by not having kids.
Raising children is the best enterprise.
Don't you agree, Suk-gu?
Huh?
Hey, what were you thinking about all this time?
It's the end of the month.
I promise I'll pay you back in full next month.
Put it back in your pocket.
That would I do with so little money?
But still.
- Are you busy?
- No.
Why?
Need me to do something?
How about shining my shoe?
Why?
Don't want to?
A shoe's gotta be spick and span!
Especially for you 'cuz you're the best-dresser in town!
You can't wear dirty shoes!
Master!
You gotta look good for people.
You have a visitor, sir.
Help yourself.
Thank you, sir.
I hear that all the villagers really look up to you, sir.
With family planning,
The people in this village can be free from poverty.
But no one even tries to listen to me.
If you can just say, "Let's hear what she has to say."
Then, the people will listen.
Please help me, sir.
Are you asking me to be a beast?
Remembering our ancestors and bearing children to continue the family is our duty, which you tell them not to.
Isn't that the same as telling us to live as beasts?
No, sir.
That is not it.
The government is trying to help you live in dignity and wealth.
Such a life is impossible with four or five kids, Mr. Kang.
Miss Park, are you married?
No, sir.
Not yet.
Okay, so if you do get married, how many kids will you have?
Whether a boy or a girl, just two.
So many?
Why not have no children?
Then, you'd be even better off.
You need to have people for a country to exist.
And the family must prosper before the country can.
I hope I don't see you again in this village about this issue.
This is unheard of...
Jong-shik, the young lady is leaving!
See her off!
Go inside.
You see... ls it true that I can be rich by not having more kids?
This is really frustrating.
Why can't you understand Korean?
Listen carefully.
Allow me to start again.
The mother's health and financial status... I'll make this simple.
You see, your youngest one has three meals a day.
So how much rice is that a month?
We have only two meals.
Two?
C'mon, what've you been doing?
People eat three meals a day!
How much is that a month?
About half a bushel, no?
Yeah, about that much.
Nah, the little bastard has been eating more lately.
Well, we'll assume half a bushel.
How much is that a year?
What are you counting for?
It would be a little over 6 bushels.
Your youngest one is six.
Five years and that's 30 bushels.
With that you could've paid back Mr. Kang.
So what does this boil down to?
If you didn't have that boy of yours, you wouldn't have that debt, get it?
- ls that true?
- Yes!
Yes!
Stop eating so much!
Why'd you hit him on the head?
Now, let's all practice how to use this.
Here's the condom.
Here.
Step one.
Tear the package and take out the condom.
- Tear and take out.
- Tear and take out.
Step two!
Carefully examine to determine which side it is, in or out.
- Examine which side, in or out.
- Examine.
Step three!
Pull the tip to let the air out and put it on.
Air out and put on.
Step four!
Roll it down slowly, very slowly to the bottom.
Roll it down slowly, slowly, slowly.
Step five!
Apply lubricant.
- Apply lubricant.
- Apply lubricant.
Done!
Miss Park, why do we have to put grease on this?
Otherwise it'll be too dry.
Yes.
Oh, 'cuz it's too dry.
What are you doing?
Mine is too big for this.
Watch what you say in front of the lady.
I can't lie just because she's here.
- Yeah, big is big.
- You betcha.
What's the matter?
Why stop?
Wait a second.
I almost came.
Wait a sec.
It's almost done.
Careful!
You'll wake the kids.
I can only get one ball in.
Let me see.
I'll kill you.
Thank you.
I'll kill you.
Appreciate it.
I'll kill you...
You're so kind.
Kill you...
Come on.
Make some effort.
Kill...
How to use a condom
Man, I tried it out.
And it's not very good.
I don't know what I was doing last night.
You, too?
I still feel like somebody's pulling me by the balls.
Careful!
Here!
We have something just for such a case.
These are birth control pills.
One pill a day.
Never forget.
If you skip even for a day, it all goes to nothing, okay?
It's not as if these pills make one healthy.
We really have to take it every single day?
What are you saying?
If we can only be rich, we should even take 100 pills a day!
Right, Miss Park?
Yes.
Why'd you pinch me?
But shouldn't you be getting another box?
You do it in the daytime, too.
Things aren't as good.
Mr. Kang, I've come to congratulate you.
Happy 61st birthday!
Thank you.
Thank you.
I wish you a grandson in the near future.
I also wish you a son.
Yes, sir.
I think it's a son this time.
After 7 girls straight.
What have you been doing?
You should bear a grandson for your father.
Yeah, hurry up!
The pills are for women!
Yeah, that's right!
My husband took it for a whole month.
I hope that's all right.
Of course, don't worry.
My husband took 10 pills at once and he was fine.
If you think about it, men are a bit stupid.
Stupid.
So stupid.
What's so funny?
Oh, nothing really.
You look so pretty today.
Sister, still no sign?
Excuse me?
I'm asking is there any sign?
No, not yet.
You're a daughter-in-law of the head family.
And you've only born one girl.
It's father's 61st birthday and there is no grandson.
Have you been taking that medicine I gave you?
I have.
Accident!
A major accident!
Accident!
Young-sook's mom!
What happened, Doc?
She jumped off the Maiden's Rock.
Must've been nuts.
Doctor!
Please save my grandson!
I know it's a boy this time!
My poor little boy!
My poor little boy.
What shall I do?
Mother, please!
Oh, my baby boy!
Don't cry, okay?
Your mother will be alright.
Don't cry.
When I had my youngest one, I really thought it was a boy.
The baby was stronger in the womb.
So I thought, 'lt must be a boy.'
But it was a girl again.
The heavens have been unkind.
Anyhow, this is how I ended up with 7 girls straight.
With each girl grew our debt to Mr. Kang.
This here is Maiden's Rock.
Actually, more married mothers jumped off this rock than maidens.
Long ago a maiden with a child jumped off it and people named it that.
It's famous in these parts 'cuz only the baby would be rid off, and the mother would survive.
Have other women...?
I don't know for sure.
But I bet everyone older than me has been here at least once.
I have no regrets.
Even if she were born, it would only be a life of misery.
It's better this way than have her live in starvation like me.
I did the right thing.
No doubt about it.
But the people did not believe him.
So he was subject to dire persecution.
But Galileo Galilei insisted that the earth revolves around the sun.
Why do you think he did it?
Why did he?
Yeah, I'll be darned.
Wonder why?
Right?
Your noodles are going soggy.
Why aren't you eating, Miss?
Help yourself, Mr. Byun.
I'm not hungry.
But still, it would be a waste.
We shouldn't have ordered 3 dishes.
Please listen to me as you eat.
He did it because people need to know the truth.
If it weren't for Galileo Galilei, we may all be believing that it is the sun turning around the earth.
How about now?
Which turns around which?
You're turning my brain, that's what.
Haven't you been listening?
So it seems that the Gal siblings in Italy did something great for humanity.
Right?
The Gal siblings, well, it's actually Galileo who...
Yes.
I'm saying I want you two to be the Gal siblings in this village.
But we're a couple.
Let's go to bed.
I have to finish this coat for Father.
You know Father wants a grandson, more than that coat.
This is your wife's pot of honey.
She's been eating in secret.
Menstrual period!
Very good.
We learned a lot today.
Now do you understand how a child is conceived and how to avoid it?
Yes!
Really?
Yes!
Does anyone have a question?
I do!
Yes?
When do I put that thing on?
C'mon, you still don't get it?
Now listen carefully.
You turn off the light, and you know, to do it.
And you get kinda tense and good and your cock gets up like so.
It's okay.
Just then, you say 'Wait!
' and put the condom on.
And when you're at it you know like so...
Yes!
Yes!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey!
Hold on.
Honey!
Honey!
And it's done!
I haven't counted but, say, your 300 million tadpoles are safe inside the condom.
Right?
Yes.
But that doesn't work for me.
Mine gets up real quick and I don't have time to put it on.
Then I go "Honey, Honey, Oh Honey,"
and those 300 million tadpoles are out of the bag.
If it gets up and dies so quick, I doubt there'll be so many.
Maybe a couple.
Shut up, you bastard!
No, I know nothing about this.
Honest, sir.
Yes, it's true that we gathered at my house at night.
It was those noodles!
Miss Park told us to be those Gal siblings.
Enough!
No more out of you!
I told you I don't want to see you again.
Want to ruin my family?
It's my fault, Father.
It's my fault.
Miss Park is not to blame.
I asked her for the pills.
The head daughter-in-law must continue our lineage!
What?
You've only born a girl and now won't produce an heir?
Think you could fool us all and live in peace?
Father, please forgive me.
I have done wrong.
Sir, did you ever stop to think why she chose to use birth control?
When she had her first child, she thought she would die.
She fainted many times and spent 32 hours in labor before she finally gave birth.
And after that, she had two miscarriages.
Imagine how scared she must've been about having another child.
Creating a new life takes such pain and suffering.
And to cut off our lineage because of that!
Why do you say that?
You have a granddaughter!
Please, quiet down, everyone!
Those in the back, sit down!
Everyone had dinner I hope?
Yes!
I've asked you all to come to talk about how strange things are occurring in this village lately.
ven if it is a State initiative we must not comply with what is wrong.
I hear the young ones gather each night, conspiring foolishly for a trivial gain.
I ask the elders to counsel and correct them.
As the village chief, I shall not tolerate any more of this.
Where in the world have you all been gathering these nights?
Huh?
What was that about?
Mr. Kang's daughter-in-law took the pills.
Pills?
Attention please, everyone!
Our junior head of village would also like to speak!
I have only a small thing to announce.
As of today, Soo-chul's family cannot farm our plot.
- Soo-chul's family?
- That means...
Mr. Byun is well aware of the reason.
I just wanted to announce this for your information.
You're still home?
Honey!
See this?
It's saying, 'l need money.'
Tada!
Sew it.
Couldn't you just get me a new one?
Look!
Put that thing away from me!
How could you?
What now?
Tuition!
Not today.
Just go.
But Mom, you promised me by today.
Dad will give you more next time.
So just go today.
Yeah, right!
When will that be?
If you don't, I'm not going!
Get up.
Get up!
If I go empty-handed again, I have to stand in a corner holding a chair over my head!
is that such a big deal?
If it's what it takes to study,
You should be ready to hold up a rock if not a chair!
Get up!
Go to school!
You don't know anything!
You haven't been to school yourself!
You little brat!
How dare you talk back to me like that?
Stop!
You'll hurt him!
Who taught you to be disrespectful!
Don't send him to school!
Have some more.
I'm full.
Just finish that much.
I heard Seok-won's wife bore a son after eating that.
What brings you here?
Are you here to eat?
Alone?
Chang-su!
Get on, okay?
Chang-su, hurry and hop on!
Captain, where to?
To home?
Okay, I'm off!
Hey!
Hold on tight.
I'm going to make a real dash, okay?
What are you trying to do?
Chang-su.
You loved to play the captain when we were young.
How about reminiscing the old days?
Hurry and mount!
It's alright!
Are you nuts?
Get up.
Let's go.
Chang-su!
Forgive me this once!
I'll never do it again!
If I don't farm your plots, my family will die of hunger.
I don't care about me!
It's okay if I die.
But my wife and the little kids.
I'm begging you for them.
Please, I'm begging for them.
I'll never ever do it again!
I'll do everything you say!
Look, I'm begging you.
Please, Chang-su.
If I consider our old friendship, I shouldn't have been so harsh.
I'm sorry.
Get up now.
Thank you, Chang-su!
I will never forget this!
Thank you so much!
I, too, didn't feel so comfortable about it.
But you know this time, we need to set an example.
So I can't help you.
Chang-su...
How much is it?
Lack of education.
From lower class?
I'm sorry for asking this so many times, but could I really put it this way?
Okay, I got it.
Thanks, I think I can do the rest.
When I go back to Seoul, I'll buy you lunch.
Alright, thanks.
Bye.
Lower class...
Mr. Byun!
Please, help me.
You've got some nerve.
What more help do you need from me?
You dare ask me for more after seeing me get ruined for helping you?
Yes, I dare to, Mr. Village Chief.
Who are you kidding?
Village what?
Village Chief of Yongduri!
I've recommended you.
Because you'll work harder than anyone for the village.
You'll get me kicked out with this nonsense!
I'm already branded a troublemaker, and my family will starve soon!
But a Village Chief gets a salary.
Every single month.
Letter of appointment.
Name of village, Yongduri.
Name of appointee, Byun Suk-gu.
The above person is appointed as the Chief of Yongduri.
Dated September 9, 1972.
Authorized by Goh Gyeong-ju, Chief of Jungsan County.
I have high expectations, Chief Byun.
Congratulations, Mr. Chief and Mrs. Chief.
- Don't, you're embarrassing me.
- Really, don't.
You've become the Village Chief.
Shall we celebrate with a movie?
A movie?
Are you serious?
Yes!
Silver bell, golden bell,
Jingle, jingle
Two kids for our home
Happy, happy
Laughing all the time
There's Chang-su.
I wish we can soon have a grandson, like in that family photo.
Thanks to you, the villagers had the luxury of watching a film.
Wasn't it interesting and fun?
Isn't that what a movie's about?
I can go home from here.
No, we're almost there.
I'll see you home and take the alley.
Shall we run?
Help!
Help!
is there anyone?
Seoul lady, get lost!
Miss Park.
Do you know who I am?
I'm the Village Chief...
Who are you people!
Can't you tell?
I'm a thug.
So what?
Trying to scare me?
Trying to scare me, you bitch?
Now do you know why you got beat up?
Next time, you die.
Be good.
It's Chang-su.
I'm sorry I brought this upon you.
Sorry about what?
Ever since I met you, each day is so exciting.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Let's disinfect that wound.
I'm fine.
Turn your head a bit.
Don't cry.
I won't stop here.
Just watch me.
I'm going to make this village a prosperous one.
Yongduri of Chungnam Province.
I will make it a wealthy village.
Yes, please do.
Especially No. 33 of Yongduri.
My home, I mean.
Okay.
Miss Park!
Miss Park!
The President is coming!
Be seated.
What is it?
Quarter 3 progress report, Mr. President.
Let's cut the formalities.
Yes, Mr. President.
Are you having any difficulties?
The President?
Who are you?
I am from Byunduri...
Chief Yong Suk-gu!
I was just informed, and had to take a bicycle...
What happened to your face?
Hey, you.
From Byunduri!
Chief of Byun, no Yongduri.
The name is Byun Suk-gu!
I asked what happened to your face?
Chief of Yongduri got hurt, sir!
Yongduri?
That sounds familiar.
Where's the family planning counselor of Yongduri?
Here!
Me, Mr. President.
I am Yongduri...
Did you two fight?
No, sir.
Secretary.
Yes, Mr. President.
What are my top priorities this year?
The New Community Movement and Family Planning Initiative, sir.
And?
Yongduri ranks lowest in performance.
Chief of Yongduri!
What happened?
I was made Chief only three days ago, and I'm not quite sure, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. President!
The transition must not have been properly done.
That can't be the reason.
Give me a rational explanation.
Mr. President!
The reason is...
There is a deep-rooted preference for boys in Yongduri, and the feudalistic landowner rules the tenant farmers, I mean...
He has full control over them.
And so the performance was... lt's like that across the country.
You have to push harder!
Yes, sir!
We will use all possible means to achieve the target performance.
Any other difficulties?
Mr. President!
What is it?
Just pushing harder is okay, I suppose.
But some other method could be more effective at times.
The villagers break their backs working, yet they can't even pay back the principal, such less the interest, so they lead such hard lives.
So couldn't Mr. President first write off their debt?
Debt?
You ranked bottom and dare to make such a suggestion!
What are you standing there for?
Escort them out!
I'm not finished yet.
Get off me!
Let me speak!
Get your dirty hands off!
Mr. President!
Please hear me out, sir!
We should set the right conditions first.
Mr. President!
Please do hear me out!
What town are you from?
Sandong, Gyeongsang Province.
Sandong...
That's next to my home village.
Yes, sir.
So what more do you want to say?
Yes, sir.
It's true Yongduri is last right now.
Sir, I ask you to designate Yongduri as a test ground for family planning.
And write off all their debt.
Then what will happen?
The people will work real hard at family planning.
How hard?
Very hard... lf l cancel their debts, how far will the birth rate fall?
Mr. President!
If you cancel our debt, I pledge allegiance with all my body and soul.
What?
No child will be born in our village.
Seriously.
Yongduri became family planning pilot village
Now, how do you feel?
Are your hearts going wild?
Not just the hearts!
Now Miss Park will herself deliver this wonderful news!
The government is not giving away money but lending it.
You take this money to repay your debts.
Then after 5 years, you start paying back the principal over 10 years.
I knew you'd achieve something great some day.
It was nothing, really.
Suk-gu!
Suk-gu!
I think I'll be proud my whole life that you're my friend.
Proud of me?
I didn't do anything.
Miss Park did everything.
But at the end, since I'm the man, I nailed it nice and neat!
In my province, the girls are real tough?
so when they need to, they just 'wham' nail it.
So it was true that you're from the same town as Mr. President.
You know, I felt today that I should really respect you from now on.
Oh, I'm blushing.
Isn't it wonderful that we'll have a community center?
Personally, I wish they'd just give it out as money rather than build this building.
They're not building it 'cuz they like us.
It's to make us do birth control right.
That's right!
Hello!
We're all working hard, right?
- Yeah, of course!
- Yeah, of course!
This is a State project, gentlemen.
As proud citizens of this country let us work as one.
Suk-gu, have a glass.
No liquor!
Work!
I'm taking this.
Men, let's put our hearts into this.
Yeah, of course!
Thank you, everyone.
Mr. Chief!
But Suk-gu, you know.
I'm saying this just in case.
What if Mr. Kang's daughter-in-law bears a child?
Don't you worry.
I have a plan.
I knew it!
You have a plan!
What's worrying you?
Are people not listening to you?
Who is it?
That's not the issue.
Then what's the matter?
I've made a promise to Mr. President.
And what's that?
I promised to tie them.
Wait!
Doctor, it'll work later, right?
Don't worry.
Really?
Yeah!
Now, I'll begin.
Yes.
Wait!
Sorry, I'm just curious.
I can grow a moustache, right?
Now what?
Couldn't I step out for a sec to pee?
Mommy...
Mr. Byun!
Are you all right?
What's wrong?
It hurts.
Oh, goodness.
Good work.
What is this?
A subsidy from the government.
We get money for this?
Yes.
Mr. Byun, you should rest a little before you go home.
I'll be fine.
Wait, I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah, sure.
Take care.
Take your time.
It's not cooked yet.
Let it cook first.
It'll cook inside my stomach.
Don't you know that?
Yeah, yeah.
Boy, feasting on the money I got for tying my balls.
Hey, what brings you here?
Good evening!
I see you've got rich after stealing my father's place.
Yeah?
But I thought it was your place I stole.
Seems you've got something to say.
Have a seat.
Can't say it in front of the kids.
Let's talk outside.
Sorry, but I have a reason for not getting up.
So you can say it here.
Don't provoke me.
There is a limit to my patience.
Not sure what you mean by that.
Don't go around inciting people, and putting ideas into their heads.
I don't have to incite.
They're all so eager.
I'm warning you.
If you don't stop here, you're all losing your land.
Yeah, sure.
By the way, do you know how to farm?
Community Center
Going to just sit there, Father?
I can't let them do this.
I'll take care of it.
Chang-su.
Go and get Suk-gu.
Help yourself.
Tell everyone to start working.
So does that mean you accept our campaign from now on?
I have no choice.
Can't ruin a year's farming.
All right, sir.
But there is a condition.
We'll get to work only if your family bears no child for a year.
How'd you come up with such a brilliant idea?
It was nothing.
Nothing at all.
Suk-gu, you're the best!
Not 'Suk-gu', 'Mr.
Byun, Village Chief!
Yeah!
Mr. Byun the Chief is the best!
- Sure!
Mr. Byun the Chief is the best!
- Sure!
He is the best!
Look here.
It's so white like your fair skin, Miss Park.
You're tanned on the outside,
But I bet you have very fair skin underneath.
Think so?
Well, I must confess, as a maiden I did make quite a few hearts beat faster.
Yeah, a little flattery and you're off.
And of those hearts Bok-man's beat the fastest.
What did you say?
My husband?
You're at it again.
You should make kimchi with your hands not your mouths!
Sorry, craved for something spicy.
Maybe I'm pregnant or something.
What are you saying?
I did as I was told!
What?
You did it like that?
Oh my, where did you... I don't believe this.
I can't believe you're so stupid!
You make me shudder!
You're not a friend, damn it!
Get lost, you idiot!
But I greased it, too!
Suk-gu, do you have to do this?
You wanna turn everything back to like it was before?
Why do you speak without thinking?
That dumb bastard.
It's his fate.
I've come to see Miss Park.
Yes, I'm here.
What is it, ma'am?
You see, Miss Park.
A few days ago, I took off the condom just once because it wasn't any good.
What!
What did you say?
You out of your mind?
How could you take it off?
But it isn't any good with it on.
Don't you know what'll happen if you keep it off?
Good is not the issue!
When I put it on it's too painful!
- Me, too!
- l bleed.
Your attention, please.
From today on, you take your pill before going to bed.
And mark each day on the calendar like so.
Miss Park.
I have to wrestle with the kids to put them to bed, so I'd very likely forget.
In that case, take your pill before breakfast, and mark the calendar.
Before breakfast?
In the morning, it's practically a war.
We won't remember.
Yeah, it's very hard!
Then, what do you want me to do?
- How about a surgery?
- How about a surgery?
- Surgery?
- Surgery?
What?
Will it work?
It will work, and you still get a moustache.
And it won't hurt.
So, lay down.
Relax.
You're Bong-ku's mom.
Gye-soon's mom.
Mommy!
Gwang-ja's mom.
Condom!
Birth control pills!
Condom!
Birth control pills!
Condom!
Kim Bok-man.
Next!
Next.
What?
You have to stand out, don't you?
- Good.
- Next!
Next!
Good.
Next!
Why did you skip a day?
It just happened.
If you skip your pills, you are at serious risk.
From today on, you should put the condom on your husband, and get Mr. Byun to confirm it, okay?
Yes.
You are the best, Miss Park!
Fellow citizens, you are the pride of our county, and the Chungchung province.
You've become the Family Planning pilot village just 3 months ago, and ranked first.
And I thank you for your efforts to achieve so much.
As a token of appreciation and encouragement, the Minister of Health has sent a television!
Now, we should give a round of applause to Village Chief Mr. Byun and to Counselor Park!
Please step forward!
Now, applaud!
How about a round of cheers!
Hurrah!
Hurrah!

- Really, I can't.
- Point like so!
Point!
Point!
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
Saw your underwear!
What've you just done to Miss Park?
Stop right there!
What's going on?
Can everyone hear me fine?
I'm sorry to interrupt your party.
But there is something I must share with you.
Letter of appeal!
Your Excellency the Governor.
When I first came to Yongduri Village, I found the people living in abject poverty and ignorance.
Their standard of living was subhuman.
The unenlightened villagers were only concerned about making another day's living.
And even the few who are aware of the importance of family planning were obstructed by the village chief.
It's rather long so I will skip some parts.
Therefore, a new village chief should be an uneducated lower classman, who can easily approach the villagers.
This would be far more effective.
Please look upon the poor and destitute villagers of Yongduri with kindness.
Yours Sincerely, Park Hyun-joo, Family Planning Counselor.
Now do you see why I came to share this with you?
lgnorant and unenlightened?
Why do we have to bear such insult?
No, that's not it!
Please!
Give me a minute and I'll explain everything.
Listen.
It was the first time I'd written a Letter of Appeal.
To persuade the people up there, you have to write it like that.
Alright!
Alright!
Okay, let's assume that is true!
But what's this then?
Resume!
Name, Park Hyun-joo!
Born in 1947.
In Gyeongbuk Province,
Sangbongri of Okju, Sangdong County.
Graduated from Sangbong Grade School in 1960.
Graduated from Okju Girls' Junior High School in 63.
What's this?
Did she not finish her resume?
What's wrong?
I feel a bit nauseous.
Miss Park, you didn't even go to high school?
What are you doing when we're here to celebrate?
Why are you slandering her?
Slander?
Mr. Lower Class Village Chief, sir!
Are you saying that I'm making this up?
Look here.
Take a good look!
Everyone, take a look.
She's written this herself.
Come on and look.
Just see for yourself.
I'm completely sober, and still I feel nauseous.
Don't worry.
It's probably some roundworms.
Don't make a fuss.
Give her a strong medicine to kill the worms.
Why do you think she lied to us?
She explained she was ordered to from the top.
What if she had admitted to finishing only junior high?
Just think, alright?
People listened to her 'cuz we thought she went to a big college.
But she shouldn't have lied to us.
We're the closest...
We are what?
We're no different!
We're villagers like everyone else!
Just be quiet.
- Still.
- Be quiet!
Mr. Byun Suk-gu!
- Pregnant?
- Yeah!
Come on, doctor.
I've had that vasectomy thing.
You performed it yourself.
I'm a watermelon without seeds.
How could she get pregnant?
I dunno.
Maybe someone else's seeds?
How should I know?
Yes!
Give me another!
I won't play!
Play with me.
- No!
- No!
Play with me!
- We said no!
- We said no!
Eat your dinner.
Hurry and eat.
Aren't you gonna eat, Mom?
I have no appetite.
You all eat plenty, though.
Chew well before swallowing.
Here.
It is so rare that we go to town, it would've been nice if we'd eaten out for once.
What's wrong with me?
What's gotten into you?
Are you mad?
All of you out.
Why are you doing this to the kids?
Get out!
What's the matter?
Am I going to die from a disease?
is that why you're acting like this?
You're pregnant.
Who is?
Me?
You had that vasect thing or whatever.
I can't be pregnant.
Who is it?
Honey!
What's that supposed to mean?
So you think I...?
What nonsense.
Oh, goodness.
What a waste of food.
And you scared the kids for nothing.
I think you've got something wrong.
We'll go tomorrow and check things out again.
Let's have the kids eat first.
I should go to Bok-man's.
See if they have some cold rice left.
Mom, where's the rice?
Wait a sec.
I'll bring some soon.
Yeah, Mommy. I'm starving.
- l know.
- Me, too.
Where's the umbrell...
Father, stop it!
You're gonna kill Mommy!
What do you want to see Bok-man for?
Huh?
Now that you're caught, you wanna run off with him, huh?
No, that's not true!
Then, who is it?
Who is it?
You think I'm a fool?
I saw you and him laughing and dancing together.
I know it all!
I know it all!
- Let go of me...
- Since when?
Say it!
No!
I'm innocent!
Why are you doing this to me?
How else can you be pregnant?
How else!
It's either you or me.
One of us dies, got it?
There's no other way to end this.
Who is it?
Honey?
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Who is it?
Stop talking nonsense and come here, please!
No.
I can't face the villagers anyhow.
I've kicked out Duk-pal myself.
Everyday I've been grilling people not to screw up.
And my own wife pregnant by another man?
Yeah, I should die.
I'll solve it by killing myself.
Stop!
Okay!
Okay!
It's Bok-man.
Satisfied?
What is it?
What's wrong with you?
You nuts?
Son of a bitch!
Suk-gu!
Do you really think I did that?
Oh, please!
Stop beating him!
You'll kill my husband!
Oh, my goodness!
What happened?
He thinks I slept with his wife!
- What?
- Yes?
He's saying his wife's got my child!
That crazy bastard!
What the hell are you saying?
What's this?
You see...
You see, your tubes came untied.
What?
Father!
Did you see anything up there?
We've searched everywhere, from the top of the river and down.
Wait!
Wait!
What's that over there?
Where?
Over there!
Isn't that Suk-gu's wife?
- What?
- Where?
Where?
Soo-ni!
Soo-ni!
You bastard!
You said it was another man's seed!
Spit it out!
Say it!
Chief Byun!
- Why can't you spit it out?
- Please stop this, Chief Byun!
Why can't you open up that stuck-up mouth of yours!
Let go of me!
Let go!
Ouch, my back.
How about a drink?
I'm really sorry about what happened.
I sincerely apologize.
Even doctors are never perfect, so we can make mistakes, too.
Anyway, I just wanted to say that for both your sake and this village's I hope that this event doesn't get out.
Think about it.
The villagers already feel uneasy with that Counselor Park here.
So by adding this to it, think of the consequences.
Well, just thinking about your wife, it really tears my heart, too.
But still, by revealing the truth it won't help bring someone back to life, you know.
We can't hold a funeral 'cuz we haven't found the body yet.
Chief Byun must be devastated.
You know, maybe she might've run off with another man.
What are you talking about?
Just think!
It's not so easy to take one's own life.
Maybe she disguised it as a suicide and eloped with a lover.
The way you think disgusts me.
Anyways, how are the kids?
Yeah.
Miss Park is probably taking good care of them.
Miss Park, my ass.
I hope she's feeding them alright.
What are you getting at?
Nothing.
That Miss Park doesn't seem right.
What's not right?
You shouldn't talk like that!
Can't help it if I have these doubts about that woman.
What's wrong with Miss Park?
What doubts are you talking about?
Look here!
Why get angry at me?
What are you, Miss Park's lover?
I'm not anything!
Damn it!
What a loser.
That's called love.
Father.
Yes.
I've asked for what's best for pregnant women.
Well done.
Have it prepared with care.
Yes, father!
Father.
I've said all I had to say.
- Mr. Chief!
- Mr. Chief!
Mr. Chief!
This place is a mess.
I see you're still here.
Where's Chief Byun?
He's gone out for a minute.
Mr. Kang's daughter-in-law is pregnant!
You know the herbal medicine for the pregnant.
That medicine is now in that house!
I knew it!
I told you I had doubts!
Now what are you gonna do?
Huh?
What do you mean?
Just what I said.
You've broken our pact so you move out.
Duk-pal had to leave for the same reason.
You know this, don't you?
What?
Chang-su!
What if we don't?
Can't you stand seeing things go well for us for once?
Of course you can't.
You want us to work your land like little insects.
To obey without a word, break our backs to pay your interest.
To come and go at your call.
To play dead if you command so.
You ungrateful bastard!
You've lived on my generosity!
Of course.
On your generosity.
Thanks to you I lived as would a dog or a pig!
So now we're trying to live for once like human beings.
But you can't take it, and want to spoil everything?
You can't see us fill our bellies with barley when you fill yours with meat?
That's what this is!
You insolent bastard!
Shut your filthy mouth!
Your family goes out, and everything's settled.
Son of a bitch!
My name is Byun Suk-gu.
Byun Suk-gu!
People call me Chief Byun, got that?
Now let me ask again.
Will you move out or not?
How dare you!
I am not moving an inch from where l am!
And here I shall see my grandson play and draw my last breath, you bastard!
Alright, clear enough.
But remember this.
We won't just sit and watch you ruin us.
Let's go!
Mr. Byun!
What are you going to do?
Now what?
Huh?
What else?
We go all the way.
Yeah, let's go.
But how do we go?
Kindap.
Kidnap?
What did you just say?
Bok-man?
Hey, you!
You want me out?
You really don't trust me?
I do trust you.
Okay, let's do it!
I can't repay all that debt even if I worked all my life.
Good!
And I wanna send my eldest to a good school in the city!
And my mother to a big hospital in Seoul!
I said from the beginning that we gotta go all the way.
- Let's get ready.
- Let's go!
No!
You can't do this.
Silver bell, golden bell
Jingle, jingle
is anybody there?
Can somebody please come?
Help me!
There is a person in here!
Please help!
Father, are you in bed?
What is it?
I have something to discuss with you.
Let's talk tomorrow.
Silver fish, golden fish, kick, kick
Who are you?
Playing masks?
What?
What did you say?
I don't quite know, sir.
I've looked everywhere, but she's gone.
We'll be back soon.
Attention!
Salute!
Eyes front!
You are my hostage tonight!
Come on.
Couldn't you untie me just for a sec?
Please, my wrists hurt so much.
lmpossible!
You low-life scoundrel!
Untie me now!
Come here, you little insect!
If I free myself, you're deadmeat!
If you go yapping again, I'm sticking this back on.
All right.
Why don't we play together?
Huh?
If you untie me, I'll play any game you want me to.
Okay, sir?
No, handsome!
Uh, Captain?
General?
Handsome?
Yes, handsome.
Handsome Chang-hyuk.
Fire!
What is that?
Look!
It's the community center!
Fire!
Miss Park's in there!
Things are getting out of hand.
Can't help it.
Bok-man, you too go down!
No, I'm with you till the end!
No, I have to finish what's been started.
I did all this alone, alright?
Now hand her over.
What on earth!
It won't be long.
It'll be over soon.
Wasn't there anyone inside?
What do you mean?
Miss Park and Chang-hyuk!
My Chang-hyuk?
Oh, no!
My son!
Careful, Father!
Mr. Byun, let's stop all this now, okay?
Let's forget about that deal with Mr. President.
Move aside.
No!
Wait!
This is not the way.
There's gotta be some other way.
What other way?
For me this is the only way.
No!
Wait!
Mr. Byun!
Wait!
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
You might kill someone!
What's changed you so much?
You are a good man.
Why can't you see that this is wrong?
Wrong?
What did I do wrong?
Huh?
That I worked hard as village chief to make everyone's life better?
Or is it wrong that I went through with that surgery like I was told to?
If not!
Or how about my wife, who died an undeserved death?
is it wrong that I can't even defend her when people call her adulteress?
is it?
How is it all my fault?
I know!
I know that now!
It's my fault!
It's all my fault!
So kill me instead, okay?
No, it's too late now.
I can't stop now.
Can't stop.
Step aside.
Mr. Byun!
- Father!
- Father!
Hold on.
Handsome!
Soo-ni?
Mommy!
- Mommy!
Mommy!
- Mommy!
Mommy!
Honey...
Honey...
We've been married for more than 10 years.
And I never for once doubted his faithfulness.
I wanted to die just then.
But I couldn't because of the kids.
I had nowhere to go,
But that house.
I went soaked in rain, and Mr. Kang received me with kindness.
is your wife all right?
Yes, sir.
And the baby?
Yes, sir.
Alright, then.
Go on.
Resignation I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.
Miss Park!
I don't believe this!
Please, make way!
Make way!
Miss Park, this way!
When I woke up this morning, this was left in front of my room.
- What does it say?
- l dunno.
Good morning, Miss Park, I apologize for leaving without saying farewell,
Miss Park, I really wanted to live a good life,
So I tried hard,
Frankly, I think family planning might give us more wealth, but I'm not so sure about happiness,
And you shouldn't worry about us,
We will live a great life,
Oh!
By the way!
If the newborn is a girl, I'm thinking of naming her after you,
We want to call her by your name to remember you forever,
Hope it's alright?
I am very grateful for all you've done, Miss Park,
Do take care,
Byun Suk-gu, Former Chief of Yongduri,
Mr. Kang, I've come to bid you farewell.
I have learned much from you.
Sir, do you remember the day when I first came here?
You asked me then,
Wouldn't you be better off if you have no children at all?
I was unable to answer you then.
But now I want to, Mr. Kang.
Like then, could you ask me the question once more?
Young lady, are you married?
No, sir.
Not yet.
But I will when I meet someone I love.
If you get married, how many children will you have?
Well, sir.
I should discuss with my husband and plan for it.
What is there to plan?
No children and you'll be better off, no?
Chang-hyuk!
No, sir.
Family planning is essential.
If it makes lives better not just on the outside, and if it's the kind that makes people happy,
then it's worth a try.
People have to be ruined for there to be the country.
The family may prosper but the country is doomed to fall.
I hope I don't see the same underwear in my village again.
Jong-shik!
Chang-su is going to Seoul.
See him off!
Hello.
Celia.
What's yours?
It's nice to meet you Donovan.
I can't.
I'm not allowed.
Hey, where'd you go?
Hey, where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where do you think you're going, little lady?
Huh?
Grandpa, I have to find him.
Find who?
The boy.
He's going to get away.
Come come say hi to mom and then you can go play.
Okay.
Come on, honey.
Okay.
Say hi to Mom.
Hi, Mommy.
Why don't you tell her all about your new tooth and how you're excited about starting volleyball practice next week.
Go on, sweetheart.
You can talk to her just like you talk to me.
I know she's listening.
Pay attention, Celia.
We're here to see your mommy.
Tell her about your week.
I don't want to.
What did you say?
I said I don't want to.
Why?
I just don't.
Honey, your mother loves you.
She loves you very much, baby.
I won't.
You can't make me.
Celia, honey!
Celia, no!
It's okay.
It's okay -- she's -- it's okay.
It's okay.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
It's okay, Grandpa.
He protected me.
He's always going to protect me.
What if I would have lost you too, huh?
Don't do that, baby.
Please.
Celia?
Out here.
One for the road.
Are you ready, yet?
Hey, you can't rush perfection.
I have to find my keys.
What would I do without you?
Sure you want to do this?
Do what?
I know what this day means.
I know how you get.
So, we don't have to go if you don't want to.
Justine, it's my 21st.
I'd like to actually enjoy my birthday for once.
Are you sure?
'Cause I'm totally fine just staying at home.
Yes.
I could use a party.
Okay then.
Let's go.
Damn.
I'm glad you didn't get caught in that on the way up here, especially in that piece of crap car.
Yeah.
Stop it.
What?
Your birthday's not cursed.
Accidents like that happen everyday up here.
I know.
I -
- I -- we'll have fun tonight.
Yo, you hotties want to be in a movie?
You wish losers.
God, aren't you glad you came up here to share this culture experience?
Hey, I wanted to do something different.
This is different.
I do my best to deliver.
Just stay away from the freshies and you should be fine.
Alright.
Well just promise not to ditch me five minutes after we get in there for some idiot.
Scout's honor.
Oh, you know what?
You'll be too busy making out with Dougie Fresh, and I'll be left alone by the kegerator.
Okay.
There's not going to be any making it, at least not by me.
Uh-huh.
You came all the way up here for a little handholding and friendly conversation.
I came all the way up here so I could be with my best friend in the whole world.
And the hot guy she promised to hook you up with.
That's really the truth.
You gonna be okay?
If you ask me that one more time I'll kill you.
Come on.
Corby!
Justine!
Hey, you made it.
Hi.
Follow me.
This is Celia, my friend from San Diego.
Pleasure to meet you pretty lady.
Hi.
Can my boy Terry here offer you a cocktail?
You two should try the Famous Terry-bomb.
What?
One shot from each bottle.
What?
One shot from each bottle.
Oh, just beers please.
I want a Terry-bomb.
So, where's Doug?
I want him to meet Celia.
He's upstairs.
You're going to like him, really.
Let's see if he's in here.
Doug?
Alright, ladies?
Are you sure?
Cool.
Alright.
What's up, brother?
Hey, you seen Doug around?
No.
I haven't seen him since Jell-O shots.
Wow, you and your fine companions care to join us for a little other worldly excitement?
Yeah.
What are we in, third grade?
Hey now.
You dare mock the great Ouija?
Jesus, Gopher, put that thing away.
How you doin'?
Don't listen to him.
He's really just a D and D geek under that shaved chest.
True.
Oh my god.
Who's doing that?
It's not me.
I swear.
Well, quick, grab a pen and paper.
Go home, Celia.
It didn't say that.
Who the hell's Celia?
Um, she is.
Very funny.
I didn't.
Oh please.
You cannot punk me.
Whoa, whoa, ladies.
Let the man of the house lead.
Hey, move out.
You chicas wait in here.
I'll be right back.
It's kind of weird, huh?
Stop.
I swear it wasn't me.
Whatever.
Believe what you will.
Don't trust your number one girl.
So he's kind of cute, huh?
Who?
Corby?
Uh-huh.
I think I might hook up with him tonight.
Really?
What?
You don't approve?
I'm not here to judge.
It -- it's not for sure or anything.
I mean, there might be something better out there for me.
Well, you wouldn't want to miss out.
Look who I found.
Douglas, I've been looking all over for you.
This is my friend Celia.
It's her birthday.
Oh yeah?
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Am I allowed to ask the number?
The big two one.
Nice.
Well, we'll have to make tonight special then.
Oh, thanks.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why?
You just seemed a little --
I don't know -- distant back there.
No, I'm sorry.
Thanks for getting me this.
It's no place for a girl over there right now.
Naked keg stands.
No place for a guy either really.
So where's your girl?
She ditched me for a meathead.
Predictable.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
What was that?
What?
Nothing.
It was probably the music.
Come on.
You guys have a make out room?
Of course.
What kind of frat house would this be without one?
I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself there, buddy.
No.
Over here.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
You'll see.
Come on.
What is this?
This was an old wine cellar back in the day, back before this was a fraternity.
It's probably like hundreds of years old.
Cool.
Yeah.
I like to come down here and think about like who came through that door, you know, what they talked about, what they drank.
I guess that makes me kind of a huge geek, huh?
No.
No.
I think it's really cute.
There it is.
What?
That look.
Why are you so sad?
It's your birthday.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I -
- I don't -- I didn't mean to.
It's okay.
You can tell me.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
It's not even a secret really.
Uh.
Uh, I really hoped that this wouldn't affect me this year.
But birthdays have never really been great for me.
Well, my mom died on my birthday.
She actually died giving birth to me.
So every year my birthday's kind of like a reminder that I killed her.
Shit, that -- that's rough.
Yeah.
And apparently my dad hit the bottle and disappeared so I was raised by my grandparents.
Which was great.
I mean, my grandpa was so amazing,
but he died last year, so.
I -
- I just really miss him.
No doubt, mm.
Every year I would spend my birthday with him, and he loved my mom so much.
But he would always remember to remind me that her death wasn't my fault.
That's -- that's some heavy shit.
And it was 21 years ago.
And I never even knew her.
Still it's hard to eat cake and ice cream you know.
Sure.
I'm sorry.
I'm just really sorry.
It's like baggage central.
Like I don't even know why I'm talking to you about this.
Let's not talk.
What's wrong?
I just heard it again.
What?
I feel really weird.
I need to get out of here.
I need to get some air.
Wait, don't go.
Seriously, I'm not feeling --
What did you do?
Come on, Celia.
Just relax.
Come on, man.
Hurry it up.
Hey, what -- hey, what the hell is wrong with her?
Dude, I think she's OD'ing.
Hello?
Please!
Help me!
This isn't real.
This isn't happening.
Somebody please get me out of here.
Somebody please.
Justine.
Justine.
Anybody.
Grandpa?
Hello?
Hello?
Holy shit.
Hello?
Hello, is anyone here?
You guys come on.
If this is a joke it's really not funny.
Justine?
Justine, are you here?
Hello?
Grandpa.
Hey, little lady.
Happy Birthday.
What's going on?
It's okay, Celia.
Everything's okay now.
No, no.
No.
This s a bad dream.
Don't be scared.
You died.
Yes.
Then how
You died too.
Those boys.
Those filthy boys, but they can't hurt you know.
You're safe now.
You're safe with me.
I'm dead?
Yes.
That stuff they put in my drink.
I wanna wake up now.
This is not dream Celia.
Yes, it is.
This is terrible dream.
I'm just passed out somewhere and I'm gonna wake up.
I know how you're feeling.
I'm not dead.
This is crazy.
I don't have time to explain it all.
You have to get out of this house.
Why?
Listen to me, Celia.
Do as I say and nothing bad will happen.
But, please, we've gotta go.
You cannot stay here.
Okay.
Quickly.
Where are we?
What is this place?
Stay with me and you'll find out.
Celia, you must go.
You must get out.
I will meet you out there.
Where are you going?
Don't leave me.
I promise you I will find you.
Go.
Whatever you do don't look back.
Run.
What the hell?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Grandpa?
No!
Go back to the house, Celia.
Who is that?
Go back to the house, Celia.
It's the only way.
Who's there?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Celia, sweetheart.
Come on, let's go.
Go away.
It's okay.
What is this?
Where am I?
It will all be over soon.
What do you mean?
Help.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Hello, Celia.
Stay away from me.
It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay back.
Get away.
Celia.
Stop calling me that.
You don't know me.
I don't know what you guys put in my drink.
I'm not one those guys, and this isn't some bad trip.
I'm not dead.
Don't you tell me that I'm dead.
Look, I know you've had a tough night, you're upset.
So let's just calm down and talk about this, okay?
Calm down?
Just invite me in.
I'll explain everything to you.
Oh yeah, sure.
Come in so you can just kill me.
That's not why I'm here.
Now do you remember me?
Oh my god.
I'm your friend, Celia, and I always have been.
Hello.
Hello.
What's your name?
Celia.
What's yours?
They call me Donovan.
Nice to meet you Donovan.
Can you come and play Celia?
I can't.
I am not allowed.
Don't worry.
I am here to protect you.
I am always going to protect you Celia.
The cemetery.
You saved me from that car.
And countless other times I might add.
So what are you?
Like my guardian angel?
Not exactly.
I died too just like you.
I was only eight at the time so I understand how scared you must be.
This might be easier to explain if I wasn't out here freezing my ass off.
Well, if you think you're coming in here you're out of your mind.
Well we don't have a lot of time.
Two hours give or take.
Come two A.M. it's lights out.
And then I suppose I turn into a pumpkin.
No.
Then you become completely vulnerable to these nasty things out here.
So I'd can the sarcasm because I'm trying to help you.
I'm not letting you in here just so you can turn into one of those crazy psycho demon things like my grandfather just did.
You see, that wasn't your grandfather.
It was the soul eater that ate him, so now he can appear, act and sound like your grandfather.
This is crazy.
So you're telling me is that
I wasn't only raped and murdered tonight but but that my grandfather was eaten by one of those things?
I don't know what to believe.
Well, do you believe I am who I say I am?
Yes I do.
Well, that's enough for the time being.
Let me in.
It's not locked.
You actually have to invite me in.
You see, this white light around is called your sanctuary.
People can't come in your sanctuary unless you invite them.
And, once in, they can't touch you unless you touch tme first.
So, don't touch them.
That would be bad..
Okay.
Come in.
Come with me.
I have something to show you.
Shit.
Wait.
Hey.
Well, come on.
I'm not going out there.
I'm not really good with heights.
You're already dead.
Are you really afraid of falling?
Take a look.
We're the only ones here.
Exactly.
It's just you and me now.
That's why you gotta stick by me.
Wait, I just saw something.
Look, what is that?
That is a soul eater
What?
A soul eater is exactly as it sounds.
It needs to feed constantly or else it goes to hell.
They're all just waiting for the perfect moment when you step out into the light.
That's when it can attack.
You're my imaginary friend.
I must just be imagining you.
I'm as real as can be.
In fact, I'm a little offended that you stopped believing in me.
But you were the one that stopped coming around.
I haven't seen you since I was like eight.
Yeah, but I've been there the whole time.
When your grandfather, Joe, was in the hospital, or when you got drunk and crashed your grandpa's car into the dumpster.
I was there when you lost your virginity.
You were there for that?
I needed to make sure that you were paying attention.
You really never left?
Naw.
I wish I had known that.
Uh-oh.
What?
What is it?
Well, that flicker means that the light is dying.
We need to move to a place where the light is strong, fast..
Why?
What happens if it runs out?
You don't want to know.
Come on.
Let's do inside.
Celia, come on.
Hurry.
Celia.
Rachel.
Celia, help.
You've got to help me.
Oh my god.
Don't listen to her.
Something's after me.
It's trying to kill me.
She's not who she says she is, Celia.
Don't listen to him.
He can't be trusted.
He's not like you and me.
I'm your friend.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Celia, please.
You've got to help me.
I don't know .
Celia, look at me.
Do you remember?
Yes.
We came here the night I died.
It was different.
I always liked playing with you.
Yeah right.
I sucked.
You were always so much better than me.
Well, I was tougher than you.
Is that why you stuck up for me when everybody else made fun?
I knew it wasn't about you.
You were worried about someone else.
Do you remember the night my grandfather died?
That was a terrible night.
I never really thanked you.
I was all alone.
You barely knew me but you stayed with me all night.
I wouldn't have made it.
After that night we were connected weren't we?
Yeah.
I helped you then, Celia.
And now I need you to help me.
Please?
What the hell just happened to me?
Aw, gee, I don't know, genius.
Maybe it's the fact that you ignored everything I told you.
I was confused.
There's no time for confusion.
They will do whatever it takes to get into your head to get you out of the light.
You have to be smarter than them.
You have to think.
Okay.
But -- but if -- but if she if it was not Rachel then
how did it know all those personal things about me?
Because when it feeds it takes everything, memories, feelings, everything.
We have to get to the basement.
Hurry.
Now!
Try to stick by me from now on, alright?
No problem.
Hey
look.
Are you seeing this
I see everything.
It's a gift.
You'll find I have many gifts.
You can always see your old world through mirrors.
So this is what's happening right now at this exact moment?
They haven't found my body yet or else the party would be over.
Once your body leaves the sanctuary your soul goes with it.
Ten it's open season on your ass.
Come on now.
Don't start that.
I could never stand to see you cry.
I'm scared, Donovan.
It doesn't have to end this way.
I'm listening.
I'll show you.
But you're going to have to be brave, and I know that's not your strongest suite.
I guess you have been watching.
What are you doing?
This room leads to a place without soul eaters.
That's where this all started.
It's okay.
I can't.
Sure you can.
No, Donovan please, I have really bad feeling.
I've been through this a few times.
I think I might know what I'm talking about.
That place is evil.
I'm the guy who's protected you from evil your whole life.
I can't.
So you'd rather let them out there tear you to shreds?
That's what you'd rather have?
There's still more time.
Please just let me see if I can figure this thing out.
If we run out of time we can come back here.
Alright.
Thank you.
No matter what, don't look them in the eye.
She got me.
You need to cover that.
Hurry.
They're like sharks.
They smell blood, they know the source, they'll come.
Is that the right time?
Oh yeah.
We don't get much power here, but lights, clocks, that sort of thing.
It's 1:08.
If that's accurate your time is halfway gone.
What's he doing?
Isn't it obvious?
That ass hole.
Justine, no!
Now, keep your hand on the mirror.
As long as it's on the mirror you can hear everything they hear.
I cannot find her.
It's been hours.
You know what?
I think I saw her in the backyard.
Let's go.
You want to go dance or something?
I don't want to go dance.
I want to find my friend.
I don't want your beer.
I don't want your beer.
I want to find my friend.
Look I want
I don't want your beer.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Can't I just stay?
No.
It may appear that you're in this room, but it's not perspective.
It's not reality.
Stop!
They can't hear you, Celia.
I don't want beer.
I want to find Celia.
Why?
Why do you want to interrupt the magic?
She didn't just run off and get naked with Doug, okay.
She wouldn't do that.
Well, neither would you apparently.
Don't be a jerk, alright.
I just want to find Celia.
Would you stop freaking out.
She's a big girl.
I think she can take care of herself.
It's her birthday.
I don't want her to think I ditched her.
I can promise you she's not thinking about that.
Asshole.
She's off with my boy having a great time.
Auh.
No!
I tried to tell you.
I have to get back.
That's the stuff they put in my drink.
It'll kill her.
You can't affect living things anymore, Celia.
You need to understand that.
I have to help her.
It's out of your hands now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's think about this for just one second alright?
Your light is dying as we speak.
If she drinks that she creates a new sanctuary.
That gives you more light, and, plus, you two get to be together again.
I can't just let her die.
It's kind of the order of things.
Fuck you.
Hey, there's no need for the f-word.
Shh.
Seriously, baby.
Why don't we give them just like another half an hour.
I swear she's going to walk through the door with this huge smile on her face.
You clear have a lot of confidence with you friend.
My bros know how to get it done right.
Obviously.
Justine, walk away.
He's a dick.
Stop.
No.
No.
I'm going to need a lot more of this.
No!
Did you just see that?
Nice one.
Wha --
What?
We gotta go.
Hey, wait.
You lied to me.
I did not.
Yes you did.
You said I couldn't affect things.
You said there was nothing I could do.
Well, technically you can't affect living things, and that's true.
A cup of beer does not have a heartbeat.
Why would you want her to die?
Because I'm here to protect you, Celia.
We could have had her light.
We could have had her sanctuary.
Look.
I would never sacrifice my friend's life for my own.
Ever.
Well, it's that kind of thinking that's going to get you sent you know where.
Don't listen to him, Celia.
You're perfect just the way you are.
I'm very proud of you.
Don't do anything stupid here, Celia.
Shut up.
He's one of them.
Well, then how is he in my sanctuary?
He was in the living room.
He was in the light.
I was talking to him.
I don't know because you called him, let him in.
Fortunately for you he can't come back without another invitation.
Don't listen to him, Celia.
Listen to me.
He is not your grandfather.
I know that.
But there's a part of him that is still in there, isn't there?
I'm here, and you can be with me.
Listen to me, Celia.
I can take you to your mother.
I know she wants to meet you.
Yes.
Celia.
Just look at me, Celia.
Look at me.
It's okay.
You can go.
Mom?
I can't believe you're standing here.
I don't know where to start.
I know most of it anyway.
I've watched you your whole life.
You're so beautiful.
So are you.
More than any of the pictures.
I'm so sorry, Mom.
I'm so sorry.
You have to stop blaming yourself.
Please.
You didn't kill me.
It was my time.
It was supposed to be that way.
But it's so unfair.
It was your death that was unfair.
It was far too soon.
Celia, come now.
What?
Now?
You must find your way.
But I don't understand.
I'm here with you now.
Why can't we just stay like this?
You have no idea how I wish you could.
But you must earn it Celia.
How?
Celia, come now.
What's happening?
I can't say any more.
You have the answer inside.
You must stay in the sanctuary.
The door is there.
What door, what answer?
You can do it, Celia.
You belong here with me.
Remember that.
I'll be waiting for you.
No, Mom!
Wait!
Donovan!
Get inside.
He's gone.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.
Sorry's not going to cut it anymore, Celia.
I've about had it with you.
You know, there are others you know that that I can help.
Others that listen to me.
Pay attention to me.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
It's just that she was my mother that I've never met in my entire life.
How was I supposed to say no?
Because it's not real.
That place that you went is a lie.
Everything is a lie.
Are you trying to tell me that that those things ate my mother's soul and sent her to hell?
No.
No, not your mother.
She made it to heaven.
But it's the in betweens who get stuck.
That's bullshit.
My grandfather and Rachel, they were good people.
Both of them, and good people go to heaven.
Your grandfather wasted away after your mom died.
That's not true.
It is true.
He might as well have died along with her.
No.
He looked after me.
He took care of me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to yell at you.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to lose you to them, you know.
The fact is, Celia, your grandfather just went by the motions like most people these days after your mom died.
In the end he lived a mediocre life at best.'
So did I.
No.
Don't say that.
Sure you were timid and held back by guilt, but you had depth, and that counts.
Yeah.
A lot of good that did me.
I'm just sitting here waiting for these things to eat me.
Well, I told you about another option didn't I?
Not yet.
Agh, we have an half an hour, Celia.
A half an hour.
That's all you've got.
Don't look at me like that.
I just want to go home.
I know, sweetheart.
I wish you could too.
But it looks like you're just shit out of luck, so you're going to have to learn how to deal.
What was that?
I think there's something that I can do for you.
What are we doing here?
You'll see.
Watch.
What's wrong with this guy?
Besides being a rapist and a murderer?
Plenty.
I don't want to be here.
Wait.
Don't' let go yet.
You want to see this.
Don't stop.
Do it.
Be free.
Who's there?
That's good, Doug.
Good.
Donovan.
It's what he wants, Celia.
If he didn't I would not be able to do this.
Stop.
God dam nit.
You can't just kill him.
After what he did to you he deserves to die.
What about not playing God?
Celia, he wants to die.
I'm just helping him along.
See.
You're no better than he is.
You're a monster.
I don't need you.
Get away from me.
Okay, fine.
I wish you all the luck in the world on your own.
Oh, damnit.
What are you doing?
Stay back.
How did you get here?
Uh, I drove.
No.
No.
This -- you shouldn't be here.
What are you talking about?
This isn't your light.
This is still mine.
You son of a bitch.
You used my light.
My sanctuary saved you.
How is that fair?
You are seriously tweaked lady.
Whatever, I'm out.
Stop.
It's moving too fast.
You're fucking crazy.
This sanctuary won't last.
Sanctuary?
You're dead, Doug, you rapist.
You're dead, and that stuff you put in my drink it killed me.
And you're going to hell for it.
You're to of your mind.
Look!
Holy sh -- holy shit.
What the fuck is happening?
Oh shit.
Get back.
Shut the door.
What the hell was that thing?
It's a long story.
Do you have your car keys on you?
Where is it parked?
In the lot.
Well, we have to get to it.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
-What does your watch say?
-1:37
Alright, come on.
I'll explain on the way.
On the way to where?
To the hospital.
The light will be strong there.
There was an accident on the freeway today.
A lot of people were hurt.
What now?
We jump.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not jumping that far.
You're already dead.
Where, which way?
It's around the corner.
Where is it?
It's the black one.
Alright, let's go.
The car won't start.
What's going on?
This shouldn't be happening.
Let's go!
Cars don't work out here.
There's not enough power.
What are you talking about there's not enough power?
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh shit.
Celia it's me again.
Where are you?
I'm kind of freaked out here.
Corby's being a jackass.
Urprise.
But how can I ditching you.
Hold on.
God.
Hey there.
Hi.
Recognize me?
From the pictures.
You're my father.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.
You were sick.
This is my house.
Yeah.
I wanted you to feel more comfortable.
Want to sit down?
No.
I'd like to get to know you.
Well, t's too late.
Celia, come give your grandmother a hug.
How did you get here?
I came to see you.
I was so lonely here.
You must hurry, little one.
You must find the source.
Grandma?
Celia.
What'd she say to you?
What are you going to do to me?
What do you think?
Help.
Where am I?
Help!
Help!
Somebody Please help me!
Donovan.
What seems to be the problem.
I can't take this anymore.
I'll do whatever you want me to.
Just please, please, please make them stop.
It's for the best.
Go ahead.
Who are those people.
You promised you'd do what I say.
And you promised that things would get better.
It's better down there than being eaten by those creatures don't you think?
My guess is much better than eternal damnation.
I'm not going down there.
I'm not going to be one of them.
You have to trust me, Celia.
I know what I'm talking about.
No.
I trust me, and I'm not going down there.
Who did you see that I'm the one with the power here?
Get away from me.
No.
This is my house.
You will do what I say, and you will like it.
What do you want from me?
What would you get if I go down there?
Your soul.
You're one of them.
No.
I'm not one of them.
I'm something more.
Something different.
Their rules don't apply to me.
I have sophisticated tastes, Celia, refined you might say.
They're just sheep in my flock.
I'm watching them.
For who?
Looks like your sanctuary's almost gone, Celia.
Soon you won't be safe anywhere.
Stay away from me.
I would, but I think I'm going to hold onto you for myself.
Just a little secret between you, me and the big guy.
Watch your step.
Celia,
why do you run, Celia?
Celia, I'm going to find you.
Why don't you save us both some time here?
I miss you, Celia.
Find her now.
Make sure you have the pen and paper ready.
Oh my god, it's moving again.
Are you guys writing this down?
Don't miss any letters.
No way.
Are you feeling this?
Stop if, Go, I know it's you.
Honey, it ain't me.
What's it say?
Rear B A T H.
Celia.
This can all be over you know.
It won't be over.
I'll be stuck down there with those people.
Well, at least you won't be lonely.
Why didn't you just kill me?
Because, Celia, you weren't ready.
I consider the culinary experience an art form.
I nurture the souls until they're just the way I like them.
And those people in the cellar?
All carefully cultivated just like you.
You're disgusting.
Am I?
You know it's a shame that you died when you did.
I had so many places to guide you, so many things to acquire, true love, motherhood, pride, pride.
It's my favorite.
So you were just pretending so you could create a perfect meal.
But now I'll just have to work with what I've got.
How about we start with your laughter.
Not much to laugh about these days anyway.
So just tray.
How about your loyalty.
Loyalty is quite a delicacy, and what need do you have for it here?
I will give you nothing.
I'd be careful about what you say.
This can be painful or it can be easy.
That is your only choice now.
I will give you nothing.
Maybe I should be done with all of this, hand you to them, cut my losses.
What have you done?
Once your body leaves the sanctuary your soul goes with it.
Goodbye, Donovan.
We're losing her.
Get the defibrillator.
Interesting.
You must hurry, little one.
You must find the source.
You must stay in the sanctuary.
The door is there.
You were right here this whole time.
I'm so proud of you, but you must prove yourself.
I know you can do it.
You're supposed to be here with me.
Mom, what's happening?
I can barely understand you.
The link is weak.
You must hurry.
but you must first Grandpa.
I know you can do it.
Mom, wait.
Mom!
One more test.
One more test.
Shit.
Six minutes.
There's no one here.
There's no one left for me to save.
What do you want me to do?
One, two, three.
Grandpa, no.
You don't need to do this.
Grandpa, Papa, please.
Poor little soul.
Waning so badly to get into heaven.
Okay.
I'll give you what you want.
Really?
What's the catch?
No catch.
A deal.
Keep talking.
I'm listening.
I want you to free my grandfather.
Take a look, Celia.
Your grandfather's gone.
No .
No he isn't.
I can see him in there.
Stop lying to me.
Alright.
Suppose it is true.
Suppose I really can free him, what do I get in exchange?
Me.
All of me.
Aw, that's tempting, but it's unorthodox.
I'm not a man who makes deals.
Please, just this once for me.
You can take anything you want.
Anything?
Ooh, that is nice.
First free my grandfather.
Alright.
Stay there, gramps.
She's mine now.
Walk away.
Shall we begin?
Hey.
Stay away form her.
That's definitely a deal breaker, gramps.
Run, run.
Get in, trust me.
What about you?
No
You are my only father I ever have.
We have to go.
Celia.
Go, go, go!
This is my house, Celia.
Celia, come on.
Go grandpa.
Come on.
I'm your protector, Celia.
No you aren't, and you never have been.
Goodbye, Donovan.
Are you sure you want to do this?
I mean, you know, the last time we used this thing
Please.
Alright.
Yeah, you know, it probably lost its power or something.
Holy shit.
Shit.
Are you getting this?
Yes.
When you die, I will come for you.
Celia.
Hello.
Celia.
What's yours?
It's nice to meet you Donovan.
I can't.
I'm not allowed.
Hey, where'd you go?
Hey, where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
Where do you think you're going, little lady?
Huh?
Grandpa, I have to find him.
Find who?
The boy.
He's going to get away.
Come come say hi to mom and then you can go play.
Okay.
Come on, honey.
Okay.
Say hi to Mom.
Hi, Mommy.
Why don't you tell her all about your new tooth and how you're excited about starting volleyball practice next week.
Go on, sweetheart.
You can talk to her just like you talk to me.
I know she's listening.
Pay attention, Celia.
We're here to see your mommy.
Tell her about your week.
I don't want to.
What did you say?
I said I don't want to.
Why?
I just don't.
Honey, your mother loves you.
She loves you very much, baby.
I won't.
You can't make me.
Celia, honey!
Celia, no!
It's okay.
It's okay -- she's -- it's okay.
It's okay.
What are you doing?
Don't do that.
It's okay, Grandpa.
He protected me.
He's always going to protect me.
What if I would have lost you too, huh?
Don't do that, baby.
Please.
Celia?
Out here.
One for the road.
Are you ready, yet?
Hey, you can't rush perfection.
I have to find my keys.
What would I do without you?
Sure you want to do this?
Do what?
I know what this day means.
I know how you get.
So, we don't have to go if you don't want to.
Justine, it's my 21st.
I'd like to actually enjoy my birthday for once.
Are you sure?
'Cause I'm totally fine just staying at home.
Yes.
I could use a party.
Okay then.
Let's go.
Damn.
I'm glad you didn't get caught in that on the way up here, especially in that piece of crap car.
Yeah.
Stop it.
What?
Your birthday's not cursed.
Accidents like that happen everyday up here.
I know.
I -
- I -- we'll have fun tonight.
Yo, you hotties want to be in a movie?
You wish losers.
God, aren't you glad you came up here to share this culture experience?
Hey, I wanted to do something different.
This is different.
I do my best to deliver.
Just stay away from the freshies and you should be fine.
Alright.
Well just promise not to ditch me five minutes after we get in there for some idiot.
Scout's honor.
Oh, you know what?
You'll be too busy making out with Dougie Fresh, and I'll be left alone by the kegerator.
Okay.
There's not going to be any making it, at least not by me.
Uh-huh.
You came all the way up here for a little handholding and friendly conversation.
I came all the way up here so I could be with my best friend in the whole world.
And the hot guy she promised to hook you up with.
That's really the truth.
You gonna be okay?
If you ask me that one more time I'll kill you.
Come on.
Corby!
Justine!
Hey, you made it.
Hi.
Follow me.
This is Celia, my friend from San Diego.
Pleasure to meet you pretty lady.
Hi.
Can my boy Terry here offer you a cocktail?
You two should try the Famous Terry-bomb.
What?
One shot from each bottle.
What?
One shot from each bottle.
Oh, just beers please.
I want a Terry-bomb.
So, where's Doug?
I want him to meet Celia.
He's upstairs.
You're going to like him, really.
Let's see if he's in here.
Doug?
Alright, ladies?
Are you sure?
Cool.
Alright.
What's up, brother?
Hey, you seen Doug around?
No.
I haven't seen him since Jell-O shots.
Wow, you and your fine companions care to join us for a little other worldly excitement?
Yeah.
What are we in, third grade?
Hey now.
You dare mock the great Ouija?
Jesus, Gopher, put that thing away.
How you doin'?
Don't listen to him.
He's really just a D and D geek under that shaved chest.
True.
Oh my god.
Who's doing that?
It's not me.
I swear.
Well, quick, grab a pen and paper.
Go home, Celia.
It didn't say that.
Who the hell's Celia?
Um, she is.
Very funny.
I didn't.
Oh please.
You cannot punk me.
Whoa, whoa, ladies.
Let the man of the house lead.
Hey, move out.
You chicas wait in here.
I'll be right back.
It's kind of weird, huh?
Stop.
I swear it wasn't me.
Whatever.
Believe what you will.
Don't trust your number one girl.
So he's kind of cute, huh?
Who?
Corby?
Uh-huh.
I think I might hook up with him tonight.
Really?
What?
You don't approve?
I'm not here to judge.
It -- it's not for sure or anything.
I mean, there might be something better out there for me.
Well, you wouldn't want to miss out.
Look who I found.
Douglas, I've been looking all over for you.
This is my friend Celia.
It's her birthday.
Oh yeah?
Happy birthday.
Thanks.
Am I allowed to ask the number?
The big two one.
Nice.
Well, we'll have to make tonight special then.
Oh, thanks.
Hi.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why?
You just seemed a little --
I don't know -- distant back there.
No, I'm sorry.
Thanks for getting me this.
It's no place for a girl over there right now.
Naked keg stands.
No place for a guy either really.
So where's your girl?
She ditched me for a meathead.
Predictable.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
What was that?
What?
Nothing.
It was probably the music.
Come on.
You guys have a make out room?
Of course.
What kind of frat house would this be without one?
I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself there, buddy.
No.
Over here.
Come on.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
You'll see.
Come on.
What is this?
This was an old wine cellar back in the day, back before this was a fraternity.
It's probably like hundreds of years old.
Cool.
Yeah.
I like to come down here and think about like who came through that door, you know, what they talked about, what they drank.
I guess that makes me kind of a huge geek, huh?
No.
No.
I think it's really cute.
There it is.
What?
That look.
Why are you so sad?
It's your birthday.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I -
- I don't -- I didn't mean to.
It's okay.
You can tell me.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
It's not even a secret really.
Uh.
Uh, I really hoped that this wouldn't affect me this year.
But birthdays have never really been great for me.
Well, my mom died on my birthday.
She actually died giving birth to me.
So every year my birthday's kind of like a reminder that I killed her.
Shit, that -- that's rough.
Yeah.
And apparently my dad hit the bottle and disappeared so I was raised by my grandparents.
Which was great.
I mean, my grandpa was so amazing,
but he died last year, so.
I -
- I just really miss him.
No doubt, mm.
Every year I would spend my birthday with him, and he loved my mom so much.
But he would always remember to remind me that her death wasn't my fault.
That's -- that's some heavy shit.
And it was 21 years ago.
And I never even knew her.
Still it's hard to eat cake and ice cream you know.
Sure.
I'm sorry.
I'm just really sorry.
It's like baggage central.
Like I don't even know why I'm talking to you about this.
Let's not talk.
What's wrong?
I just heard it again.
What?
I feel really weird.
I need to get out of here.
I need to get some air.
Wait, don't go.
Seriously, I'm not feeling --
What did you do?
Come on, Celia.
Just relax.
Come on, man.
Hurry it up.
Hey, what -- hey, what the hell is wrong with her?
Dude, I think she's OD'ing.
Hello?
Please!
Help me!
This isn't real.
This isn't happening.
Somebody please get me out of here.
Somebody please.
Justine.
Justine.
Anybody.
Grandpa?
Hello?
Hello?
Holy shit.
Hello?
Hello, is anyone here?
You guys come on.
If this is a joke it's really not funny.
Justine?
Justine, are you here?
Hello?
Grandpa.
Hey, little lady.
Happy Birthday.
What's going on?
It's okay, Celia.
Everything's okay now.
No, no.
No.
This s a bad dream.
Don't be scared.
You died.
Yes.
Then how
You died too.
Those boys.
Those filthy boys, but they can't hurt you know.
You're safe now.
You're safe with me.
I'm dead?
Yes.
That stuff they put in my drink.
I wanna wake up now.
This is not dream Celia.
Yes, it is.
This is terrible dream.
I'm just passed out somewhere and I'm gonna wake up.
I know how you're feeling.
I'm not dead.
This is crazy.
I don't have time to explain it all.
You have to get out of this house.
Why?
Listen to me, Celia.
Do as I say and nothing bad will happen.
But, please, we've gotta go.
You cannot stay here.
Okay.
Quickly.
Where are we?
What is this place?
Stay with me and you'll find out.
Celia, you must go.
You must get out.
I will meet you out there.
Where are you going?
Don't leave me.
I promise you I will find you.
Go.
Whatever you do don't look back.
Run.
What the hell?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Grandpa?
No!
Go back to the house, Celia.
Who is that?
Go back to the house, Celia.
It's the only way.
Who's there?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Celia, sweetheart.
Come on, let's go.
Go away.
It's okay.
What is this?
Where am I?
It will all be over soon.
What do you mean?
Help.
Hello?
Is anybody here?
Hello, Celia.
Stay away from me.
It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay back.
Get away.
Celia.
Stop calling me that.
You don't know me.
I don't know what you guys put in my drink.
I'm not one those guys, and this isn't some bad trip.
I'm not dead.
Don't you tell me that I'm dead.
Look, I know you've had a tough night, you're upset.
So let's just calm down and talk about this, okay?
Calm down?
Just invite me in.
I'll explain everything to you.
Oh yeah, sure.
Come in so you can just kill me.
That's not why I'm here.
Now do you remember me?
Oh my god.
I'm your friend, Celia, and I always have been.
Hello.
Hello.
What's your name?
Celia.
What's yours?
They call me Donovan.
Nice to meet you Donovan.
Can you come and play Celia?
I can't.
I am not allowed.
Don't worry.
I am here to protect you.
I am always going to protect you Celia.
The cemetery.
You saved me from that car.
And countless other times I might add.
So what are you?
Like my guardian angel?
Not exactly.
I died too just like you.
I was only eight at the time so I understand how scared you must be.
This might be easier to explain if I wasn't out here freezing my ass off.
Well, if you think you're coming in here you're out of your mind.
Well we don't have a lot of time.
Two hours give or take.
Come two A.M. it's lights out.
And then I suppose I turn into a pumpkin.
No.
Then you become completely vulnerable to these nasty things out here.
So I'd can the sarcasm because I'm trying to help you.
I'm not letting you in here just so you can turn into one of those crazy psycho demon things like my grandfather just did.
You see, that wasn't your grandfather.
It was the soul eater that ate him, so now he can appear, act and sound like your grandfather.
This is crazy.
So you're telling me is that
I wasn't only raped and murdered tonight but but that my grandfather was eaten by one of those things?
I don't know what to believe.
Well, do you believe I am who I say I am?
Yes I do.
Well, that's enough for the time being.
Let me in.
It's not locked.
You actually have to invite me in.
You see, this white light around is called your sanctuary.
People can't come in your sanctuary unless you invite them.
And, once in, they can't touch you unless you touch tme first.
So, don't touch them.
That would be bad..
Okay.
Come in.
Come with me.
I have something to show you.
Shit.
Wait.
Hey.
Well, come on.
I'm not going out there.
I'm not really good with heights.
You're already dead.
Are you really afraid of falling?
Take a look.
We're the only ones here.
Exactly.
It's just you and me now.
That's why you gotta stick by me.
Wait, I just saw something.
Look, what is that?
That is a soul eater
What?
A soul eater is exactly as it sounds.
It needs to feed constantly or else it goes to hell.
They're all just waiting for the perfect moment when you step out into the light.
That's when it can attack.
You're my imaginary friend.
I must just be imagining you.
I'm as real as can be.
In fact, I'm a little offended that you stopped believing in me.
But you were the one that stopped coming around.
I haven't seen you since I was like eight.
Yeah, but I've been there the whole time.
When your grandfather, Joe, was in the hospital, or when you got drunk and crashed your grandpa's car into the dumpster.
I was there when you lost your virginity.
You were there for that?
I needed to make sure that you were paying attention.
You really never left?
Naw.
I wish I had known that.
Uh-oh.
What?
What is it?
Well, that flicker means that the light is dying.
We need to move to a place where the light is strong, fast..
Why?
What happens if it runs out?
You don't want to know.
Come on.
Let's do inside.
Celia, come on.
Hurry.
Celia.
Rachel.
Celia, help.
You've got to help me.
Oh my god.
Don't listen to her.
Something's after me.
It's trying to kill me.
She's not who she says she is, Celia.
Don't listen to him.
He can't be trusted.
He's not like you and me.
I'm your friend.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Celia, please.
You've got to help me.
I don't know .
Celia, look at me.
Do you remember?
Yes.
We came here the night I died.
It was different.
I always liked playing with you.
Yeah right.
I sucked.
You were always so much better than me.
Well, I was tougher than you.
Is that why you stuck up for me when everybody else made fun?
I knew it wasn't about you.
You were worried about someone else.
Do you remember the night my grandfather died?
That was a terrible night.
I never really thanked you.
I was all alone.
You barely knew me but you stayed with me all night.
I wouldn't have made it.
After that night we were connected weren't we?
Yeah.
I helped you then, Celia.
And now I need you to help me.
Please?
What the hell just happened to me?
Aw, gee, I don't know, genius.
Maybe it's the fact that you ignored everything I told you.
I was confused.
There's no time for confusion.
They will do whatever it takes to get into your head to get you out of the light.
You have to be smarter than them.
You have to think.
Okay.
But -- but if -- but if she if it was not Rachel then
how did it know all those personal things about me?
Because when it feeds it takes everything, memories, feelings, everything.
We have to get to the basement.
Hurry.
Now!
Try to stick by me from now on, alright?
No problem.
Hey
look.
Are you seeing this
I see everything.
It's a gift.
You'll find I have many gifts.
You can always see your old world through mirrors.
So this is what's happening right now at this exact moment?
They haven't found my body yet or else the party would be over.
Once your body leaves the sanctuary your soul goes with it.
Ten it's open season on your ass.
Come on now.
Don't start that.
I could never stand to see you cry.
I'm scared, Donovan.
It doesn't have to end this way.
I'm listening.
I'll show you.
But you're going to have to be brave, and I know that's not your strongest suite.
I guess you have been watching.
What are you doing?
This room leads to a place without soul eaters.
That's where this all started.
It's okay.
I can't.
Sure you can.
No, Donovan please, I have really bad feeling.
I've been through this a few times.
I think I might know what I'm talking about.
That place is evil.
I'm the guy who's protected you from evil your whole life.
I can't.
So you'd rather let them out there tear you to shreds?
That's what you'd rather have?
There's still more time.
Please just let me see if I can figure this thing out.
If we run out of time we can come back here.
Alright.
Thank you.
No matter what, don't look them in the eye.
She got me.
You need to cover that.
Hurry.
They're like sharks.
They smell blood, they know the source, they'll come.
Is that the right time?
Oh yeah.
We don't get much power here, but lights, clocks, that sort of thing.
It's 1:08.
If that's accurate your time is halfway gone.
What's he doing?
Isn't it obvious?
That ass hole.
Justine, no!
Now, keep your hand on the mirror.
As long as it's on the mirror you can hear everything they hear.
I cannot find her.
It's been hours.
You know what?
I think I saw her in the backyard.
Let's go.
You want to go dance or something?
I don't want to go dance.
I want to find my friend.
I don't want your beer.
I don't want your beer.
I want to find my friend.
Look I want
I don't want your beer.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Can't I just stay?
No.
It may appear that you're in this room, but it's not perspective.
It's not reality.
Stop!
They can't hear you, Celia.
I don't want beer.
I want to find Celia.
Why?
Why do you want to interrupt the magic?
She didn't just run off and get naked with Doug, okay.
She wouldn't do that.
Well, neither would you apparently.
Don't be a jerk, alright.
I just want to find Celia.
Would you stop freaking out.
She's a big girl.
I think she can take care of herself.
It's her birthday.
I don't want her to think I ditched her.
I can promise you she's not thinking about that.
Asshole.
She's off with my boy having a great time.
Auh.
No!
I tried to tell you.
I have to get back.
That's the stuff they put in my drink.
It'll kill her.
You can't affect living things anymore, Celia.
You need to understand that.
I have to help her.
It's out of your hands now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's think about this for just one second alright?
Your light is dying as we speak.
If she drinks that she creates a new sanctuary.
That gives you more light, and, plus, you two get to be together again.
I can't just let her die.
It's kind of the order of things.
Fuck you.
Hey, there's no need for the f-word.
Shh.
Seriously, baby.
Why don't we give them just like another half an hour.
I swear she's going to walk through the door with this huge smile on her face.
You clear have a lot of confidence with you friend.
My bros know how to get it done right.
Obviously.
Justine, walk away.
He's a dick.
Stop.
No.
No.
I'm going to need a lot more of this.
No!
Did you just see that?
Nice one.
Wha --
What?
We gotta go.
Hey, wait.
You lied to me.
I did not.
Yes you did.
You said I couldn't affect things.
You said there was nothing I could do.
Well, technically you can't affect living things, and that's true.
A cup of beer does not have a heartbeat.
Why would you want her to die?
Because I'm here to protect you, Celia.
We could have had her light.
We could have had her sanctuary.
Look.
I would never sacrifice my friend's life for my own.
Ever.
Well, it's that kind of thinking that's going to get you sent you know where.
Don't listen to him, Celia.
You're perfect just the way you are.
I'm very proud of you.
Don't do anything stupid here, Celia.
Shut up.
He's one of them.
Well, then how is he in my sanctuary?
He was in the living room.
He was in the light.
I was talking to him.
I don't know because you called him, let him in.
Fortunately for you he can't come back without another invitation.
Don't listen to him, Celia.
Listen to me.
He is not your grandfather.
I know that.
But there's a part of him that is still in there, isn't there?
I'm here, and you can be with me.
Listen to me, Celia.
I can take you to your mother.
I know she wants to meet you.
Yes.
Celia.
Just look at me, Celia.
Look at me.
It's okay.
You can go.
Mom?
I can't believe you're standing here.
I don't know where to start.
I know most of it anyway.
I've watched you your whole life.
You're so beautiful.
So are you.
More than any of the pictures.
I'm so sorry, Mom.
I'm so sorry.
You have to stop blaming yourself.
Please.
You didn't kill me.
It was my time.
It was supposed to be that way.
But it's so unfair.
It was your death that was unfair.
It was far too soon.
Celia, come now.
What?
Now?
You must find your way.
But I don't understand.
I'm here with you now.
Why can't we just stay like this?
You have no idea how I wish you could.
But you must earn it Celia.
How?
Celia, come now.
What's happening?
I can't say any more.
You have the answer inside.
You must stay in the sanctuary.
The door is there.
What door, what answer?
You can do it, Celia.
You belong here with me.
Remember that.
I'll be waiting for you.
No, Mom!
Wait!
Donovan!
Get inside.
He's gone.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.
Sorry's not going to cut it anymore, Celia.
I've about had it with you.
You know, there are others you know that that I can help.
Others that listen to me.
Pay attention to me.
Wait.
I'm sorry.
It's just that she was my mother that I've never met in my entire life.
How was I supposed to say no?
Because it's not real.
That place that you went is a lie.
Everything is a lie.
Are you trying to tell me that that those things ate my mother's soul and sent her to hell?
No.
No, not your mother.
She made it to heaven.
But it's the in betweens who get stuck.
That's bullshit.
My grandfather and Rachel, they were good people.
Both of them, and good people go to heaven.
Your grandfather wasted away after your mom died.
That's not true.
It is true.
He might as well have died along with her.
No.
He looked after me.
He took care of me.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to yell at you.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to lose you to them, you know.
The fact is, Celia, your grandfather just went by the motions like most people these days after your mom died.
In the end he lived a mediocre life at best.'
So did I.
No.
Don't say that.
Sure you were timid and held back by guilt, but you had depth, and that counts.
Yeah.
A lot of good that did me.
I'm just sitting here waiting for these things to eat me.
Well, I told you about another option didn't I?
Not yet.
Agh, we have an half an hour, Celia.
A half an hour.
That's all you've got.
Don't look at me like that.
I just want to go home.
I know, sweetheart.
I wish you could too.
But it looks like you're just shit out of luck, so you're going to have to learn how to deal.
What was that?
I think there's something that I can do for you.
What are we doing here?
You'll see.
Watch.
What's wrong with this guy?
Besides being a rapist and a murderer?
Plenty.
I don't want to be here.
Wait.
Don't' let go yet.
You want to see this.
Don't stop.
Do it.
Be free.
Who's there?
That's good, Doug.
Good.
Donovan.
It's what he wants, Celia.
If he didn't I would not be able to do this.
Stop.
God dam nit.
You can't just kill him.
After what he did to you he deserves to die.
What about not playing God?
Celia, he wants to die.
I'm just helping him along.
See.
You're no better than he is.
You're a monster.
I don't need you.
Get away from me.
Okay, fine.
I wish you all the luck in the world on your own.
Oh, damnit.
What are you doing?
Stay back.
How did you get here?
Uh, I drove.
No.
No.
This -- you shouldn't be here.
What are you talking about?
This isn't your light.
This is still mine.
You son of a bitch.
You used my light.
My sanctuary saved you.
How is that fair?
You are seriously tweaked lady.
Whatever, I'm out.
Stop.
It's moving too fast.
You're fucking crazy.
This sanctuary won't last.
Sanctuary?
You're dead, Doug, you rapist.
You're dead, and that stuff you put in my drink it killed me.
And you're going to hell for it.
You're to of your mind.
Look!
Holy sh -- holy shit.
What the fuck is happening?
Oh shit.
Get back.
Shut the door.
What the hell was that thing?
It's a long story.
Do you have your car keys on you?
Where is it parked?
In the lot.
Well, we have to get to it.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
#NOME?
#RIF!
Alright, come on.
I'll explain on the way.
On the way to where?
To the hospital.
The light will be strong there.
There was an accident on the freeway today.
A lot of people were hurt.
What now?
We jump.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not jumping that far.
You're already dead.
Where, which way?
It's around the corner.
Where is it?
It's the black one.
Alright, let's go.
The car won't start.
What's going on?
This shouldn't be happening.
Let's go!
Cars don't work out here.
There's not enough power.
What are you talking about there's not enough power?
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh shit.
Celia it's me again.
Where are you?
I'm kind of freaked out here.
Corby's being a jackass.
Urprise.
But how can I ditching you.
Hold on.
God.
Hey there.
Hi.
Recognize me?
From the pictures.
You're my father.
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.
You were sick.
This is my house.
Yeah.
I wanted you to feel more comfortable.
Want to sit down?
No.
I'd like to get to know you.
Well, t's too late.
Celia, come give your grandmother a hug.
How did you get here?
I came to see you.
I was so lonely here.
You must hurry, little one.
You must find the source.
Grandma?
Celia.
What'd she say to you?
What are you going to do to me?
What do you think?
Help.
Where am I?
Help!
Help!
Somebody Please help me!
Donovan.
What seems to be the problem.
I can't take this anymore.
I'll do whatever you want me to.
Just please, please, please make them stop.
It's for the best.
Go ahead.
Who are those people.
You promised you'd do what I say.
And you promised that things would get better.
It's better down there than being eaten by those creatures don't you think?
My guess is much better than eternal damnation.
I'm not going down there.
I'm not going to be one of them.
You have to trust me, Celia.
I know what I'm talking about.
No.
I trust me, and I'm not going down there.
Who did you see that I'm the one with the power here?
Get away from me.
No.
This is my house.
You will do what I say, and you will like it.
What do you want from me?
What would you get if I go down there?
Your soul.
You're one of them.
No.
I'm not one of them.
I'm something more.
Something different.
Their rules don't apply to me.
I have sophisticated tastes, Celia, refined you might say.
They're just sheep in my flock.
I'm watching them.
For who?
Looks like your sanctuary's almost gone, Celia.
Soon you won't be safe anywhere.
Stay away from me.
I would, but I think I'm going to hold onto you for myself.
Just a little secret between you, me and the big guy.
Watch your step.
Celia,
why do you run, Celia?
Celia, I'm going to find you.
Why don't you save us both some time here?
I miss you, Celia.
Find her now.
Make sure you have the pen and paper ready.
Oh my god, it's moving again.
Are you guys writing this down?
Don't miss any letters.
No way.
Are you feeling this?
Stop if, Go, I know it's you.
Honey, it ain't me.
What's it say?
Rear B A T H.
Celia.
This can all be over you know.
It won't be over.
I'll be stuck down there with those people.
Well, at least you won't be lonely.
Why didn't you just kill me?
Because, Celia, you weren't ready.
I consider the culinary experience an art form.
I nurture the souls until they're just the way I like them.
And those people in the cellar?
All carefully cultivated just like you.
You're disgusting.
Am I?
You know it's a shame that you died when you did.
I had so many places to guide you, so many things to acquire, true love, motherhood, pride, pride.
It's my favorite.
So you were just pretending so you could create a perfect meal.
But now I'll just have to work with what I've got.
How about we start with your laughter.
Not much to laugh about these days anyway.
So just tray.
How about your loyalty.
Loyalty is quite a delicacy, and what need do you have for it here?
I will give you nothing.
I'd be careful about what you say.
This can be painful or it can be easy.
That is your only choice now.
I will give you nothing.
Maybe I should be done with all of this, hand you to them, cut my losses.
What have you done?
Once your body leaves the sanctuary your soul goes with it.
Goodbye, Donovan.
We're losing her.
Get the defibrillator.
Interesting.
You must hurry, little one.
You must find the source.
You must stay in the sanctuary.
The door is there.
You were right here this whole time.
I'm so proud of you, but you must prove yourself.
I know you can do it.
You're supposed to be here with me.
Mom, what's happening?
I can barely understand you.
The link is weak.
You must hurry.
but you must first Grandpa.
I know you can do it.
Mom, wait.
Mom!
One more test.
One more test.
Shit.
Six minutes.
There's no one here.
There's no one left for me to save.
What do you want me to do?
One, two, three.
Grandpa, no.
You don't need to do this.
Grandpa, Papa, please.
Poor little soul.
Waning so badly to get into heaven.
Okay.
I'll give you what you want.
Really?
What's the catch?
No catch.
A deal.
Keep talking.
I'm listening.
I want you to free my grandfather.
Take a look, Celia.
Your grandfather's gone.
No .
No he isn't.
I can see him in there.
Stop lying to me.
Alright.
Suppose it is true.
Suppose I really can free him, what do I get in exchange?
Me.
All of me.
Aw, that's tempting, but it's unorthodox.
I'm not a man who makes deals.
Please, just this once for me.
You can take anything you want.
Anything?
Ooh, that is nice.
First free my grandfather.
Alright.
Stay there, gramps.
She's mine now.
Walk away.
Shall we begin?
Hey.
Stay away form her.
That's definitely a deal breaker, gramps.
Run, run.
Get in, trust me.
What about you?
No
You are my only father I ever have.
We have to go.
Celia.
Go, go, go!
This is my house, Celia.
Celia, come on.
Go grandpa.
Come on.
I'm your protector, Celia.
No you aren't, and you never have been.
Goodbye, Donovan.
Are you sure you want to do this?
I mean, you know, the last time we used this thing
Please.
Alright.
Yeah, you know, it probably lost its power or something.
Holy shit.
Shit.
Are you getting this?
Yes.
When you die, I will come for you.
Celia.
In New York City's war on crime, the worst criminal offenders are pursued by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.
These are their stories.
One little African kid die in every 3 seconds because they ain't got enough food.
Man, that ain't right.
I mean, we tank and rip off what falls out of my mother-in-law's mouth.
Excuse me.
I'm locked out.
I went out the wrong door.
Could you let me back in?
Sure.
Thanks.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
Excuse me.
Is this the way to Human resources?
Down the hall, turn right.
Thanks.
- Here, let me give you a hand.
- Ah, thanks.
You can just dump that anywhere.
That's okay.
I'm on my break.
You're supposed to wear that badge where people can see it.
I forgot.
Better go get my badge before I get in trouble.
Good idea.
Thanks.
The duct's unsupported.
It won't hold your weight.
I can do it.
You'll stand lookout in the stairwell.
We'll have to move quick, so it's only gonna be the three of us.
Sorry, Drew.
We okay?
Sure.
Don't confuse me with someone who cares, because I don't.
I know what this is worth to you.
You come up with the number, then we'll talk.
If I'm not back in ten, just get out.
What the hell are you doing up here?

Law Order CI 5x15 Wrongful Life
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2006/03/26
Start with complaint about a bad smell from the tap water.
Looks like he's been in there three or four days.
Any idea how he got up here?
No.
Doors are locked and alarmed.
Roof's been secure since 9/11 on account of it has sight lines on four federal buildings.
All right.
Well, it could be an accident.
Nylon rope and climbing shoes.
This guy wasn't out for a stroll.
Wait a second.
Hey, let's see if we can something off this memory card. / Okay.
Hey, let's get these shoes.
Right there.
Flashlight, utility knife, and... magnets?
Magnets?
Magnets?
Why is this fan off?
It should be turning.
Can we, uh, get this off?
Looks like somebody put this here to stop the fan from going around.
Where does this duct go to?
- It's just coolant.
- Yeah.
A lot of dust in here.
Looks like I got two sets of footprints.
Some going in, some going out.
Looks like the one going in matches the treads on the shoes of the victim.
The set coming out must have found another way up to the roof.
Where's the nearest access to this duct?
It's through here.
Oh, wait.
It's another magnet.
Marks from a shoe.
Number two climbed up through here.
Ah, uninvited guest.
I'm sorry it happened, okay?
But I can't have this following me for the rest of my life.
Can I count on you or not?
She'll say she was with me.
Okay?
These from the victim's camera?
Yeah.
That's the last two he took, right there.
- Isn't that the top of the courthouse?
- Yeah.
The roof where we found the body offers the only clear view of that statue.
Courthouse makes a nice terrorist target.
Yeah, well, I'm not sure that's what we're dealing with.
Look, these narrow passageways.
Slime-covered walls.
Tile work in abandoned subway stations.
Look, these... they might be trophies.
Thank you.
You know, the record of an urban explorer.
Maybe he saw something on that roof he wasn't supposed to.
Johnny Magneto's real name is Eric Newsome.
Engineering student.
His parents reported him missing Sunday.
Home of Ron Christine Newsome East Meadow, New York Tuesday, March 14
A water tower.
That just doesn't make sense.
He wouldn't be where he had no business.
You know his friends?
Maybe other engineering students?
We don't know them.
Eric moved out three years ago.
Nikki, our daughter, might.
She studies architecture at the same college as Eric.
We told her you were coming.
We're very sorry about Eric.
When's the last time you talked to him?
Friday.
He was supposed to come to dinner Saturday.
This is Nikki and her friend Drew.
The police asked about Eric's friends.
He, he didn't really have a lot.
He was...
kind of a grind.
Eric had to work part-time.
Unlike some people, he wasn't handed everything.
Did you talk to your brother on Friday night?
No.
I was busy.
We went out to dinner.
I'll need to see Eric's apartment.
Maybe you could show us around.
If you want to bring Drew, that's fine with us.
Eric's papers are over here.
That shot from her father.
You get that a lot?
He thinks my family's rich.
Maybe it has something to do with where you take his daughter to dinner.
Where'd you go Friday night?
It was an Indian restaurant.
What'd you have?
Just be careful what you say.
Because my partner is asking Drew the same question.
Green stain on your necklace.
Did you get that in the utility room Friday night?
It's coolant, right?
Did you break into that building?
With Eric?
Was Drew with you?
Just Rafe.
He's a student with Eric.
You wanna tell us what happened on the roof?
I don't know.
Uh, Eric went up... he went up by himself.
And Rafe was keeping lookout.
And when Eric didn't come back, we thought maybe he was caught.
So... we took off.
Was Eric in trouble with anybody?
No.
We don't hurt anybody.
It's, it's a game.
We like to break into places and just look around.
I got a problem.
Come over here.
Come here.
Okay.
These are all the places where you've been. / Yes.
- Tell me about them.
- Well...
That is a drainpipe under the Cypress hill cemetery.
That is inside the roof of the Crown building.
Nobody's ever taken a picture of the aperture before.
My, my brother showed me places I've never seen.
There's a photo missing.
No, that's, that's all the places we've been.
This photo was on Eric's camera, and it's not on the board.
I've never seen this before.
All right, Nikki, you can go back over with Drew.
I guess it's a place that Eric went without the others.
Whatever secret he was keeping from his friends... looks like it came back and bit him.
Is your brother buying a motorcycle?
He couldn't afford it.
Priced a couple of models.
Got loan rates.
Secret missions, big ticket purchases.
He was making his urban spelunking pay off.
Oxygen.
These pipes in the chase, they carry oxygen.
Some kind of scientific facility?
A lab or a hospital?
Not too many of those in the five boroughs.
There was a photo that was taken five days before this one.
He's on a roof.
Here.
Look.
Building to the right.
That's Murray hill hospital.
He scouted it.
That's an access to that utility chase.
This is the only storage room that has one.
From one haystack to another.
- What's in these boxes?
- Just old patient files.
When's the last time someone was in here?
- May of last year.
- Yeah?
Look at this.
The back left-hand corner has been crushed.
And these boxes here have been moved over.
Well, someone's made a mess of this.
Maybe to keep these boxes from leaning into this one?
Maybe Eric wanted something in here.
This tape is new, it's not brittle like the others.
Box 4728-A.
Dr. Everett Janns' patient files.
He died a few years ago.
We keep his files for statistical studies.
Maybe we start by checking all the files are there?
You mind?
Thanks.
- Cadila, Anne.
- Okay.
- Cagney, Carla.
- Right.
Calos, Amy.
All the patients are women.
Dr. Janns was an OB/GYN?
Yes.
He was with the hospital almost 30 years.
Cantola, Marcie.
Carson, Victoria.
Cohen, Shelly.
Hang on.
Wait.
Victoria Carson's file is gone.
We find Victoria Carson, maybe she tells us why Eric wanted her file.
Any way of finding her address?
Home of Olivia Graham 221 East 81st Street Thursday, March 16
Victoria Carson?
We bought the house three years ago, and we still get mail for her.
I forward it.
Let me see if I can find her address for you.
I'll just be a minute.
Elevator?
It's bigger than the one in my building.
Smells better too.
- It's built 15 years ago.
- Oh, I hate that thing.
It makes us so lazy.
Oh, Ms. Carson's address.
Uh, I called her on the phone once.
She was very nice.
Asked how the garden was doing.
I could tell she missed having a garden where she is now.
Oh, here it is.
Um... 795 Francis Lewis boulevard.
Apartment 410.
That's over the bridge somewhere, isn't it?
Queens village.
That's a lot more than a bridge away from here.
Mom should be back soon.
What do you want to talk to her about?
It's your mom's business, Lisa.
It's better you ask her.
Like she ever tells me anything.
We were at your old apartment in the city.
We like the elevator.
My parents put it in for me.
This place sucks, but at least it's all on one floor.
So Lisa, why are you in a wheelchair?
Spina bifida.
Everyone's always afraid to ask.
You moved to Queens.
Is that to be closer to your school or doctor?
No.
We had to after dad died.
What were you doing at our old place?
We really can't talk about that with you.
Thanks.
You guys would get along great with my mom's lawyer.
Lisa?
Lisa!
Would you come help me with this...
Victoria Carson?
I'm detective Eames.
This is detective Goren.
Your name came up during an investigation.
Uh, we need to ask you a few questions in private.
Oh, uh...
Lisa, put this in the kitchen.
How did my name come up?
In connection with a Dr. Everett Janns at Murray hill hospital.
Murray hill hospital?
That was so long ago.
22 years, according to their accounting department.
Dr. Janns was your obstetrician when you were pregnant with Lisa?
Uh, no, no.
I went into the, uh... excuse me.
went into the ER with bad cramps one night.
Dr. Janns was on duty.
Uh, that's when I found out I was pregnant.
Um, I got my own obstetrician after that.
Is there any reason anybody'd want to steal Dr. Janns' file on you?
I'm surprised there's even a file.
I only saw him that one time.
Your daughter mentioned, um, a lawyer.
You involved in a lawsuit?
As a matter of fact, um...
I'm suing the obstetrician I ended up with, Dr. McKenna.
He never did the test that would have shown that Lisa had spina bifida.
If you had known, would you have had an abortion?
At least I would have been able to make an informed decision.
Lisa has had a terrible, painful life.
The lawsuit must have been hard on her.
She knows it's about providing for her future.
You sure there's nothing in Dr. Janns' file that's relevant to the lawsuit?
No.
All he said was, uh... that I had cramps because I was pregnant.
Do you know an Eric Newsome?
He's an engineering student.
Newsome?
My son has a girlfriend with that last name.
Your son?
His name's Drew?
Yes, Drew Ramsey.
Both he and Lisa have my late husband's name.
Why?
Do you know my son?
I didn't tell him about the lawsuit.
I didn't even really like the guy.
Like him or not, you needed him to get the file.
I didn't even know that my mother saw that doctor.
You and Nikki, how long were you seeing each other?
Three months.
She wouldn't tell Eric.
About the lawsuit.
She knew.
She's helping me research it.
This lawyer my mom hired thinks we can get $20 million.
But we have to do a lot of the stuff ourselves.
What kind of research is Nikki doing?
She's going over old checkbooks and bills that my mother got from the obstetrician.
She works summers as a bookkeeper, so she knows what she's doing.
Uh, can you give us a minute?
So Nikki might have come across an old bill at Murray hill hospital.
Figured out that Drew's mother saw another doctor.
That would make a big difference to the doctor being sued.
$20 million lawsuit.
Maybe Nikki and her brother Eric... figured that they could sell that file to the highest bidder.
And one of the bidders decided murder was more cost efficient.
Drew made me promise not to tell anybody about the lawsuit.
Your brother Eric found out from somebody, Nikki.
You're the obvious choice.
Your parents work hard.
Maybe you and Eric thought you could get money for that file, money for your parents.
That wouldn't be wrong, would it?
Yes, it would.
I'd be stealing from Drew.
That matters to you?
Yeah?
You've only known him for a few months.
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt him.
And your research for Drew?
Is that on that computer?
Could we see?
What's that?
Did you type in an old password by habit?
Did you change your password?
Is that because somebody hacked into your computer?
- Was that Eric?
- Don't, please.
He was my brother.
When was he on your computer?
The Tuesday before he died, he said he was checking his e-mail.
You keep information about Dr. Janns in here?
All I have is a spreadsheet of the bills
Drew's mom paid to her obstetrician Dr. McKenna, see?
McKenna's phone numbers and address.
Maybe this is how Eric found out who Drew's mother was suing.
Eric wouldn't take money that wasn't his.
Well, there's one person who'd know for sure.
Office of Dr. Dominic McKenna Brooklyn, New York Monday, March 20
My lawyer advised me not to talk to anyone about the lawsuit.
You didn't answer the question, Dr. McKenna.
Did you get a call from a young man offering to sell you a document?
My father doesn't need to buy documents.
- This lawsuit is a joke.
- We met Lisa Ramsey.
It doesn't seem very funny to us.
You're being sued for, um... err, uh, wrongful life.
There's no such thing.
All life is sacred.
- Dad.
- Job was born 20 years ago.
Isn't there a statute of limitations for that kind of thing?
Victoria Carson claims she only just became aware of facts...
Dad, dad... / that she said influenced my treatment of her.
- The woman is lying.
- What facts?
You can talk about it with the lawyer.
"In god's hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind."
Job.
Those facts, they're your religious beliefs.
If a test showed that Victoria Carson's baby had spina bifida, she might have had an abortion, which you oppose.
You probably didn't even tell her there was a test available.
I'm not some sunshine Christian.
I practice what I believe.
And her condition didn't warrant...
She told us she never got the chance to make an informed decision.
That's not true.
You were the first doctor she saw.
She was scared, and you have such a terrific bedside manner, everything you told her she bought hook, line, and sinker.
No!
She didn't pick the first doctor in the phone book.
She made an informed choice.
Oh, she went looking for another doctor.
I, I didn't mean that.
Oh, so then you have something here, like a patient's file.
We don't have any such thing.
And we have nothing more to say.
Now, please... leave.
Whatever they got from Eric, maybe he kept a copy.
No file here.
I'm running out of hiding places.
You?
More magnets.
I got books on magnets and engineering.
A false door?
It's hollow here.
Electromagnetism?
A magnetic lock.
Oh, brother.
We got rainy day money.
Old gold coins.
I got a letter here from Dr. Janns to Dr. McKenna... dated 22 years ago.
Dr. Janns is concerned with Victoria Carson's cramps.
"Naturally, the tests we ran were not exhaustive."
"To be on the safe side, I recommend you have all appropriate tests done"
"to determine the health of the fetus."
Janns warned McKenna something might be wrong, and McKenna did nothing.
This is the smoking gun.
But the rest of Victoria Carson's file is not in here.
Eric wouldn't give McKenna the whole package without getting paid.
Unless Victoria Carson remembers seeing Janns.
But is not sure what's in the file.
I mean, it was 22 years ago.
Look, if she made a formal request for that file,
Dr. McKenna's lawyer would find out.
So maybe Drew came up with the idea of Eric stealing the file.
And Eric, before he turned it over to Drew... he read it.
Realized its value.
He kept it.
If Drew found out Eric was trying to sell it to McKenna, that puts Drew at the head of the class to kill Eric.
Why are you looking at his shoes?
We want to see if the treads match the ones at the crime scene.
Crime scene?
You mean Eric, right?
I know what happened to Eric.
He fell.
He didn't have good balance.
He was misaligned.
How do you mean?
He had scoliosis.
You've met him.
No, I...
I saw him on a video of the birthday party my brother had for his girlfriend.
And you noticed that he had curvature of the spine?
Eric had one shoulder higher than the other.
I'm very sensitive to these things.
Lisa.
Do you know that 20% of healthy people are born with some mild form of spina bifida?
They go through their whole life and never find out.
What are you doing in my room?
We've got a warrant to search it.
I watched them, Drew.
They didn't take anything.
Look what I found.
"Love and rockets".
Number 48.
Ah, cool.
Come on, I'll get you something to eat.
Are you okay?
They didn't bother you, did they?
No.
So, Eric's right shoe, there's wear on the inner sole.
He averted his right foot.
The leg was shorter than the left.
It would have thrown his spine out of alignment.
So she was right about him.
Yeah, but his scoliosis is so mild, she would have never picked that up on a video.
She would have had to meet him in person.
And she doesn't want anybody to know about it, not even Drew.
You saw how she changed the subject when he came in.
Maybe Eric came to see her about the letter before he went to McKenna.
Yes, and maybe selling the letter to McKenna was her idea.
To what, sabotage her own lawsuit?
Her mother's lawsuit.
A wrongful life lawsuit.
Maybe Lisa didn't think there was anything wrong with her life.
Maybe she didn't want to give the jury a chance to say that her mother should have aborted her.
They didn't find anything, mom.
You have got to be more careful, Drew!
Just don't... forget why we're doing this.
For Lisa, I know.
For her well-being.
We are not going to live in this dump forever.
Now go.
Get your sister ready for bed.
She's angry.
It's not about you, huh?
She loves you.
Okay?
Okay?
After you.
Why are you here?
Everybody knows me.
We know, you're here four times a week.
We could go next door to the diner, if you want.
Where you and Eric went.
The receptionist recognized Eric from the picture.
He met you here.
So, what'd you talk about?
The lawsuit?
Let's talk about the lawsuit.
Did you ever think that if your mother was tested when she was pregnant, that you wouldn't be here?
I had to be here.
Uh, I'm the one who brought mom and dad together.
Your mom tell you that?
Dad did.
She takes good care of you, your mom, right?
Well, she's organized your little saddlebag there.
You got books and snacks.
No.
Drew does that.
He helped me with tagging my chair too.
It's my design.
I'm going into graphic arts next year.
So what is it that your mother does for you?
Does she help with your medical care?
Your hygiene?
She helps you dress?
Drew helps me.
Since dad died.
So maybe for your mother, the lawsuit was not just about getting money for your care.
No.
It's just the money.
Well, maybe she thinks that she should have had the chance to stop you from being born.
That... she wants a court to say that... yours is a wrongful life.
No!
My mother loves me.
She would have had me no matter what.
Why'd you meet with Eric?
'Cause you wanted to stop the lawsuit?
No.
The lawsuit is about my life, and nobody tells me anything, not even Drew.
I heard him telling mom about something he and Eric did.
What, exactly?
Drew wouldn't tell me.
So I called Eric.
He said Drew asked him to break into someplace and steal a file.
It was just a big game to him.
I told him the lawsuit wasn't a game.
He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about.
I don't, um... the lawsuit, Eric, he didn't know?
That's what he said.
Did he tell you what was in the file he stole?
He said he didn't look.
He just kept asking about the lawsuit, and how much it was for.
I just wanted information.
Sometimes people act like I don't exist.
Eric didn't know about the lawsuit until he spoke to Lisa.
He had no reason to steal the letter before handing the file over to Drew.
Meaning he had nothing to sell Dr. McKenna.
Then I must be losing my mind.
Didn't you find the letter in Eric's apartment?
A copy of which we now believe is in Dr. McKenna's possession?
Well, this letter might not be what we think it is.
Look, these are letters that Dr. Janns wrote to doctors.
They're terse.
They're clinical.
These other letters...
he wrote to patients.
They're more conversational.
Like the letter in Eric's apartment.
Here.
"To be on the safe side,"
"I recommend you have all the appropriate tests done"
"to determine the health of the fetus."
Like night and day.
Could the letter have originally been addressed to a patient?
Well... yeah.
I mean, they, they, someone might have changed them.
Readdressed it to McKenna.
And how did it get in Dr. McKenna's hands?
Probably the same way it got into Eric's apartment.
I've never seen this.
I told you, I didn't know anything about Eric breaking into a hospital.
Eric told somebody he broke in because you asked him to.
You were even overheard talking about it.
That's a lie.
Drew, let me do the talking.
Eric told Lisa what he did.
You know how hungry Lisa is for information about things that affect her life?
She heard you talking to your mother about Eric.
She called him.
He told her what he did for you.
That's when Eric learned about the lawsuit.
How much money your family stood to make.
He called you, you and your mother, to shake you down.
The people you should be talking to are Dr. McKenna and his son.
They had the most to fear from this letter. / This letter?
Your client fabricated this to throw suspicion on the McKennas.
Dr. McKenna's nurse remembers coming into work two days after Eric was killed and finding a letter in an envelope under the door.
Your client planted another copy in Eric's apartment.
You can hang a murder case on a nurse's memory?
Eric never had a letter.
Instead, he threatened to tell McKenna that your mother saw Dr. Janns.
Isn't that right?
Eric was a menace to the lawsuit.
You wanted money that belonged to your sister...
- Okay, this conversation's over!
- That she needed for her care!
You couldn't let him hurt Lisa.
You and your mother had to stop him.
Okay!
Yes.
I did it.
- I killed him.
- Drew, stop right there.
It was my idea.
Nobody knew.
I went up to the roof through another vent.
- This is all off the record.
- I was there waiting for him, and then... yes, I did what you said.
I sent this letter to Dr. McKenna's office.
But it's not a fake.
It's real.
I found it in Dr. Janns' files.
It's real.
Drew!
That's enough.
I want to speak to my client in private right now.
Let's go.
If they were all that easy...
I'm starting to think you're overpaid.
He's lying about the letter.
You know, this murder confession is practically an afterthought.
His affect is one of convincing us that the letter is real.
The letter is not real.
Dr. Janns did not write McKenna.
This is a sidebar, detective.
We have our murderer.
Drew could be lying to protect his mother.
Lisa overheard Drew talking to her about Eric.
Whatever you do, do not endanger this confession.
Drew rewrote a letter from Dr. Janns to a patient.
Saying "the health of the fetus".
What if originally it said "the health of "your" fetus"?
The letter was to Drew's mother?
If Dr. Janns told her to get tested, why didn't she?
What did Lisa's father tell her?
That she's the one that brought her parents together.
Brought Victoria together with a rich husband.
I wonder what Victoria's in-laws have to say about that?
I didn't say anything to the police about Drew.
Why, did he say I got him into trouble?
You know your brother better than that.
But you don't fool me.
How could you, after everything we've done?
Done for me?
I didn't ask to be here!
Oh, that's good.
You remember to say that when you testify in the lawsuit.
Mom?
I'll be in in a while!
Apartment of Janice Ramsey 124 West 82nd Street Thursday, March 23
Victoria was seven months pregnant when she married your son.
These things happen.
Is that why they got married, because she was pregnant?
They were engaged for two years.
David was ready to move on, and then... well, he didn't have the heart to talk Victoria out of having the baby.
It would have been easier if we knew then what we know now.
You mean about Lisa.
Your family's wealthy.
I mean, that's correct?
Well, we were.
I guess your son would have been seen as a good catch.
Especially by Victoria.
She doesn't seem to have any money now.
Did it all go for Lisa's care?
Oh, hardly.
My husband put everything, including David's inheritance, into high tech.
Boom to bust in 20 years.
I feel a little sorry for Victoria.
All that effort to snap up David and getting burdened with Lisa.
She doesn't have much to show for it now.
You'll be happy to know Victoria's making her own opportunities.
She's suing her obstetrician for not testing for spina bifida.
- The one in Brooklyn?
- You know him?
No.
I gave her the name of three doctors right in her neighborhood.
But she felt that this Brooklyn doctor cared as much about her baby as she did.
Oh, excuse me.
A shotgun wedding.
Victoria might have been worried she'd never get to the altar if her groom found out their unborn child had a birth defect.
Yeah, Dr. Janns suspected there was something wrong.
So he advised her that she should get tested.
So she looked for someone that wouldn't test her.
When Drew found Dr. Janns' letter, he figured out what his mother did.
That's why he's lying about the letter, why he won't incriminate her.
He doesn't want Lisa to know she was just bait in a trap.
We're gonna have to give him a way out.
They're throwing you a lifesaver, Drew.
If you have anything to tell them about your mother, this is the time.
But she didn't do anything.
I don't wanna talk about my mother.
Send her in, please.
This shouldn't take long.
Drew?
Have a seat, Ms. Carson.
I wasn't told my son would be here.
And you dragged my daughter down here?
We may have to speak to her later.
Drew, are you all right?
Everything's okay, mom.
Don't worry.
He hasn't implicated you.
Well, why would he?
I didn't have anything to do with this boy Eric.
And I'm sure what happened was an accident.
The only reason why he didn't implicate you is because... if Drew goes to prison, well... there's not gonna be anybody left to take care of Lisa.
He's got this idea you're gonna take care of Lisa.
Instead of dumping her at the first cut-rate group home on your way to the local wine bar.
I will absolutely take care of her.
Who takes care of her now?
Drew.
And before him, your husband.
Lisa told us that.
Before I had to work for a living, I used to take care of her.
Lisa just doesn't remember.
Or chooses not to.
So she's ungrateful?
That's what you're saying?
She's moody.
Who wouldn't be in her condition?
I think she can get past that.
It's the lies.
Children know when you're lying to them.
I never lie to her.
You lied when you conceived her.
I mean, it wasn't through an expression of love or even lust.
Cold calculation.
That is a lie!
Your pregnancy was your ticket to... you know, the good life.
Even Dr. Janns' warning didn't dissuade you.
Instead, you found a doctor whose beliefs stopped him from interfering with your plan.
If Lisa had to be born paralyzed, or broken, well, then, that's the price she'd have to pay for your happiness.
You shut up.
I will not have you spewing this bile in front of my son!
He already knows.
Drew?
Don't you?
I mean, you found the letter, right?
Letter that Janns wrote to your mother.
And you used that to... fake the letter that you planted in Eric's apartment?
Isn't that true?
The two of you panicked, when, you know, Eric was threatening to tell
Dr. McKenna about his midnight excursion to Murray hill hospital.
I mean, you panicked because that would have torpedoed your lawsuit.
And you... 'cause you didn't want Lisa to know why she was brought into this world.
'Cause it wasn't because she was the love child that brought her... you know, her parents together.
No, she was just a spoke in this web that your mother wove.
So what are you gonna do?
You gonna leave Lisa with this, um, woman?
Take care of Lisa?
How would that work?
What, would that be out of the goodness of your heart?
Do you think you would trust this woman's maternal instincts?
Come on.
Huh, Drew?
Drew, I promise you, I promise you, I will take care of her.
We can offer better than a promise, Mr. Ramsey.
We can make her take care of your sister.
For as long as necessary as a condition of her probation.
If you testify to her role in Eric Newsome's death,
I'll recommend she get probation on the condition she provide court-supervised care for Lisa.
Any sign of neglect, and your mother will serve the rest of her sentence in prison.
All Lisa has to do is pick up the phone and call Mr. Carver's office.
Drew, it's win-win here.
Drew...
Drew!
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare lie to them.
You know that I didn't do anything!
You gotta speak up now.
Because soon... she's gonna be beyond your protection.
You gotta do this for her.
Drew...
But then she's gonna find out what my mother did to her. / Yeah.
Why she was born.
She really believes what my father told her.
She's not a child, man.
She's a young woman.
She needs to know the truth.
You're the only one that's gonna tell her.
Drew!
It would destroy her!
You know that.
Just please...
keep your mouth shut, okay?
I told my mother what Eric wanted...
That he wanted money.
Or he'd tell McKenna...
about Dr. Janns.
She, um, she told me to get rid of him.
She said that people like Eric... would get a taste of money and keep on coming back.
Well, she would know.
Victoria Carson, you're under arrest for murder.
You little bastard.
You ungrateful little...
All of your life, you have been nothing but a burden!
You and your sister!
Nothing but stones around my neck!
Stones around my neck!
Let go of me!
Let go of me!
Can I speak to my sister, please?
Yes.
It's a heavy responsibility telling her the truth.
She can take it.
But him?
He might have a hard time admitting his family's just a get-rich-quick scheme.
It's already something more than that.

We need to spend some time together.

What,s the point in love?
Can,t take it With you.
(Car horn blares )
- See you Later.
- Yeah.
- Jase!
- There,s more Where that Came from.
(She giggles )
I,LL give you a call.
Jesus gave up his Life for his fellow man.
But We dOn,t just mourn his Passing.
We celebrate his sacrifice.
And it is this that helps us deal With the loss Of someone We love.
Oh, my GOd.
Oh, my GOd!

36 hours?
(Fi) you all right, honey?
Oh, my GOd.
Oh, my GOd.

HOW dare you use Viagra behind my back?
- It isn,t Viagra.

See you in a bit.
De tal palo, tai astiLLa.

Are you mad?
She has a right to know.

My mum,s a big tom Cruise fan.
She WOuLdn,t appreciate the joke.

- HOW long have We been friends?
- And We still dOn,t know each Other.
YOu,ve got such a rude arse.

I Can think Of a few things.

Ladies, I have tO gO.
I,LL see you Later, yeah?
Why the hell did I Listen to you?
- I Can,t see What I,ve done.
- I look Like a bloody DaLek.
I looked down at the sheets and thought someone had pitched a tent.
YOu said you Were having problems.
And because Of your dumb-ass suggestions, things are a hell Of a lot worse.
She says she Wants to pack it in, end the relationship.
- That,s What she said?
- She Went mad.
- ALL kinds Of things started coming Out.
- What do you mean?
This is the nightmare Of all nightmares.
But you Were trying to show her you loved her.
She dOesn,t understand that.
She WOn,t believe anything I say.
This is all your fault.
I tried to tell her that.
YOu told Fi it Was my fault?
well, you gave me these sOdding things.
- Oh, thanks.
Mate.
- It Wasn,t my idea, Was it?
It Was you who screwed up your relationship.
I just tried to help.

I Was trying to sort things Out.

The thing about the little things is you tend to forget them When faced With the big things.
Aagh!
Tit!
(Buzzer)
# When desolation comes to call on you
# And decides to stay a while
# And desperation seems to cloud the view
# When those tears are in your eyes
# As trouble towers Like a mountain

# Don,t surrender... #
I feel I should be upset.
Were you very close?
But he,s still my dad.

But it,s just everything.
It,s the fact We rowed.
It,s almost the Last thing...
It Was the Last conversation We had.
I mean, if he,d,ve Listened to me...
- What?
- But I shOuLdn,t have gone Off...
I should,ve stayed With him.
He Came to see me and I Went Off and Left him.
In the arms Of a porn star.
Mate, dOn,t do this to yourself.
- HOW,d your mum take it?
- Oh!
I just...told her he Was dead.
I COuLdn,t...tell her about the...
- APPendage?
- Mm.
I didn,t Want to kill two Parents in One evening.
I mean, Why my mum ever took him back and gave him a second chance...
That,s love, isn,t it?
But she,s an intelligent woman.
Mm.
DOesn,t work Like that, believe me.
- you know, it,s...
- What?
- Nah, dOesn,t matter.
- NO, go On.
well, it,s Like me and Jase.
He Came Over to my place earlier and said he,d split up With his girlfriend.
If yOu,d asked me, I,d,ve said, ,There,s no Way I,m gonna give him a second chance.,
- But...
- When Was this?
This Was Why I Was Late coming into the hospital.
- I dOn,t believe it.
- you dOn,t know Why you love someone...
I mean I dO, yeah, but...
I also know how confused...
sorry, tell me exactly What he said.
That it,s all Over With Fi and that... yeah...
- he,s Certain it,s Over.
- And you believe him?
This time I dO, yeah.
I think he means it.
(Mani) HOW,s your mum?
- does she know?
- NO.
Mate, are yOu sure that,s a good idea?
There,s a real chance she,LL find Out.
Oh, shit.
We,re going to go Over to the reception.
Oh, hi.
We,ve met.
- Have you?
- NO, no, I dOn,t think so.

- Yeah, I,LL find my Way.
well, I,m glad, you know, We,ve had a chance to talk and stuff.
Yeah.
And me.
And I Can see Why Jase...
Why, you know...
Why he Likes you.
I mean, I,m not saying I Like you the Way he Likes you.
- I know What you,re saying.
- I mean if I Was, I would, but I,m not.
I,m not saying he is, but I know he does Or I think he does, but...
I definitely dOn,t. (Sniffs )
well, not With men.
SO...
well, you know What I,m saying.
SO you think I,m right to give him a second chance?
Yeah, maybe you,re right.
Maybe if yOu Were in love, you,d... yOu,d do the same, you know?
Night, mate.
See you Later.
I Wish someone would give me a second chance.
(Mani) I knew there Was something wrong.
(Jase ) Can We keep Our voices down?
- you haven,t finished With her, have you?
- Just Listen to me.
Why?
YOu think I Wanna hear any more Of your Lies?
It,s not that bloody simple.
It would be if yOu Weren,t such a Lying manipulative bastard.
I didn,t Lie.
NO wonder you haven,t returned any Of my calls.
- Mani.
- not interested.
- Just Listen.
- Piss Off back tO yOur fucking girlfriend.
- you think I Want this?
- DOn,t touch me!
I,m trying to sort this Out.
PLease!
FOr god,s sake, Mani, it,s not easy.
At Least now you dOn,t have tO worry about me.
YOu,ve just got to give me some time.
If I,m not around, there,s no fucking Pressure.
YOu Can sort Out who the hell you are and What the hell you Want With Fi.
And What about us?
There is no us, Jase.
look...
- Maybe in a year.
- you,LL have met someone.
I Can,t answer that, Jase.
- you dOn,t even know What you Want.
- But I know how I feel about you.
- And What about Fi?
- It,s not the same.
It,s different.
I Can,t explain.
She...
She dOesn,t deserve this.
Jesus.
look, I,m not blaming you.
OK?
YOu told me you Were in a relationship.
It,s my fault.
- But you said it.
YOu need time.
- But I dOn,t Want to lose you.
This isn,t What I Want, Jase.
I Can,t...
I Can,t do this.
YOu have tO decide.
I Can,t do it for you.
- sorry.
- That,s OK.
enjoy the food.
sorry, I just need to have a quick word With Fay.
- would you Like another drink, Fay?
- Thank yOu.
I,LL have a sherry.
The more I see Of men, the more I feel Like a woman.
- What are yOu trying to do to me?
- I,m Chatting.
That,s What women do.
YOu,re not going to tell her.
If yOu Carry On Like this, I WiLL.
I...
I just heard What happened.
- you What?
- Fay told me.
- you dOn,t deserve this.
- I know.
- you,re a lovely man, Nathan.
- you still think that?
Yes.
In spanish We say... ,If yOu Want the dog, accept the fleas.,
- I Like that.
- It,s true.
If yOu love someone, you must accept their faults.
well, I,ve got plenty Of fleas.
I,m really glad you Came.
I didn,t think you,d forgive me.
When I heard about your dad, I realised there are more important things in Life.
Yes, it certainly Puts things in perspective.
YOu still have feelings for her, dOn,t you?
NO.
NO.
ALL that,s Past.
OK.
- Hasta pronto, yes?
- Yes.
DO yOu know What that means?
- See you soon.
- Ah.
Hasta pronto.
- I,LL teach you spanish One day, OK?

Ah, muy bien.
Remember, there is no bad from which good does not come.
believe me, there is no One Less discreet than a transsexual With a glass Of sherry.
Ladies.
HOW are We?
Drinks?
Maybe not.
- HOW,s it going, then?
- Very well, considering.
Fay,s just been telling me a very interesting story.
- really?
- I think you know it.
I had to tell your mum.
about Fabian,s friend who,s M tO F.
MaLe-tO-femaLe transsexual.
- And she,s a Page three girl.
- And no One knows!
That story.
When you think about it, I dOn,t really see Why it matters.
NO.
well, if he,s the best man for the job.
nice to have met you.
He,s such a lovely woman.
- I know.
- She Was also telling me about YOLanda.
- who?
- The woman Dad Was With When he died.
Oh, yes.
- The Wedding planner.
- I thought she Was a porn star.
When things get tough.
But that night she Was definitely a Wedding planner.
- That,s Why she Was With Dad.
- who Was he gonna marry?
- you.
- But We Weren,t divorced.
I told him that, but... he loved you so much, Mum, he Wanted to renew your vows.
Oh, What a shame.
It sounded much more fun When your dad died shagging a porn star.
Nathan.
The hospital sent me a medical report.
- you knew everything.
- well...
I didn,t know she Was in The talented Mr lick Me.
DOn,t look at me Like that.
I spent a Lifetime With your dad.
I knew What he Was Like, love.
But then...
Why,d you take him back?
because I loved him.
I missed him.
After What he did?
When you get older, you,LL realise that a lot Of things happen in a relationship.
In the end, it isn,t the big things, you get through those...
It,s the everyday things, the little things, that,s What matters.
Life WOn,t be the same without him.
YOu,ve got me.
- Why WOuLdn,t you tell me?
- I didn,t Want to upset you.
- you,re a bit Like your dad.
- Er, no, I,m not.
It Wasn,t exactly that he avoided the truth.
more that his truth Wasn,t quite the same as everyone else,s.
DOn,t make a habit Of it.
It,LL ruin your Life.

He Wants you to be happy.
And that I Was the person to make you happy.
He Cares about us.
And he Cares about you, Fi.
That,s Why he gave me those pills.
I didn,t do this for some cheap thrill.
I did this for you.
TO make you happy.
Why do you need them?
It,s never been about sex With us.
YOu,ve always meant more to me.
I Want you to Want me.
I dO!
And What I dOn,t understand is Why you didn,t talk to me.
I know.
I should have done.
I need time to think.
I,m not sure We should Carry On.

- NO.
I,ve gone...as far as I Can.
- I dO love you, but...
- Let,s not have this conversation now.
It,s What I,m feeling, Jase.
because I COuLdn,t get a hard-On?

It,s lots Of things, Jase.
Yeah, well.
It Was my idea.

But you trying to give Jase a...

It Was really sweet.
particularly as I know...
well, I think I know...
What you feel about me.
It Was actually incredibly selfless.
That you Put him first.
Tried to help him sort things Out.
It made me realise What you,re really Like.
Right.
I think I,ve been...very unfair On you.
- some Of the things I said.
- I thought you hated me.
I did.
And sometimes I hated you so much beCau... (Sighs )

we've been married for five years-- you've never done that.
well, you know, people do that sometimes.
have you done it before?
yeah, a lot.
really?
you know, sure.
i'm a nurse, dummy.
- i do it to my patients.
- oh.
and today i was doing it and i thought,
"hey, maybe louie would like this."
well, i don't.
so please don't do it again, okay?
okay, so you don't want anything put up your ass but you wanna stick your dick up mine?
wait a minute, who said that?
what do you mean?
don't all guys fantasize about fucking women up the ass?
i don't.
really?
you don't?
no, i never understood that.
i mean, you're a millimeter away from the greatest place on earth.
why would you wanna go in someone's dried out little asshole?
okay, you're kind of putting down my asshole here.
i'm sure your asshole is fine. i've never even seen it.
yeah, well, you should.
why?
because i'm your wife.
you should see my asshole.
you should know everything about me.
what if you needed to identify me?
you mean-- you mean if you have an accident where your teeth are destroyed but your asshole survives?
all right, fine, i'll take a look. jesus.
- well, now-- - never going to happen.
"lucky louie" was taped before a live audience.
jesus!
hey, lucy.
lucy.
what, louie?
lucy, i need you to pick up your toys here.
no.
what do you mean, no?
i'm still playing with them.
no, you're not.
you're playing in there.
but those toys are waiting meanwhile.
lucy, i'm sick of picking up your toys.
i play with my toys and you pick them up-- that's my deal.
- oh my god, who do you think you are?
- i'm lucy.
okay. well, i'm your father, and i'm sick of this crap.
pick up your toys right now.
- i don't want to.
- well, yes.
- no!
no!
- ye do it right now. i'm not kidding.
hey, come on, she can pick up these later.
baby, go get washed up for dinner.
- okay, sweets?
- thanks, mama.
motherfucker.
- what?
- you just totally screwed me there.
every time i get home, it's this. i'm sick of all the yelling.
lucy, that's lisa's present for tomorrow for her birthday.
come on, you're messing it up. give it to me.
give it to me.
lucy, give me the present.
lucy, lucy, look at me, look at me.
stop unwrapping the present now.
okay, give me this.
- give it-- go away. - give it to me. it's mine.
- go away. go away, lucy.
- give it.
louie. jesus!
it's already ripped.
here, honey, you can play with this for a while, but then give it to mama later, so i can rewrap it, okay?
thank you, mama.
you've gotta stop undercutting me.
i'm not trying to undercut you.
i mean, what is your problem?
i'm not the problem, she is.
the kid is a fucking asshole.
louie... that's awful!
obviously, she's going through something.
yeah, tell me about it. she used to be cute, now she sucks.
stop saying that.
i will if she stops being a fucking asshole.
seriously, i never used to get the babies-in-the-garbage thing, but now i understand it.
i'm not gonna throw her in the garbage.
she'd probably find her way home and whine to you about it.
stop it, stop it, stop it.
i said to stop it.
why don't you go play with the other kids, huh?
i don't like them.
i don't like this party.
lucy, that's not nice.
sorry, ellen.
so is everyone ready for the piñata?
yay!
okay, kids, gather round.
ready?
'cause here we go!
go ahead, walter.
yay!
and here's one for you, lisa, and here's one for you, and here's one for you, lucy.
- i want more candy.
- no, lucy.
- lucy!
- lucy, put it down.
hey!
i'm so sorry, ellen.
she's just excited.
yes, well, this piñata is very expensive.
it's from mexico.
- did someone say "cake"?
- yeah!
- i want the cake.
- wait wait wait.
come on. they didn't light the candles yet.
- i want the cake!
let me see!
hey, what are you doing still here?
i took the day off to spend with lucy.
- oh.
- yeah, look, i'm sorry that i didn't see before what was going on, but obviously, at the party she was really acting out and i'm staying here because this behavior has gotta stop.
good. good, so what are you gonna do?
well, for starters, i baked her a cake.
uh, isn't that stupid?
i just don't think your yelling is doing her any good.
what she needs is some special attention, okay?
and i think it will do her a world of good to have some mama time.
- mama.
- hey, lucy boo, guess what?
- i'm gonna stay today all day.
- hey, cake.
yeah yeah, mama baked you that cake
- and later on we're gonna have some.
- yay!
- yay, good.
- i want cake right now.
yeah, but buddy, we shouldn't have cake for breakfast, right?
you said i could have cake.
yes, later, but right now how about making you some nice eggs?
no, i want cake.
how are you doing?
okay, you know what, lucy?
let's have some cake!
wow...
- cake for breakfast, huh?
- yeah, you know what?
i think that part of the problem is all she ever hears from us is the word "no."
okay?
every once in a while, she has to hear "yes."
cake, mama.
hurry up.
yes yes.
huh?
isn't this fun?
aren't you glad that mama stayed home today?
it tastes like poop.
- what?
- it's poop. i don't like it.
lucy, mama made that cake for you.
i baked it with love and i gave it to you.
you gave me poop.
- oh my god.
- uh-huh.
you're right.
she's a fucking asshole.
nice jacket, faggot.
lucy. hey, lucy, come put on your jacket.
- it's getting cold.
- no.
i don't even know where to start with this discipline shit.
where do you start?
you hit her.
that's a start and a finish.
i didn't know you hit your kids.
why would i hit my kids?
i love my kids.
just seems like you've got a rotten one.
so why don't you kick her ass?
your problem is that you treat her like a kid.
they don't like that. you gotta talk to them eye to eye, like equals. you respect them-- they respect you.
- papa, i want a juice box.
- okay.
hey, lucy. how have you been, all right?
you're ugly.
hey, are you all right?
huh?
yeah yeah.
i wanna go home now.
well, there's nothing wrong with her eyesight.
hey, guys, can i talk to you for a second?
- what's that?
- listen, uh... we've been having kind of a behavior problem with lucy lately.
yeah.
anyway, i just-- your lisa is so great, you know?
she's so well-behaved.
how do you discipline her?
lisa is naturally well-behaved.
we haven't had a problem with her.
- oh.
- she has excellent judgment.
her first word was "please."
wow. well, okay, thanks.
hey.
- timeouts.
- what?
when lisa turned four, she was a nightmare.
now my daddy used to hit me and i don't wanna pass that on, so we used timeouts.
they work.
see, i get confused 'cause i thought i heard
- that those are bad now.
- no no, do timeouts.
just put her alone somewhere, but not in a bedroom-- that's a vacation.
- well, for how long?
- just use her age.
so she's four-- do it for four minutes.
geez, thanks a lot, man.
- hey, why didn't ellen say that?
okay.
so what do you two have planned for today?
- i gotta take lucy to the park.
- mmm.
i don't wanna go to the park.
okay, where do you wanna go?
nowhere.
lucy, why are you being so nasty?
'cause you're stupid.
lucy?
!
what did you say?
i said you're stupid, very stupid.
okay, lucy.
now say you're sorry.
i'm notsorry.
lucy, if you don't apologize, you're gonna have a timeout.
- what?
wait a minute.
- don't.
i am... what's a timeout?
it means that you have to be alone somewhere until i say so.
- i don't want to.
- okay,
- then say you're sorry.
- no.
- okay, here we go. timeout.
- oh, louie.
- can i just talk to you for one second?
- no, this is her timeout.
- i don't want a timeout!
- well...
- too bad.
- oh...
- look, i-- i don't think this is a good idea. - honey, go to work.
go to work right now.
i got this.
just please go, now!
- go.
- okay, fine, i'll go.
get back in there.
get back in there.
- get in, get in, get in.
- let me go!
you know what?
i just wanna talk-- okay, please be nice.

- you gotta come out now.
- only if i don't have to say sorry.
- sure, it's fine.
- okay.
no, wait wait wait.
you gotta say you're sorry first.
- no!
- then you can't come out.
i don't wanna come out.
what the fuck am i doing?
hey, man, listen, i ran into a problem with the timeout.
lucy won't come out of the closet.
- the closet?
- it's-- whatever. look, it's just that she's in there, she won't come out and she hasn't said sorry yet. i don't know what to do.
you put your child in the closet?
man, i can't help you.

lucy?
lucy, unchain the door right now.
lucy, what are you doing?
lu-- lu-- lucy, you un-- open the door right now!

- no, just-- i- lucy-- i-- the timeout- i don't care.
- just go, please.
- okay, good. yeah, thanks.

oh, christ.
lucy, that was really bad.
you could have been hurt.
oh, lucy, i'm really mad at you right now.
i'm mad at you.
okay, so what are we gonna do?
i don't know.
are you gonna come out of there?
no.
do you wanna come in here?
okay.
oh, lucy, i'm sorry.
this isn't your fault.
i'm supposed to know how to do this and i don't.
i think i really rewed it up.
i'm sorry.
i love you, papa.

- hey.
- how are you?
- we're great.
good.
- so how is it going?
- great.
something great happened.
- really?
- yeah.
okay, it started out kind of bad. she locked me out.
- i had to come in the window and all this stuff-- - what?
!
never mind.
the important thing is, we were-- we were in the closet together and she-- we had this moment.
i just think we had a breakthrough.
wow, that's so great.
lucy?
hey, lucy?
cut-- cut that out.
what are you doing?
- i said i don't like it.
- well, you don't just shovel it
- on the floor.
- yes, i do.
after all that, i didn't get anywhere with her.
well, don't feel bad.
i didn't do any better.
i guess we just got a shitty kid.
man. well, at least she'll do all right.
i mean, assholes rule the world.
she'll probably grow up and be rich.
yeah, she'd better buy us a big fucking house.
hello, lou.
- is lucy home?
- why?
i'd like to speak to her, please.
hey, lucy.
"lucy, when i saw you yesterday, you said something very hurtful to me.
i didn't like it and it made me feel bad.
and i need you to know that."
i'm sorry.
- thank you.
- okay.
she's a good kid.
So what happened there?
What do you mean?
Well, why did you get all weird when I put my finger up your ass?
Let's, uh...
let's back up.
Why did you put your finger in my ass?
I don't know.
We've been married for five years...
you've never done that.
Well, you know, people do that sometimes.
Have you done it before?
Yeah, a lot.
Really?
You know, sure.
I'm a nurse, dummy.
- I do it to my patients.
- Oh.
And today I was doing it and I thought,
"Hey, maybe Louie would like this."
Well, I don't.
So please don't do it again, okay?
Okay, so you don't want anything put up your ass but you wanna stick your dick up mine?
Wait a minute, who said that?
What do you mean?
Don't all guys fantasize about fucking women up the ass?
I don't.
Really?
You don't?
No, I never understood that.
I mean, you're a millimeter away from the greatest place on earth.
Why would you wanna go in someone's dried-out little asshole?
Okay, you're kind of putting down my asshole here.
I'm sure your asshole is fine.
I've never even seen it.
Yeah, well, you should.
Why?
Because I'm your wife.
You should see my asshole.
You should know everything about me.
What if you needed to identify me?
You mean... you mean if you have an accident where your teeth are destroyed but your asshole survives?
All right, fine, I'll take a look.
Jesus.
- Well, now...
- Never going to happen.
"Lucky Louie" was taped before a live audience.
Jesus!
Hey, Lucy.
Lucy.
What, Louie?
Lucy, I need you to pick up your toys here.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm still playing with them.
No, you're not.
You're playing in there.
But those toys are waiting meanwhile.
Lucy, I'm sick of picking up your toys.
I play with my toys and you pick them up... that's my deal.
- Oh my God, who do you think you are?
- I'm Lucy.
Okay.
Well, I'm your father, and I'm sick of this crap.
Pick up your toys right now.
- I don't want to.
- Well, yes.
- No!
No!
- Yes, do it right now.
I'm not kidding.
Hey, come on, she can pick up these later.
Baby, go get washed up for dinner.
- Okay, sweets?
- Thanks, Mama.
Motherfucker.
- What?
- You just totally screwed me there.
Every time I get home, it's this.
I'm sick of all the yelling.
Lucy, that's Lisa's present for tomorrow for her birthday.
Come on, you're messing it up.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
Lucy, give me the present.
Lucy, Lucy, look at me, look at me.
Stop unwrapping the present now.
Okay, give me this.
- Give it... go away.
- Give it to me.
It's mine.
- Go away.
Go away, Lucy.
- Give it.
Louie.
Jesus!
It's already ripped.
Here, honey, you can play with this for a while, but then give it to Mama later, so I can rewrap it, okay?
Thank you, Mama.
You've gotta stop undercutting me.
I'm not trying to undercut you.
I mean, what is your problem?
I'm not the problem, she is.
The kid is a fucking asshole.

Hey!
I'm so sorry, Ellen.
She's just excited.
Yes, well, this piñata is very expensive.
It's from Mexico.
- Did someone say "cake"?
- Yeah!

Come on.
They didn't light the candles yet.

Whatever.
Look, it's just that she's in there, she won't come out and she hasn't said sorry yet.
I don't know what to do.
You put your child in the closet?
Man, I can't help you.
Shit!
Lucy!
Lucy?
Lucy, unchain the door right now.
Lucy, what are you doing?
Lu...
Lu...
Lucy, you un...

Oh, shit.

- Just go, please.
- Okay, good.
Yeah, thanks.
Lucy.
Lucy, stop eating that ice cream.
Stop.
I said stop eating that ice cream.
Lucy!
No, don't go in the closet.
Don't go in the closet.
No no no, don't go in there, Lucy.
Argh!
Oh.
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Oh, God.
Come on, fellows.

Oh, hi.

So how is it going over there?
Really good.
Things are really going well.
Ugh.
Louie, don't answer the phone when you're taking a shit.
Sorry.
Oh, Christ.
Lucy, that was really bad.
You could have been hurt.
Oh, Lucy, I'm really mad at you right now.
I'm mad at you.
Okay, so what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
Are you gonna come out of there?
No.
Do you wanna come in here?
Okay.
Oh, Lucy,
I'm sorry.
This isn't your fault.
I'm supposed to know how to do this and I don't.
I think I really screwed it up.
I'm sorry.
I love you, Papa.
Papa, can I have more of this?
Sure.
You want some more veggies and potatoes too?
- No, thank you.
- Okay.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- We're great.
Good.
- So how is it going?
- Great.
Something great happened.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay, it started out kind of bad.
She locked me out.
I had to come in the window and all this stuff...
- What?
!
- Never mind.
The important thing is, we were... we were in the closet together and she...
we had this moment.
I just think we had a breakthrough.
Wow, that's so great.
Lucy?
Hey, Lucy?
Cut... cut that out.
What are you doing?
- I said I don't like it.
- Well, you don't just shovel it
- on the floor.
- Yes, I do.
After all that, I didn't get anywhere with her.
Well, don't feel bad.
I didn't do any better.
I guess we just got a shitty kid.
Man.
Well, at least she'll do all right.
I mean, assholes rule the world.
She'll probably grow up and be rich.
Yeah, she'd better buy us a big fucking house.
Hello, Lou.
- Is Lucy home?
- Why?
I'd like to speak to her, please.
Hey, Lucy.
"Lucy, when I saw you yesterday, you said something very hurtful to me.
I didn't like it and it made me feel bad.
And I need you to know that."
I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
She's a good kid.
Man:
WHERE'S MY GREATEST HITS OF THE SIXITES?
I JUST LISTENED TO IT LAST WEEK.
Woman:
DID YOU LEAVE IT AT HOME?
[HORN BLARES]
WHOA!
WHOA.
HUH.
SORRY.
SORRY.
TOO MUCH LIPSTICK?
OH, MAN.
GOOD GIRL, SALLY.
GOOD GIRL.
MMM.
OH.
SO MUCH FOR OUR PRISTINE WILDERNESS EXPERIENCE.
YEAH, WELL, I TOLD YOU THIS IS AN ADVENTURE,
WHICH BASICALLY IS A VACATION WITH MEAT ON IT.
AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE YOUR MEAT, DARLING, I REALLY DO.
I WAS JUST HOPING FOR SOME ROOM SERVICE AND A GOOD WINE.
[SOFT ROCK PLAYS]
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND THESE SKINNY LITTLE WHITE BOY SINGERS YOU LIKE SO MUCH?
MARRIED ONE, DIDN'T I?
YEAH, BUT I DON'T SING THAT NEW CRAP
IN THE SHOWER, DO I, HUH?
DAD ALWAYS SAID THE GREAT MUSIC DIED--
Both:
THE DAY THEY DREAMED UP DISCO.
THAT'S RIGHT.
I--I COULD LICK THAT OFF.
AND KEEP BOTH EYES ON THE ROAD?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M STILL JIGGY FROM LAST NIGHT.
[CHUCKLES]
PINEY WOOD, STARRY SKIES.
IT'S JUST--JUST THE RIGHT TIMING
TO MAKE A BABY, I THINK.
YEAH.
WE BOTH KEEP SINGING THAT SONG, HUH?
MM-HMM.
Mary:
HERE WE ARE.
AH, BOY.
BACON, EGGS, HOMEMADE BISCUITS.
[LAUGHS]
I CAN EAT THIS WAY EVERY MORNING
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE, NEXT YEAR.
[LAUGHS]
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE REAL OREGON, BABY.
OH, YEAH.
IF THE RUMORS ARE TRUE
AND I TAKE A TRANSFER TO JERSEY,
AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE THIS TRIP, HUH?
MM-HMM.
[YOUNG MAN CACKLES]
SO GLAD WE GOT A TASTE OF THE WILDLIFE.
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
[JUKEBOX PLAYS COUNTRY MUSIC]
Man:
HEY, YOU KNOW, WE COULD TAKE A SHORTCUT TO TOKETEE FALLS.
CLARK.
YEAH, WE TAKE 58 TWO MILES EAST,
AND GO SOUTH ON THIS COUNTY ROAD.
OH, THAT LOOKS PRETTY EMPTY.
THINK THE WORD IS WILDERNESS,
AS IN NO GAS STATIONS, NO RESTROOMS,
NO MOTELS WITH SOFT BEDS.
NO, NO, WE'LL FIND ONE.
WE'LL FIND ONE.
HERE.
JUST CUT ACROSS THIS HIGHWAY HERE.
CAN'T BE MUCH FURTHER TO TOKETEE.
SEE?
HUH?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ROADS WITH NO NUMBERS, MAN.
BLAZE A TRAIL.
FEEL THE LAND.
[CHUCKLES]
YEAH, LIKE WE'RE PIONEER STOCK.
YOU'RE A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, CLARK.
THAT'S WHAT I DO, HONEY.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I AM.
SORRY, YOU COME FROM A LONG LINE
OF HUNTER-GATHERERS.
[GASPS]
JUST SOME GUY'S BODY
BROKEN FOR YOU AND FOR MANY.
OH, WE'RE TALKING MASS CULTURE, SUGAR MUFFIN.
[GASPS]
[CACKLES]
[INDISTINCT]
Clark:
YOU KIDDING ME?
[SCOFFS] NOW WHAT?
[BIRDS CAWING]
[ENGINE SHUTS OFF]
[MARY GROANS]
CLARK, I GAVE UP TEACHING SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THIS.
PLEASE TELL ME WE'RE NOT LOST.
WE'RE NOT LOST.
WE'RE JUST IN MID-PROCESS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN A ROAD MARKED LIKE THAT.
WHERE ARE THE PHONE LINES?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW?
UH, NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM IN A WHILE.
WELL, HOW LONG IS A WHILE?
I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, 10, 20 MILES.
WANT MY ADVICE?
NO, BUT I SUPPOSE I'LL GET IT ANYWAY.
YOU KNOW, I REALLY CAN'T STAND IT WHEN YOU ROLL YOUR EYES LIKE THAT.
ROLL MY EYES LIKE WHAT?
OH, YOU KNOW, LIKE I'M SOME OLD DOG
THAT FARTED UNDER THE DINNER TABLE.
GO ON, GO ON.
IT'S YOUR NICKEL.
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
LET'S GO BACK WHILE THERE'S STILL TIME.
[CHUCKLES]
YEAH, SURE, NOW ALL YOU NEED IS A SIGN THAT SAYS "REPENT."
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH YOU TEACHERS.
YOU'RE ALWAYS TIED TO YOUR LESSON PLANS.
THAT'S IT.
IT'S GOT TO BE THE RIGHT FORK.
THIS IS-- THAT'S SOUTH.
YEAH, I CAN SMELL TOKETEE FALLS FROM HERE.
THAT'S THE RANCH ROAD.
MUST BE.
A RANCH ROAD WITH A STRIPED LINE?
WELL, YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW WELL-OFF SOME OF THESE RANCHERS ARE.
MONEY IN THE LAND, MY DAD ALWAYS SAID.
[CAR DOOR CLOSES]
BABY...
LET'S GO BACK AND FIND A NICE HOT TUB
AND A COLD MOJITO.
[ENGINE STARTS]
REVERSE IS RIGHT THERE, BABY.
I KNOW, HONEY.
WRONG--REVERSE IS JUST ANOTHER WORD
FOR GOING BACKWARDS.
OK?
BESIDES, IT'S NOT LIKE THE YELLOW LINE IS GONNA RUN OUT.
Radio: * WHOO *
* HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY *
* WHOO!
*
* SHAKE IT UP, PRETTY BABY *
WELL, OK, HUH.
DOESN'T MATTER.
THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A COUNTY ROAD.
WE'LL JUST HEAD-- KEEP HEADING SOUTH, SOUTHEAST.
[SIGHS]
[ANIMALS HOOTING, CHIRPING]
OH, CLARK!
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, OK?
WE'RE NOT LOST.
WE'RE NOT LOST!
THE ROAD'LL OPEN UP AGAIN
OVER THE NEXT HILL PROBABLY.
[SIGHS]
WE'RE NOT LOST.
[MUSIC BECOMES DISTORTED]
OH!
THAT'S IT.
I'M CALLING THE AUTO CLUB.
IN 15 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
YOU'VE NEVER ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS EVER.
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.
[DIALING PHONE] GAVE YOU THIS CAR OF HIS, AND THE DAY HE DID,
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN 50,000 EXTRA MILES
FROM GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES.
WELL, YOU KNOW, ONE MAN'S CIRCLE
IS ANOTHER MAN'S WANDERLUST.
YEAH, WELL, I'M ALL OUT OF LUST,
AND WE'VE WANDERED LONG ENOUGH.
[BEEP]
[BUZZING]
[GROANS]
[GRUNTING]
CLARK.
CLARK, I GIVE.
OK?
YOU'RE A MAN AMONG MEN.
I SAY THIS WITH THE GREATEST RESPECT.
TURN THE DAMN CAR AROUND.
HONEY, HONEY, HONEY,
I CAN'T RISK TURNING THE CAR AROUND NOW.
THE ROAD IS TOO NARROW, THE SHOULDERS ARE SOFT.
WE'LL GET STUCK.
OK?
I GOT US INTO THIS, I WILL GET US OUT.
TRUST ME.
[SCOFFS]
[OWL HOOTING]
CLARK, IT'S UM--
IT'S GETTING LATE.
WE'VE GOT TO TURN BACK.
OH, JUST STOP IT, MARY, ALL RIGHT?
JUST PUT DOWN THE CHALK, WILL YOU?
NOT SOME TOLKIEN FANTASY HERE.
WE'LL BE FINE.
WE JUST GOT TO STAY THE COURSE.
STAY THE COURSE.
YOU CAN'T FIND THE COURSE, CLARK.
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE?
WE'RE IN TROUBLE HERE.
JUST LOOK.
CAN'T YOU SEE IT?
UH, I SEE A SIGN.
CAN YOU READ IT?
CAN YOU READ IT?
YEAH, IT SAYS, "IF YOU CAME THIS FAR,
YOU REALLY SCREWED UP."
[SQUEAKING]
HUH.
Mary:
THIS HAS TO BE A JOKE.
WELL, MAYBE NOT.
A TOWN CALLED ROCK AND ROLL HEAVEN?
WELL, WHY NOT?
THERE'S TRUTH AND CONSEQUENCES, NEW MEXICO,
THERE'S SHARK, NEVADA,
THERE'S EVEN A TOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA CALLED INTERCOURSE.
I MEAN, WHY NOT ROCK AND ROLL HEAVEN?
I MEAN, MAYBE IT WAS BUILT BY HIPPIES BACK IN THE 60s.
I DON'T KNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT WE'VE FOUND SOME
HONEST-TO-GOD PAVEMENT AGAIN, HONEY.
YOU MADE THAT UP.
WHAT?
INTERCOURSE, PENNSYLVANIA.
NO, NO, NO, I SWEAR, IT'S--
I'VE DONE INTERCOURSE...
PENNSYLVANIA.
HUH?
YEAH.
[SNICKERS]
WE'LL DO THE NEW ROAD.
BE CAREFUL.
OOH.
AH.
AH, NORMAN ROCKWELL'S BIRTHPLACE.
HAS TO BE.
HUH.
WHERE'S THE SMOKE?
THERE SHOULD BE SMOKE FROM A CHIMNEY SOMEWHERE.
YOU KNOW, WE COULD WIN
A CONDO IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN,
AND YOU'D BE WORRYING ABOUT APHIDS.
LET'S TURN AROUND.
WHAT?
WHY?
I DON'T LIKE IT.
THAT'S ALL.
LOOK AT THAT HOUSE.
UH, YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
YEAH.
IT'S LIKE THE CANDY HOUSE IN HANSEL AND GRETEL.
OH, COME ON.
NO, I HID UNDER MY BED FOR A WEEK
AFTER MOM READ ME THAT STORY.
LET'S JUST TURN AROUND.
THE ROADS ARE WIDE ENOUGH.
LOOK AT THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE, HUH?
[SIGHS]
I MEAN, IF YOU WANNA BUY A SOUVENIR,
BUY A T-SHIRT.
A T-SHIRT!
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, CLARK.
THAT'S HOW MEN ALWAYS DO IT.
DO WHAT?
GET YOUR WAY.
NOT BY BEING RIGHT, BY BEING RELENTLESS.
OH, YOU'RE GETTING OUT NOW?
YEAH!
OK.
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.
[STARTS CAR]
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.
ONE T-SHIRT.
5 MINUTES.
NO.
WHEN DO I GET TO CHOOSE, CLARK, HUH?
WHEN DO WE TAKE THE TRIP I'D LIKE?
WHEN DO WE MOVE TO A DIFFERENT PLACE FOR MY JOB?
YOU CAN TEACH ANYWHERE.
I'M GETTING A HEADACHE.
COME ON.
IT'S 19 MILES BACK TO HIGHWAY 58
OVER THE SAME CRAPPY ROAD-- 19 MILES ISN'T SO MUCH.
BUT WHEN YOU TACK ON 50 MILES IT'S GONNA TAKE
TO GO AROUND THE FOREST,
ONCE WE GET TO HIGHWAY 58--
YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE WE HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH.
WELL, THIS TICKS ME OFF, YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, YOU TAKE ONE LOOK-- IT'S A NICE LITTLE TOWN.
IT'S GOT A CUTE LITTLE NAME.
AND SUDDENLY, YOU'RE REMINDED OF--OF LIKE...
MYSTIC RIVER OR SOME DAMN THING,
AND YOU WANNA GO BACK.
YEAH.
WHERE IF WE JUST STAYED ON THE SAME ROAD THROUGH TOWN,
WE JUST CUT SOUTH, DUE SOUTH...
IT'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN A HALF AN HOUR TO TOKETEE FALLS--
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID BACK AT THE DINER, REMEMBER?
[HORN HONKS]
WHOO!
[CHEERING]
Woman:
PEACE!
WE LOVE YOU!
Man:
MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR!
FAR OUT.
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING FOR THE TOURISTS, I'M THINKING.
ALL RIGHT.
ONE SOUVENIR AND WE'RE GONE, PROMISE.
FIRST WICKED WITCH WE SEE,
I'M GONNA BACK UP MUSTANG SALLY ALL THE WAY TO PORTLAND.
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.
PLEASE?
PLEASE?
OK.
ONE T-SHIRT, NOTHING MORE.
OK.
NOTHING MORE!
ALL RIGHT!
OK.
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE SURE.
[GROANS] CLARK, I SAID OK.
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL.
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME IF I DECLINE
TO PUT MY CHEERLEADER SKIRT ON AND YELL, "GO, CLARK, GO."
JEEZ.
YOU ARE IN SOME MOOD, BOY.
YOU WOULD LOOK CUTE IN A CHEERLEADING SKIRT, THOUGH.
HEY!
LOOK AT THAT.
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
HUH.
HMM!
[BELCHES]
HOW YOU DOING?
OK.
NO, NO.
COME THIS WAY.
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT, CLARK.
I KNOW YOU DO.
WHAT?
IT'S LIKE THE TOWN IN THE TWILIGHT ZONE.
"A PECULIAR LITTLE TOWN."
REMEMBER?
COME ON.
YOU WATCH TV-LAND CONSTANTLY.
AAH.
CLARK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANT A COKE.
CLARK.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
[SIGHS] I KNOW YOU.
YOU'VE NO INTENTION OF LEAVING THIS PLACE
UNTIL YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF YOU'RE NOT INTIMIDATED.
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING?
ICED TEA, OR--
I WANNA LEAVE.
WHAT'S TO BE AFRAID OF, HONEY?
WHO KNOWS WHAT GOES ON IN THE BACKWOODS HERE.
THESE GUYS, THEY COULD HAVE 12 WIVES, DATE THEIR SISTERS--
I DON'T KNOW!
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
CLARK, I'M NOT STAYING HERE BY MYSELF.
CLARK.
OK.
GO PISS ON YOUR HYDRANT, THEN WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
THEY LOOK FAMILIAR.
[BOTH LAUGH]
WHO DO WE KNOW'S MOVED TO ROCK AND ROLL, OREGON, TO BE STREET PEOPLE?
[TWEEDLE-DEE-DEE PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
HA HA!
LOOK AT THIS.

OH.
WOW.
THIS IS FABULOUS.
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK...
THEY HAVE THE MOONGLOWS,
FRANKIE LYMON AND THE TEENAGERS,
TWEEDLE-DEE-DEE.
OH, TWEEDLE-DEE-DEE.
WOW!
OH, GOD,

JUST TAKEOUT DRINKS, REMEMBER?
YEAH.
MM-HMM.

BUT--BUT...
MARY, I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.
LOOK AT THE MENU.
I MEAN,YOU GOT
BIG BOPPER BURGER AND SUZIE CUE FRIES.
COME ON, WOMAN.
WHERE'S YOUR DAMN SOUL, HUH?
DRINKS, CLARK.
WE DISCUSSED THIS IN THE CAR.
DRINKS ONLY.
UH--AHEM-- WHAT'LL IT BE?
CAN I HAVE A COKE, PLEASE?
LARGE.
YOU OUGHT TO TRY THE CHERRY PIE.
RICK JUST MADE IT.
AH.
ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD.
[CRY BABY PLAYING ON JUKEBOX]
* I KNOW SHE TOLD YOU *
JUST A COKE...
TO GO.
THAT REDHEAD OVER THERE.
* ALL I KNOW IS THAT SHE LEFT YOU *
[SIGHS] STOP STARING AT HER.
YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE BOY TRYING TO PEEK UP SOMEBODY'S SKIRT IN STUDY HALL.
NO.
IS SHE, LIKE, THE SPLITTING IMAGE OF JANIS JOPLIN,
OR AM I CRAZY?
* CRY BABY *
* CRY BABY *
* OH, HONEY, WELCOME BACK HOME *
* DON'T YOU KNOW *
[NEEDLE SKIPS, MUSIC STOPS]
HEY, MARY?
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT?
YOU'RE SWEATING, FOR CRYIN' OUT LOUD.
IT'S NOT ANYTHING TO HAVE A PANIC ATTACK OVER.
LOSING MY MOTHER'S DIAMONDS LAST YEAR,
THAT'S WORTH HAVING A PANIC ATTACK OVER.
JANIS JOPLIN IS DEAD, IN L.A., AN OVERDOSE.
WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE?
THE JONESTOWN GLEE CLUB?
UH...
SHE'S A GROUPIE,
AND THIS IS LIKE A FIFTIES PLACE.
THEY'RE PLAYING DRESS-UP, THAT'S ALL.
TELL YOU WHAT, WE'LL ENJOY OUR PIE
AND WE'LL GET OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?
HI.
COULD I MAKE MY COKE A MALT?
WELL, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT, STUD.
WELL, IN THAT CASE, MAKE MINE VANILLA.
AND HOW DID I KNOW THAT?
Clark:
I MEAN, NOBODY MAKES MALTS ANYMORE, YOU KNOW?
IT'S ALL LATTE, MOCHA, GELATO.
ANY OLD EXCUSE TO CHARGE YOU 5 BUCKS A POP.
[CLARK FADES OUT]
[BLENDER STARTS]
GO ON, DOLL, SERVE 'EM UP.
Waitress:
JUST THE ONES WITH THE BIG BICEPS.
Clark:
YEAH?
THANK YOU.
DON'T MENTION IT.
SO HOW DO YOU GET YOUR LIPSTICK TO MATCH YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT?
YOU START WITH THE LIPSTICK, ALWAYS.
CLARK...
YOUR PIE IS HERE.
AH!
GREAT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL THIS COWBOY TWICE.
YEAH.
WHOO!
OH, YEAH.
OH!
OH!
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
MMM.
WHO MADE IT?
RICK, TAKE A BOW.
[CLAPPING] HELL OF A PIE, MAN.
WOW.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN TO MAKE PIE LIKE THAT?
ME AND MOM, WE HUNG AROUND THE KITCHEN A LOT.
THAT'S YOU IN A NUTSHELL, RICK.
MAMA'S BOY.
GIVE ME MY HAT BACK!
[LAUGHS]
GIVE ME THAT HAT.
NEVER!
COME HERE!
WHOO!
OH, AND YOU RUN LIKE A MAMA'S BOY.
RICK?
OZZIE AND HARRIET?
RICKY--

RICKY NELSON.

[CACKLES]
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE'S-- DEAD.
I THINK, LIKE, 20 YEARS.
A PLANE CRASH, HIM AND HIS WHOLE BAND.
HEY!
WHOO!
CUT THAT OUT.
CLARK, UH...
I THINK I LEFT MY WALLET IN THE CAR.
WOULD YOU GO GET IT FOR ME, PLEASE?
THE PINK ONE.
IT MIGHT BE UNDER THE SEAT.
YOU GO.
IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT, I'LL COME HELP YOU.
RIGHT.
I'LL GO LOOK IN THE CAR.
MM-HMM.
DON'T LET THAT PIE GET COLD NOW.
[LOUD GUITAR CHORD]
[FEEDBACK]
[FEEDBACK FADES]
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU, HONEY.
THEY'RE JUST STARTING TO TUNE UP FOR THE CONCERT TONIGHT.
WE HAVE A CONCERT HERE IN TOWN ALMOST EVERY NIGHT.
I'LL BET YOU DO.
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
HEY.
HOWDY, MA'AM.
[PRETTY WOMAN PLAYING]
* PRETTY WOMAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET *
THAT'S ROY ORBISON AND BUDDY HOLLY.
SOLID TUNE, I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.
BUT IT AIN'T NO RAVE ON.
* I DON'T BELIEVE YOU, YOU'RE NOT THE TRUTH *
THEY CALL THAT LOSING YOUR CHERRY.
[LAUGHS]
WELL, DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT THAT, SWEET THING.
WELCOME.
I AIN'T SEEN YOU AROUND THESE PARTS BEFORE.
I, UM--MY HUSBAND AND I, WE'RE JUST TOURISTS VISITING.
WE--WE HAVE TO LEAVE.
YOU AND YOUR MAN OUGHT TO HANG AROUND A WHILE.
YOU OUGHT TO STAY FOR THE CONCERT TONIGHT.
WE PUT ON ONE HELL OF A SHOW IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU, MA'AM, AND NOT JUST FOR THE NIGHT.
STAY A SPELL.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
LET ME, UM...
LET ME ASK MY HUSBAND.

[GRUNTS]
OH, MY GOD.
[SIGHS] LET'S DO THIS, OK?
HEY, WHO HURT YOU?
CHERRY PIE.
CLARK.
GET US OUT OF HERE.
WE'LL BE FINE.
NOT A SINGLE ONE.
WHAT?
POWER LINES.
WHEREVER THEY GET THEIR POWER,
IT'S NOT FROM OREGON POWER AND LIGHT.
[BOTH GASP]
YOU ALL RIGHT?
HUH?
BACK UP.
TURN AROUND.
GO--GO AROUND.
[ENGINE STALLING]
GO ON, GO AROUND!
Mary:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'VE SEEN 'EM.
DO YOU WANT TO BE THEM?
[PLAYING STAR-SPANGLED BANNER]
[SIREN BLARES]
WELCOME TO TOWN, BOTH OF YOU.
HOPE YOU CAN, UH, STAY A WHILE.
WE'RE REAL NEIGHBORLY,
AND WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN.
I'M THE MAYOR AROUND THESE PARTS.
THE NAME'S ELVIS PRESLEY.
DRIVING AWAY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE YOU NO GOOD ANYHOW.
HIGHWAY DON'T GO NOWHERE BUT THE UNICOI SWAMP.
NO ROADS IN THERE, MA'AM.
THERE'S A LOT OF POLK SALAD
AND QUICKSAND AND OTHER THINGS.
BEARS.
BEARS.
YEP.
AND OTHER THINGS.
IF WE STAY FOR THE SHOW--
THE SHOW?
OH, YOU GOT TO STAY FOR THE SHOW.
WE REALLY ROCK.
YOU'LL SEE IF WE DON'T.
AIN'T NOTHING BUT A STONE FACT.
IF WE STAY FOR THE SHOW,
CAN WE GO WHEN IT'S OVER?
YOU KNOW, MA'AM,
WE'RE WAY OUT IN THE BOONIES OUT HERE,
AND ATTRACTING AN AUDIENCE CAN BE KIND OF SLOW WORK,
ALTHOUGH ONCE THEY HEAR US,
EVERYBODY STAYS AROUND FOR MORE.
WE WAS KIND OF HOPING
YOU MIGHT STICK AROUND YOURSELVES FOR A WHILE,
SEE A FEW SHOWS,
AND JUST KIND OF...
ENJOY OUR HOSPITALITY.
I THINK YOU MIGHT EVEN DECIDE...
YOU WANT TO SETTLE DOWN.
SO WHERE DO YOU WANT TO SIT?
OVER THERE.
HMM.
HI.
HI.
I--I'M CECE PRYOR.
MARY RIVINGHAM.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND CLARK.
HI.
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
YOUR HAND.
FRANKIE DID IT.
FRANKIE LYMAN.
EVERYONE SAYS HE WAS THE SWEETEST GUY
YOU'D EVER WANT TO MEET...
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.
HE ONLY TURNED MEAN WHEN HE CAME HERE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T CARE.
I JUST WISH HE HAD GOTTEN AWAY.
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.
BESIDES...
CRYSTAL TAKES CARE OF ME.
YOU KNOW, SHE'LL FIX YOU UP IF YOU WANT.
YOU DON'T NEED TO LOSE NO FINGERS
TO WANT TO GET STONED IN THIS TOWN.
OH, MY WIFE AND I DON'T USE DRUGS.
YOU WILL.
[INDISTINCT TALKING]
GOOD EVENING, ROCK AND ROLL HEAVEN!
GET YOUR SEATS FAST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
AND HOLD ONTO YOUR CHAIRS,
BECAUSE THERE'S GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT.
HOW LONG DO THEY GO ON?
A LONG TIME.
I MEAN, THE SHOW WILL BE OVER AT MIDNIGHT.
IT'S A TOWN ORDINANCE.
BUT TIME IS DIFFERENT HERE.
I MEAN, IF THE GUYS GET COOKING,
SOMETIMES GO FOR A YEAR OR MORE.
WELL...
WE GOT JOBS.
OH, YEAH.
MAYOR SAID MARY CAN GO WORK AT THE BEBOP BEAUTY SHOP.
I HAVE AN ENGLISH DEGREE.
A TEACHER'S CERTIFICATE, FOR GOD'S SAKE.
AND I'M A SOFTWARE EXPERT.
YOU DON'T HEAR ME COMPLAINING ABOUT IT, DO YOU?
I SAID TO THE MAYOR,
"YOUR HONOR, I'M A COMPUTER EXPERT,"
AND HE SAYS, "WELL, SON,
THERE'S NO COMPUTERS IN THIS HERE TOWN," HE SAYS,
"ALTHOUGH WE COULD USE
A COUPLE OF TICKETRON OUTLETS."
SO YOU KNOW,
I GUESS I'LL...
STACK SHELVES FOR A WHILE.
WASN'T TOO GOOD FOR DAD...
ONCE UPON A TIME, HMM?
HOW DO YOU REACH THESE PEOPLE?
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
I'M SUPPOSED TO SPEND THE NEXT GOD KNOWS HOW LONG
AS A SHAMPOO GIRL?
DON'T THEY HEAR YOU?
"I'LL BET YOU CAN WASH AND RINSE
WITH THE BEST OF 'EM, LITTLE LADY."
THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS TO ME.
HEY, YOU HADN'T OUGHT TO MAKE FUN.
MAKING FUN CAN GET YOU INTO TROUBLE AROUND HERE.
OK, CLARK, WE HAVE TO GO.
MY GOD, NOW.
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.
MARY--

nightmares.and.dreamscapes Season 01 Episode 04
Ok, so, um...
I, uh...
I got one chance to tell the-- to explain what happened and if I'm right,
I've got about an hour to do it and I want to get it right, so... here goes.
Ahem.
My name is howard fornoy.
I was a documentary filmmaker.
I want to tell you about the end of war, the degeneration of mankind, and the death of my brother, robert fornoy, the messiah.
It's a-- it's an epic story, and it's deserving of hours, but, uh, if anyone's watching this, you'll have to settle for the cliff notes version.
What better way than this?
I guess putting last things first, let's start at the very beginning.
Um... this is us.
Uh, the fornoys of D.C. And new hampshire.
Our summer cabin was overlooking the lake that faces the white mountains.
It's a chain that dates back about 500 million years, which by anybody's definition would be a beginning.
Uh... ok, let's forget the very beginning.
Um, my dad, richard, was a history major who made full professor at hofstra by the time he was 30.
10 years later, he was one of 6 vice-administrators of the national archives in washington, D.C.
And in line for the top spot.
By day, dad kept his eye on the declaration of independence, the constitution, and the bill of rights, you might say he filed by day and rocked by night.
He was a helluva good guy, too.
Give it up, D.C.!
He had every record B.B. King ever cut, and he was known to play a pretty mean blues guitar himself.
as for mom, she graduated magna cum laude from brown.
Had a phi beta kappa key that she used to wear on this funky fedora.
She became a successful cpa in D.C.,
Met my dad one night at a springsteen concert and took in her shingle when she became pregnant with yours truly.
I came along in 1977.
By '80, she was doing taxes for some of my dad's associates.
By the time bobby was born in 1982, she was handling taxes, investment portfolios, and estate-planning for a dozen powerful men.
She called it "her little hobby."
Yeah, me,
I was no disappointment to a couple of people with mensa gold cards in their wallets.
I maintained as and bs throughout school, and, uh... thanks to dad, I had an affinity for film.
Like a duck to water, I was wired with the same creative dna.
The winner for best student film is...
howard fornoy for airborne!
I was a good boy with a bright mind who grew up in an atmosphere of love and confidence, a faithful boy who loved and respected his mom and dad.
Bobby.
Well... bobby was a whole other story.
Drugs!
More drugs!
Come on, honey.
You can do it.
Honey, you can do it, babe.
Just one more push!
This kid is so gonna pay!
Nobody, not even mensa types like our folks, ever expects a kid like bobby.
Not ever.
Can you say da-da?
Come on, bobby.
Come on, honey.
Say da-da.
He's only a year old, richard.
He'll talk when he's ready.
Can you say ma-ma?
Say ma-ma, honey.
Howie, leave your brother alone.
I mean it, howie.
Bow-wow.
Honey?
Honey, the boy is speaking.
Bow-wow.
He's saying your name, howie.
-My name is howie.
-Bow-wow.
Bow-wow.
Bow-wow it was, and bow-wow it was to be.
In spite of the nearly 5 years between us, we were inseparable.
He could be a royal pain, I could be a brat, but when push came to shove, we were the fabulous fornoy boys and there was nothing-- nothing that I wouldn't do for him.
Bow-wow, faster, bow-wow!
I remember the time we found one of those thousand-piece jigsaw puzzles up in the attic, except we had lost the top of the box it came in, and no one had a clue what it was of.
The forest through the trees, the trees through the forest.
He, uh...
he had that gift.
He read at two and began writing short essays at three.
Now, that was startling enough, but there was more.
If handwriting was no longer a factor, you would have thought you were reading the work of a bright, if extremely naive, fifth grader.
And then, he developed headaches.
Well, he would wake in the middle of the night screaming in terrible pain.
We were afraid he had some... physical problem.
-Hey, son, are you sure this is on?
-Yeah.
Dad, it's fine.
You don't have to talk so loud.
I can hear you just fine.
Go ahead, mom.
Yeah.
Well, we were sure it was a brain tumor.
Your son, mr.
And mrs.
Fornoy, is in a state of extreme frustration because his writing hand isn't working as well as his brain.
You mean it's stress.
You have a child that is trying to pass a mental kidney stone.
Now, I can prescribe something for his headaches, but he really needs a different kind of drug altogether.
And so, uh, we got him a, uh... a commodore 64... with wordstar for christmas.
Then the headaches stopped.
I only want to add that for the next 3 years he believed it was santa who left the word-cruncher under the tree.
Deadline.
Um...
I once read a really funny piece that was titled the essential gone with the wind and it went something like this--
"a war," laughed scarlet.
"Oh, fiddle-de-dee."
Boom!
Ashley went to war.
Atlanta burned.
Rhett walked in and walked out.
"Oh, fiddle-de-dee," said scarlett through her tears.
"I'll think about it tomorrow, for tomorrow is another day."
Ba-ba-bam.
The fornoy boys grow up.
Howard went to university, graduated cum laude, and settled down to a successful career as a free-lance documentary filmmaker.
New york.
He was a good son.
Called home twice a week.
Stepped out with a lot of women.
Married one.
Got divorced.
Married another one, got divorced again.
My folks as great role models notwithstanding, marriage was clearly not for me, but career-wise I was doing fine, so I went to hollywood, managed to get myself nominated for an oscar.
And the award for best documentary goes to howard fornoy The search for rosebud.
"Fiddle-de-dee," said howard.
This is the life for me.
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
When I was 12 and he was 7, he told me that he had invented an airplane.
-Bobby, I don't know.
-I do.
I want you to push me.
Push me hard.
There's no seat belt on that crazy thing!
I swear I never would have pushed him as hard as I did if I thought the damn thing would actually work.
I'll be all right!
-It's working!
-They say god protects drunks and fools and children.
They also say that the devil's in the details.
Bobby?
Bobby!
I did it.
I flew.
You did, and if you ever try it again, I'll kill you.
Ah!
What'd you do that for?
See, I'm crying, but I wonder if it's on a sentiment or just the onset?
I think it's the former.
I better hurry it along, though, just all the same.
The reason I'm telling you this story is because I think the extreme case best illustrates the norm that life with bobby was a constant mind-bender.
What I haven't told you is that 4 hours ago,
I killed my brother by shooting him up with his own discovery.
He called it the calmative.
But... a very serious mistake might have been a better name.
Ok.
We've got about 40 minutes left, depending on my blood type, which I think is "a," but I'm damned if I can ever remember, so I'll just get off the dime.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxx The early years!
One day when he was 9, he blanked out every radio and tv on our street and the surrounding 4 blocks with his own voice.
For two hours, roughly 3,000 people could receive only wbob, which happened to be my kid brother.
So, thank you, wendell of georgetown for calling with your question.
The reason my dad farts so much in church every sunday is the high sulfur content in the baked beans.
But he gets most of 'em off pretty quiet, or sometimes he holds the real bangers until it's time for the hymns.
He was the youngest student ever to take quantum physics and advanced algebra classes at georgetown university.
Gamma equals the square root of "y" subscript "r" minus "l"
over "l" minus "y" subscript "F."
He graduated high school at 10, but he never got a B.A. Or a B.S.,
Let alone an advanced degree.
He went througha physics period, then he was nutty for chemistry.
See, guys like bobby, they come along maybe once in a lifetime.
The da vincisand the newtons and the einsteins and the edisons, and they all had one thing in common-- they're like huge compasses swinging aimlessly for a long time, searching for some true north.
And then one day, they just hone in on it with fearful force.
Bobby was no different.
No, by the time he was 14, it was, uh-- it was archeology.
Then it was anthropology.
He was the only teenager ever invited on an expedition into the rainforests of burma.
But just as quickly as bobby would embrace these headline acts, he'd, uh, he'd move on, still looking for his true north.
-Ok, here we go.
-Excuse me, honey.
-Bravo.
-Yes, I was up all night.
When he came back from his latest adventure, he was cheerful but his little boy exuberance was gone.
He wanted to talk about the news, about how bad it was.
You know, the nightly greatest hits had left us all reeling as if we were watching a 10-car slam-up.
It depressed everybody, but it depressed the hell out of bobby.
It's the hair.
I told him he should have a little trim.
-The hair?
It looks good.
-Thank you.
It's always with the hair.
Why are people so damn mean?
Why are they so damn mean?
Are we supposed to answer that?
Somebody needs to.
Pretty soon, too, the way things are going.
They're going the way they always went.
And I guess they're doing it because people were built to be mean.
Yeah, if you want to lay blame, blame god.
-No offense, mom.
-None taken, dear.
That's cynical.
I don't believe that.
And don't try to tell me that it's because of economic pressure or conflict between the haves and have-nots because that doesn't explain everything either.
Original sin, then.
That works for me.
It's got a nice beat and you can dance to it.
A year later, here we were.
Right here.
Labor day had come and gone, as had the summer people.
We'd stayed an extra week because we just couldn't bear to go our separate ways.
Most of the stuff was packed up and the place had that sad... deserted look that it always got.
But it was a sweet, sweet morning.
And it was a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
I remember the light on the water was so perfect.
The tv was on...
and diane sawyer... it was katie couric.
That's ok, mom.
Go ahead.
The show was interrupted with a special report... and your mother said... dick!
Boys!
-You gotta come and see this.
-There's been a tremendous explosion.
We can see thick ash and smoke rising.
I'll tell you, but that second tower's not visible from here.
There was a shower of sparks and fire and now... it almost looks like a mushroom cloud explosion.
Large billowing smoke rising from the second tower.
This is the second of the two towers hit.
You can't see behind us...
Maybe you're right, big brother.
Maybe it is original sin.
But then what's the instrument?
Have you asked yourself that?
Instrument?
I'm not following you.
What do you mean?
-Maybe it is the water.
-Huh?
It's that old joke.
Maybe it's something in the water.
Or maybe something that isn'T.
In looking back, I think that was the day he finally found it.
-His, um...
-his true north.
That was the day.
All we could hope was that things would get better.
Of course as you know, they only got worse.
And the world continued on its merry way-- looking for a band-aid here, a band-aid there, a quick fix and fast-fast-fast relief and I think instant cure-all wasn't even remotely possible anymore.
As for bobby, he continued on to points unknown.
We'd get a postcard back for a birthday or an anniversary, and he always promised that he was coming home soon.
But I didn't see him until he showed up in my apartment4 years later.
-Bobby.
-Hey, bow-wow.
Come here, you jerk.
-Where the hell you been?
-Good.
I got a lot to tell you.
Yeah.
Well, I should think so.
It's certainly been a while.
What can I offer you?
-A beer?
-Sure.
What've you got there?
Bees and wasps.
Wasps and bees.
Ok.
What kind of crazy-ass thing are you up to now?
Do you see this?
What is it?
Water, white lightning?
Well, it's both actually, if you can believe that.
It came from an artisan well in la plata.
It's a little town in texas.
Now before I turned it into this concentrate, there were 5 gallons of it.
It's only water, but it's still the damndest popskull the human race has ever seen.
This is it,
The big one.
The cure for the worst disease to which we homo saps fall prey.
Cancer?
No.
Wars.
Barroom brawls.
Drive-by shootings.
Meanness.
This, big brother, this is going to change it all.
This is going to bring about an end to the whole mess.
I think you ought to get your hand out of there now, bobs.
Relax.
You ever see a bee sting a flower?
You don't look like a flower.
Hell, you think bees actually know what flowers look like?
No way, man.
They know I'm sweet because I excrete sucrose dioxin in my sweat, although I did eat a box of chocolate-covered cherries on the plane.
Jeez, bobby.
Some 400 bees had investigated him.
Only one had stung.
Make that two.
So... have you directed anything good lately?
Piece on nazi art theft for pbs this fall.
I could screen it for you if you like while you're here.
Oh, that'd be great.
Bobby, what the hell are you up to?
Hey, could you get this other one?
I keep telling myself if I'm so damn smart,
I should be ambidextrous, but my right hand still has the I.Q. Of like 6.
You see, bow-wow, bees are nature's kamikaze pilots.
They don't sting you unless they have to, because it kills them.
Remember that time in the cabin when you told me we'd go on killing each other because of original sin?
Ok.
if that's true, if--if there is a god who loves us enough to send us on a rocket sled to hell just because stupid eve took a bite out of a bad apple, then maybe the curse is this--
he made us like wasps, instead of bees.
Howie, what the hell are you doing?
Just hold still and I'll get it.
Ok.The two bees that stung me, they're dead because their stingers are barbed like fishhooks.
They slide in easy enough, but when they go to pull out, they disembowel themselves.
That's pleasant.
wasps,on the other hand, they have smooth stingers.
They can keep stinging you as long as they want.
Of course, on the third or fourth time they're out of poison, but they can keep on pumping you full of holes if they feel like it.
And usually they do.
That's the same reason we go on fighting.
On and on and on, bow-wow.
We got smooth stingers.
Now watch this.
So... what's with the folks?
They're good.
They miss the hell out of you.
You should try to see them while you're here.
I will.
Let's roll.
Hey, what are you doing?
Same old wuss.
See, the thing with bobby is, is that when you were with him for more than 5 minutes, he hypnotized you.
He was lucy holding the football, promising this time for sure, and I was charlie brown rushing down the field to kick it.
Don't kill 'em!
You might as well kill babies for all the harm they'll do you.
That's the whole point.
Get that out of here!
I'm gonna ask you to do something for me, bobby.
No!
I want you to trust me.
No!
Are you out of your mind?
!
Come on.
Come sit down over here.
Come on.
Come sit down.
Look, they're just dandy.
Their behavior isn't drugged, and yet they're not terminally pissed off, either.
Watch 'em, watch 'em.
Pretty cool, huh?
I think I knew even then that something was going to go terribly wrong.
These are amazing.
*********
*******
As you know, texas is,per capita, the most violent state in the union.
They just love to shoot each other down there.
It's like a state hobby.
Except for la plata?
they like their guns there, too.
They just use them on each other a hell of a lot less.
The thing is, when you feed enough statistical data in the computer about this little town, what you get back is a whopper of an anomaly.
It took us 6 months to come up with this program.
I call it a calmquake.
What am I looking at here?
The numbers represent the incidence of violent crimes in each particular circle.
Murder, rape, assault and battery,you name it.
The computer assigns a number by a formula that takes population density into account.
Now, this... it says zero.
So it does, bow-wow.
You see, the old joke was right.
It is something in the water after all.
And the water in la plata-- it's a doozy.
We weren't the first to test the water.
Most people there have wells, so the water's tested regularly.
But we were the first to test it submicroscopically.
And that turned into really weird stuff.
What kind of weird stuff?
breaks in the chains of atoms, subdynamic electrical fluctuations, and this unidentifiable protein.
And the protein was the interesting thing, because as far as we know, it only occurs one other place.
That's the human brain.
What we've come up with will greatly suppress human aggression.
It'll make people unable or unwilling to fight.
Bobby,
I love you, man.
But this-- this is the craziest thing that I've ever heard.
You want crazy?
Protestors continue to clash with... that's crazy.
They are talking...
Studies support--
Bombing raids will continue to target... second The fire,which is still raging... that's crazy 8 ways to beat the band.
Me?
I'm not crazy.
Ok.
Here we go. just arrived.
Throat dryness.
there's not so much so far, but I can't kill myself, so, uh... god, I got so much to tell.
Suppose it can all be done, ok?
And suppose it all goes completely according to plan.
You don't have the slightest idea what the long-term effects might be.
-Howie-- -d-don't even suggest that you do, bobby, because you don'T.
You remember thalidomide?
nifty little pill, caused birth defects all across the globe.
Or how about the aids vaccine that they found?
Stops the disease but all the test subjects turn into incurable epileptics who died within the first 18 months.
Howie, this is-- no, how do you know this isn't the same thing?
How do you know that this is not going to come back and bite you in the ass?
I don'T.
I don'T.
It's too late, man.
The way we're going now, there might not be a long-term.
The world needs heroic measures.
Maybe we can cure the whole mess.
Or maybe we're giving heroin to a patient with terminal cancer.
I don't know.
But either way, we stop what's happening now.
We put an end to the world's pain.
Help me, bow-wow.
Please.
Please help me.
Please.
look at the time.
depending on my blood type, which if I'm wrong is--
did I already tell you that?
Ok.
A week later I flew to la plata where I met up with bobby and duke rogers-- geology professor extraordinaire.
How are you?
You got a good flight?
Not bad at all.
Not bad at all.
Duke rogers, my brother howie.
Nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you.
A pleasure.Let me take that.
Watch this.
You're not going to believe it.
2 males, 30s.
Intoxicated.
Talk about a sociological bull moose.
Look at my car, man.
Anywheres else in the country, them boys would be in the police blotter with name tags on their big toes.
here's to you.
This is what we've been brewing, howie.
It's pacifist white lightning.
Now, the water in this part of texas is fierce, but we've been able to make this stuff I sprayed the wasps with 10 times more potent.
We've got near 6,000 gallons now.
By the end of the year, we'll have 14,000.
Come next june, 30,000.
but it's not enough.
We need more of it and we need it faster.
And we need to transport it.
Transport it where?
Why, to the volcano.
This is the island of gulandio.
It lies 120 miles due east of borneo.
The natives call the volcano that's on it mount grace.
It's pretty perfect,isn't it?
Like krakatoa, grace is going to explode.
When krakatoa erupted, debris from it literally encircled the globe.
Changes in climate lasted 5 years.
Nipa palm, which is grown only in africa and micronesia, suddenly showed up in south and north america.
Krakatoa seeded them there.
That's the way I want to seed la plata water all over the earth.
I want people to walk out on la plata water when it rains and it's going to rain a lot after mount grace goes bang.
I want them to drink the water that falls in their reservoir and bathe in it, wash their hair in it, soak their damn contact lenses in it.
And you're going to do this how?
We need to synthesize 50-70,000 gallons of the high test, then we airlift it over to mount grace, drop it in.
Of course, it's going to take money to do that.
A lot of money.
And that's where you come in, big brother.
You're sure this stuff is safe?
Of course, you wouldn't want to drink the concentrate.
That's a real brain-buster.But... the way we're going to disseminate it, it's perfectly safe.
No problemo.
And this little time bomb of yours, when exactly is it wired to go off?
By october next year, probably sooner.
How much money?
It cost millions.
Lots of millions.
But still, it was less than a blink in the eye of what we spent on defense any month that year.
I raised most of it myself.
Some by hook and some by crook.
I had made a lot of friends in high places.
Some in low places.
in short, I knew a lot of folks who thought that things weren't changing that much no matter who was in the white house.
We did it.
We distilled the water into high-test and airlifted it over to gulandio-- grace, fate, destiny, what have you.
man.
That blows.
What is that?
Hydrogen sulfide.
Talk about your ultimate fart, huh?
It's as if god himself busted through all the business-as-usual transmissions
"This is your last chance,jerkwads!"
You sure about this, bobby?
As sure as I can be.
I ended up running at the football while my laughing, wildly intelligent brother held it one last time.
That volcano we called grace blew just when it was supposed to.
Everything went sky-high, and for a while, everybody's attention turned away from whatever and toward the skies.
And then fiddle-de-dee,just like that, it happened pretty fast.
There were 3 years of indian summer.
3 years like eden.
I mean, everybody stood down.
The world got like the wasps in bobby's nest-- the ones that didn't stink--sting too much.
But, like they say, the devil's in the details.
Ok.
Listen,you know how we... mom?
-Hello, dear.
-You have 6 darts, 9 balloons on the board.
3 balloons have prizes.
Pop those 3 and you'll-- mom, I've been trying to reach you all day.
Where you been?
I've been so busy.
I wanted to get this done before the baby was born.
How was school today, dear?
It's about mom.
Dad and I just got back from the doctor.
Bobby... she's got alzheimer'S.
What do you mean,
This is our calmquake graph charting the acts of violence increasing as you left la plata.
Right.
Now this graph shows the incidence of something else.
Something else?
People are going to get very silly very young.
Alzheimer's?
In spades.
It's going to sweep the land.
You're sure?
There was no way to know that the potency, rather than level off gradually like we thought, would keep increasing exponentially.
How many?
Oh, everybody.
Everybody on la plata?
No.
Everybody.
Ain't that a cosmic kick-in-the-head.
my gears are starting to get a little sticky.
Should've hurried more.
Never mind.
It's too late to change things now.
Let's move on.
Moving on.
Zippity-doo.
Roll tape.
All our prognosticators suggest that this new virus will make the aids epidemic look like a mere blip on the radar.
There appears to be simply no... and I repeat no way to contain it.
After a brief flurry of optimism, the W.H.O.Has acknowledged it is having no... countering the disease which is... spreading around the globe at an al-alarming... rate.
As you know by now, it created worldwide panic.
Me and bobby were as careful as we could be for the next two years.
Drank only bottled water and wore big sleek-- slickers in the rain.
So, no war, but everybody got a little... silly.
Almost everybody on this big round world of ours.
It wasn't reversible, there was no immunity to it, no vaccine, nothing we could do.
Nada.
Zip.
Now, pop...
I need you to sign this so that I can take care of you guys.
Do you understand?
Are you from the government?
No, dad.
It's, it's howie.
I'm your son.
They're doing things in the basement.
Terrible things.
It's ok.
It's all right, dad.
It's ok.
everybody let's have some fun you only live but once and when you're dead, you're done so let the good times roll let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old get together...
My folks died raving and pissing in their pants, but I never stopped loving 'em.
concentrate, jerkwad.
Concentrate.
Bobby went on with his research at la plata but to no avail.
Then one morning he couldn't sleep, and he went into the laboratory early.
dude, no loafing on the job.
Don't stand out in the rain, fool.
Glad to see you.
Remember when you could see the high-intensity arc-sodiums from north conway?
Not anymore.
Just the white mountains out there now.
I need to ask you to do something for me.
I need a favor.
A big favor.
I'm not doing it, bobby.
I can't do it.
A wuss right until the end.
I'm a wuss.
I'm a candyass.All right?
I always was,
I always will be.
That's who I am.
It's no big whoop, kiddo.
Just one little push and a final ride.
Bobby, come on.
There's got to be another way.
Please.
Push me, bow-wow.
Push me hard.
I did it.
I killed him by shooting him up with a highly concentrated dose of his own discovery 4 hours ago
I'm sorry.
I made the world full of fools and dumbbells.
better fools and dumbbells than a big black cinder in space.
Forgive me.
Promise me.
Tellid, ba-wa.
Tell... story... what happened.
Swear.
I will.
This was all predicted.
Revelations said the end would come.
That god would strike the infidels and that judgment would be his.
And now the end has come.
And now I think I'm done.
What do you think?
Is anybody watching this?
Bobby, bobby.
Way to go, bow-wow!
My name is howie.
Faster, bow-wow!
Goodbye, goodbye.
Time to stop.
Goodbye, bobo.
Not your fault.
Hi, dad.
I forgive you, bobby.
It's not your fault.
I'll be all right!
I did it.
I flew!
And if you ever try it again,
I'll kill you!
What'd you do that for?
I love you.
Goodbye, bobo.
Time to stop.
Goodbye, bobo.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I forgive you.
It wasn't your fault.
I forgive you.It wasn't your fault.
I forgive you,
I forgive you.
I love you.
I forgive you.
I love you.

IF I'M DEAD, HOW CAN I FEEL...
YOU'RE LOOKIN' GOOD, HOWIE.
HOW COULD I HEAR THAT IDIOTIC MUSIC?
RUSTY!
Howard:
OHH.
TURN THAT OFF.
WHAT KIND OF A MESS HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO?
SO, MIKE, WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
GENTLEMAN FROM UP NORTH.
LOOKS LIKE A HEART ATTACK.
Howard:
HEART ATTACK?
MEDICAL RECORDS?
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT ME?
YEAH, FROM THE COLUMBIA-PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL
IN NEW YORK CITY.
NEXT OF KIN?
SISTER.
HOW DO THEY KNOW ABOUT MY SISTER?
WELL, I'LL, UH, CALL HER WHEN WE GET THE RESULTS.
Mike:
THAT'S DECENT OF YOU.
A LOT OF DOCS JUST SEND A LETTER.
YEAH.
WELL, WE...
CARE FOR THE DEAD...
Howard:
DEAD?
BUT WE SERVE THE LIVING
NO.
WAIT.
PLEASE.
DON'T LET ME BE DEAD.
I'M BREATHING, AREN'T I?
MY LUNGS AREN'T-- AREN'T CRYING FOR AIR,
SO I--I MUST BE OK, RIGHT?
EXPENSIVE HAIRCUT.
EXCEPT, IF YOU'RE DEAD, THEY--
THEY WOULDN'T BE...
EXCELLENT DENTISTRY.
OH, I SMELL CIGARETTES ON YOUR BREATH.
I-IF--IF I CAN SMELL, I-- I MUST BE BREATHING, RIGHT?
NOW, HOW MUCH WOULD A DUDE LIKE YOU BE WORTH?
DEAD LUNGS DON'T BREATHE.
DEAD LUNGS CAN SORT OF JUST TAKE IT EASY.
TELL ME, HOWIE.
IN HERE, WE'RE ALL BROTHERS.
WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M BREATHING, YOU CLOWN?
OH, HE'S ALIVE.
HE'S SEEN SOMETHING.
OH, GOD BLESS YOU, RUSTY.
HE'S ALIVE.
IT'S A MIRACLE.
I LOVE YOU, DR. ARLEN.
WILL YOU MARRY ME?
YOU STOP THAT NOW, OR I'LL HAVE YOU FIRED.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE.
I'M SICK OF THIS SOPHOMORE CLASS WIT.
HELP ME!
HELP ME!
PLEASE!
WELL, I DIDN'T DO IT.
IT WAS HOWIE.
BITE ME.
I AM A MORON.
JUST PUT A LID ON IT.
WHY IS SHE BEING SUCH A BITCH TO ME?
'CAUSE YOU ASKED FOR IT.
OH, DID I?
Howard:
OH, TRAPPED INSIDE YOUR OWN MIND,
AND NOBODY KNOWS.
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU HERE TODAY, PETER.
AH, A GOOD SURPRISE, I HOPE.
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WORKED SATURDAYS.
Howard:
SATURDAY.
LUCK OF THE DRAW, I GUESS.
TODAY IS SATURDAY.
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT?
THAT'S IT.
NOW I KNOW WHY I WASN'T AT THE CONVENTION.
I WAS PLAYING GOLF.
OH, YEAH.
NOW, DON'T YOU WORRY, HOWARD.
I'M ONLY UP BY ONE.
WORRY?
HEH HEH HEH HEH.
I'M HOWARD COTTRELL,
KNOWN TO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE GLADIATOR PITS
WE CALL THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE
AS HOWARD THE CONQUEROR.
I TRUST ANGELA IS HAVING FUN.
SHE LOVES IT HERE.
THANK YOU.
DO YOU MIND?
[THUNDER]
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
[THUNDER]
HEAT LIGHTNING.
I DIDN'T DIE ON THE GOLF COURSE, DID I?
THAT'S ALL, FOLKS.
GET OUTTA HERE.
I STILL GOT MY SHOT.
YOU GET ZAPPED BY LIGHTNING, PAL,
YOU'RE GOING HOME IN A ZIP-LOCK BAG
WITH A SIDE OF SOUTH CAROLINA BARBECUE SAUCE.
FEELING THREATENED, ED?
AFRAID YOUR MIGHTY ONE-STROKE LEAD
MIGHT SUDDENLY EVAPORATE?
[HACKING COUGH]
[THUNDER]
[BRUSH RUSTLES] I KNEW IT.
THE ONLY THREAT AROUND HERE IS YOUR BANANA BALL.
GO AHEAD, DOCTOR.
PLAY THROUGH.
WHY, THANK YOU, GENTLEMEN.
I'D HATE TO DROP DEAD WHEN I'M 2 UNDER PAR.
HA HA HA HA HEH.
AH HEH HEH.
WHOA.
EASY THERE.
DARN.
YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET'S GO GET IT.
IT'S A $5.00 BALL.
OH, PLEASE.
[THUNDER]
SIGN HERE, PLEASE.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
BEAR DOWN HARD.
IT'S 3 COPIES.
CAN WE SPEED UP THAT PHOTOGRAPHY?
TURN DOWN THE LIGHTS.
MY EYELIDS ARE LIKE BLINDS ON BROKEN ROLLERS.
IF I'M ALIVE, WHY DOESN'T SHE SEE MY PUPILS CONTRACT?
Rusty:
ROGER THAT.
I'M DYIN' FOR A SMOKE.
I KNOW WHY.
THEY DIDN'T CONTRACT.
I HIT A WIDE SHOT, AND...
HO!
HO!
HO!
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
THE BALL.
I WAS LOOKING FOR MY BALL.
IT'S GONE.
FORGET IT.
[FROGS CROAKING]
[CHUCKLES]
THERE YOU ARE, YOU LITTLE BUGGER.
WELL, DON'T MAKE IT AN OPERA.
JUST PICK UP THE BALL.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.
THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN MAKE THAT SHOT.
COME ON, ED.
JUST LET ME PLAY MY GAME.
WHO'S STOPPING YOU?
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS, ED?
WHAT'S MY PROBLEM?
I'LL TELL YOU.
YOU DON'T SEE THE LARGER PICTURE.
OH.
ARE WE BACK ON THE MONTERO DEAL AGAIN?
WE BLEW THAT DEAL, BECAUSE AS USUAL,
YOU WERE THINKING CHEAP.
OH HO HO!
I'M CHEAP?
HA HA HA!
FOR THE PRICE OF A BALL, YOU PUT OUR LIVES AT RISK.
YOU ARE SUCH A WIMP.
OH...
WIMP.
OH, GROW UP.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GO ON.
I'LL WALK BACK.
OW!
DAMN IT.
WHAT NOW, COMMANDER?
WELCOME TO THE VIETNAM OF MYRTLE BEACH.
YEAH.
WELL, TAKE NO PRISONERS.
AHH, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE EIGHTEENTH.
PLACE IS PROBABLY INFESTED WITH TICKS--
AAH!
HOWARD?
HOWARD.
HOWARD.
HEY!
HEY, STOP!
OVER HERE!
HEY!
DOCTOR!
QUICK!
OVER HERE!
THIS WAY!
DOCTOR, PLEASE, MY BUDDY'S HAD A HEART ATTACK.
HE--HE ISN'T MOVING.
I'M ON MY WAY.
THIS WAY.
YEAH.
[COUGHS]
WHOA.
WHOA.
WHOA.
GOT HIM?
WHAAH!
E-EASY, BOYS.
Ed:
THIS WAY.
AH.
YEAH.
AHH.
EHH.
BREATHE ON THAT, SONNY.
SMELL THAT $20 BILL.
IF I MADE IT A HUNDRED?
EH?
YEP.
HE'S DEAD.
WHAT?
[SIGHS]
HEART ATTACK.
I SEEN IT BEFORE.
YOU YANKEES COME DOWN HERE
AND CAN'T TAKE THE HUMIDITY.
NO.
NO, NO.
THIS IS A JOKE.
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY SOMEONE'S DEAD.
I JUST DID.
IS THAT THE WAY YOU CRACKERS DO IT IN THE BOONDOCKS?
EVER HEARD OF C.P.R.?
THIS IS HOWARD, OK?
THIS IS MY BUDDY HOWARD,
SO PLEASE, COULD SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE?
AHH.
NEW YORK, CHICAGO, OR PARIS, FRANCE,
DEAD IS DEAD, SONNY.
Howard:
EXCEPT WHEN THE DECEASED IS STILL BREATHING.
THE DECEASED IS A WELL-DEVELOPED,
WELL-NOURISHED CAUCASIAN MALE.
RIGOR MORTIS IS NOT DISCERNABLE.
NO SIGNS OF A MEDICAL INTERVENTION.
INCOMPETENT MORONS.
RUSTY...
OH, THIS MUST BE HELL.
WE'RE ALL OUT OF BODY DIAGRAMS.
YEAH.
AM I BEING PUNISHED...
WELL, GO GET SOME.
FOR EVERY BAD AND SELFISH THING I'VE EVER DONE?
I REFUSE.
I WON'T GO OUT THIS WAY,
HUMILIATED BY A BUNCH OF SMALL-TOWN LOSERS.
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT GUY?
CRAWLED OUT OF A PETRI DISH.
POOR RUSTY.
YOU'RE BREAKING MY HEART.
PATIENT WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD BY...
WHO WAS THE ATTENDING?
KAZALIAN?
IS HE STILL AROUND?
HE'S THE GUY THAT PERFORMED THE PHYSICAL ON NOAH
WHEN HE GROUNDED THE ARK ON MOUNT ARARAT.
HA!
LISTEN TO HER.
SHE'S LAUGHING
WHILE THEY'RE GETTING READY TO CUT ME,
LIKE--LIKE THE FIELD AUTOPSIES I SAW IN VIETNAM.
THE BLADES SNAP THROUGH THE STERNUM.
THE RIB CAGE POPS APART.
THEY--THEY PULL OFF YOUR FACE LIKE A KID'S HALLOWEEN MASK,
AND THEN YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A...
A PIECE OF HUMAN GARBAGE.
I'M BEING ALLOWED TO DO THIS?
IN DR. KATIE ARLEN'S AUTOPSY ROOM?
DESPITE MY REPUTATION, I DO KNOW HOW TO SHARE.
I AM FLATTERED.
DON'T BE.
YOU'RE HOLDING THEM UPSIDE DOWN.
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T HELP HIM.
I KNEW THAT.
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING
FROM LOOKING AT SLIDES UNDER A MICROSCOPE.
YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S, UM--
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE.
OH, IT'S TOUGH MAKING A CAREER CHANGE.
KEEPS LIFE INTERESTING.
SHUT UP AND PAY ATTENTION.
I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.
[HISSING]
HERE'S MY HYPOTHESIS--
I.H.S.S.,
IDIOPATHIC HYPERTROPHIC SUBAORTIC STENOSIS.
NO SYMPTOMS,
AND IT WOULDN'T SHOW UP ON PHYSICAL EXAM.
I.H.S.S.?
GOOD BET.
DOLLAR IN THE KITTY.
YOU'RE ON.
MY LEG.
LOOK AT MY LEFT LEG.
THAT'S THE TROUBLE, NOT MY HEART.
I WAS BITTEN BY A SNAKE.
WHY CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?
PLEASE, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU CAN'T CUT ME UP.
HELP ME.
DON'T YOU REALIZE, i can still feel
WHY DIDN'T IT HURT?
OH.
OH, I SEE.
IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.
BUT, GUYS-- GUYS, LOOK AT MY CHEST.
OH, YOU MUST--YOU MUST SEE IT RISE AND FALL,
NO MATTER HOW SHALLOW MY RESPIRATION.
YOU'RE THE DAMN EXPERTS!
OHH, THIS TABLE IS ICE-COLD.
CAN'T THEY SEE GOOSE BUMPS?
[THUMP] OW!
IT'S ALL WET FROM-- FROM THE JUNGLE.
OF COURSE NOT.
I DON'T DO LAUNDRY.
MY SKIN IS SMOOTH AS MARBLE.
WHERE IS THE LOVEABLE RUSTY WHEN YOU NEED HIM, HUH?
OUTSIDE TORTURING SMALL ANIMALS.
HEH HEH HEH.
WHAT FOR?
THE TORTURE CHAMBER'S RIGHT HERE.
WE HAVE A DARK BLUE POLO SHIRT,
SHORT SLEEVES, SIZE LARGE.
GRASS STAINS.
OTHERWISE UNREMARKABLE.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
WATCH IT.
OH, IF THEY SNIP ME THERE, I'LL GO INSANE.
BUT IT WON'T MATTER, BECAUSE THEY'LL KEEP ON CUTTING
LIKE IT'S ONE BIG JOKE.
BOXERS OR JOCKEYS?
IN KATIE ARLEN'S AUTOPSY ROOM,
WE DO NOT DISCUSS THE DECEASED'S UNDERWEAR,
EXCEPT IN CLINICAL TERMS.
P.A.:
DR. WILKES TO UROLOGY.
DR. WILKES TO UROLOGY.
JOCKEYS.
BOXERS.
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE GUY.
THE JOKE'S ON YOU, SUCKERS.
WAIT'LL I GET OUT OF HERE.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT ONE HELL OF A LAWSUIT.
I'LL SUE YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.
I'LL CRIPPLE YOU.
RED?
HEH HEH HEH HEH.
BUT IT'S NOT VALENTINE'S DAY.
JUST SAVING IT FOR YOU, ANGELA,
LIKE I SAVE ALL GOOD THINGS.
[GASPS] OH, HONEY.
OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SURPRISE.
FOR 3 AMAZING YEARS, MY DARLING.
SO, WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS?
IT'S WHATEVER WE WANT IT TO BE.
I DEFINITELY WANT IT.
UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES,
HAVING A WOMAN DO WHAT SHE'S DOING
WOULD MAKE ME EXTREMELY HAPPY.
YOU HOLD HIM UP.
NOW I KNOW WHAT DEAD IS.
MY WEINER IS LYING THERE LIKE A STUNNED MOLE.
NO WONDER HE HAD A HEART ATTACK.
I DIDN'T HAVE A HEART ATTACK.
I WAS BITTEN BY A SNAKE!
I'M IN GREAT SHAPE!
WHERE IS RUSTY?
ALL THIS...
YOU'RE BLIND, LADY, BLIND WITH LUST.
JUST MY LOUSY LUCK.
...PISS ME OFF.
AW, HE DOES IT BECAUSE HE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.
HEH.
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN DOING THE AUTOPSY,
OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO JUST OBSERVE?
NO.
HE'S A ROOKIE.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WHY AM I NOT IN COLUMBIA-PRESBYTERIAN
MEDICAL CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY, WHERE DOCTORS ARE DOCTORS?
YOU WANT ME TO DO THE AUTOPSY?
YEAH.
I THINK SO.
OK.
SURE.
YOU'LL ASSIST, RIGHT?
YOUR TRUSTY COPILOT.
I--I THINK IT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT TEACHING OPPORTUNITY.
YOU BET.
PLEASE, DON'T.
PLEASE DON'T.
I--I THINK YOU'LL WANT TO START WITH THE EXTERNAL EXAMINATION.
RIGHT.
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.
NERVES.
WAIT.
THERE IS A WAY.
A SNEEZE WILL SHOW THAT I'M ALIVE.
I CAN'T EVEN SNEEZE.
SCREWED AGAIN.
HEAD IS NORMOCEPHALIC,
COVERED BY MEDIUM-LENGTH,
SLIGHTLY GRAYING HAIR,
WITH MILD TEMPLE BALDING.
ALL THOSE HOURS AT THE GYM, AND WHAT DOES IT COME DOWN TO?
MILD TEMPLE BALDING.
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A TEACHING OPPORTUNITY.
A CLEAR SCLERA.
NO PETECHIAE ON SCLERA OR...
CONJUNCTIVAE.
SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?
NO EVIDENCE OF ASPHYXIA.
WHAT ABOUT HEART ATTACK?
STILL A POSSIBILITY.
GIVEN HIS AGE...
THINK, HOWARD.
USE YOUR BRAIN.
IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S WORKING.
HOW CAN YOU GET THEIR ATTENTION?
...AND MAKE THE PRESUMPTION THAT THE EXERTION
WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE OLD GUY.
OLD?
BALLS!
AND YOU WISH YOU HAD SOME.
AND I WILL BE VERY CURIOUS
TO OPEN HIS HEART AND HAVE A LOOK.
YEAH.
SO AM I.
WOULD I INSULT YOU IF YOU WERE DEAD?
CHEST UNREMARKABLE.
UH, ABDOMEN MILDLY OBESE.
GENITALIA ARE THOSE OF AN ADULT UNCIRCUMCISED MALE.
HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THESE?
UM, MULTIPLE IRREGULAR...
I FEEL EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING DOWN THERE,
SO CUT IT OUT.
I MEAN--I MEAN, DON'T-- DON'T CUT IT OUT.
JUST QUIT IT.
GET YOUR PRETTY NOSE OUT OF THERE.
...LOWER ABDOMEN, GROIN AREA.
OH, THAT'S POETRY.
SCARS FROM THE WAR.
I AM SEEING ALL KINDS OF SCRATCHES,
BUG BITES, CHIGGER BITES ON THE EXTREMITIES.
MULTIPLE ELONGATED SCRATCH-TYPE ABRASIONS
ON THE LOWER EXTREMITIES,
WITH ASSOCIATED MILD EDEMA.
Howard:
THAT'S IT.
IN THE VICINITY
OF THE LEFT CALF.
THAT'S IT.
GETTING CLOSER.
GOOD.
VERY GOOD.
NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.
UH, THERE ARE MOSQUITO BITES ON THE LEFT CALF
THAT LOOK INFECTED.
KEEP LOOKING.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, KEEP LOOKING.
MAY WANNA DO A BIOPSY ON THAT.
ALTHOUGH IF WE'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE HEART, WE WON'T NEED TO.
UNLESS, W-WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO JUST, UH, SLICE THEM OPEN NOW?
Howard:
NO!
NO, DON'T!
NO.
THEY'RE PRETTY CLEARLY MOSQUITO BITES.
THEY'RE NOT MOSQUITO BITES!
POSTMORTEM CHANGES ARE SURPRISINGLY MINIMAL.
GOOD COLOR.
NO CONTUSIONS.
NO LIVIDITY.
GUY ALMOST LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE ALIVE.
DOESN'T HE WISH.
YES.
RIGHT.
I AM.
I AM ALIVE.
YEAH.
OK, LET'S JUST FLIP THIS PANCAKE.
STOP.
YOU'RE MISSING IT.
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE!
EEP!
OHH!
OH, MY NOSE.
WHAT IF I SUFFOCATE LIKE THIS?
OK.
OK, THIS COULD BE GOOD.
BLEED.
PLEASE, BLEED.
ONLY, DON'T JUST BLEED, GUSH!
YES.
YES, LET MY FACE SMACK DOWN ONTO THE TABLE LIKE A 10-TEN WEIGHT,
AND THEN THEY'LL KNOW.
NO NECK INJURIES.
NO RIGOR.
PETER, YOU WIMP.
WHAT IS THAT?
SOME KIND OF CATTLE THERMOMETER?
OHH!
I...
TAKE IT BACK.
DEAR GOD.
AND THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY GO CRAZY WITH THE LUBRICANT.
YOU HAVE A GIFT, DR. JENNINGS.
OH, THINK OF SOMETHING, ANYTHING...
DR. ARLEN, WATCHING YOU PERFORM A ROKITANSKY DISSECTION...
THINK OF THE MOTHER OF ALL HOME RUNS.
WOULD BE AN EXPERIENCE.
IT WAS, UH, UH...
I DON'T TAKE EVERYTHING OUT AT ONCE.
BUCKY DENT...
I PREFER TO GO ORGAN BY ORGAN...
BUCKY DENT'S 3-RUN HOMER AGAINST THE, UH-- THE RED SOX, 1978.
UNH--OH, THE RELIEF.
THE YANKEES CLINCHED.
FOR A DEAD GUY, HE'S REMARKABLY ELEVATED.
[CHUCKLES] NO, NO, SERIOUSLY.
WELL, HERE'S YOUR DIAGRAMS.
HE'S STILL GOT HIS SHOES.
WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?
YOU GOT THAT?
HMM?
OH.
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIKE.
Howard:
WHAT THE HELL WILL THEY DO TO ME NOW?
Rusty:
DRUNKEN GUEST AT A HOTEL
OHH!
GOT HIMSELF STEAMED
LIKE A CHICKEN DUMPLING IN A SAUNA.
BODY'S IN THE MEAT WAGON.
IT'S ON THE WAY.
HOW DOES A CORPSE MAINTAIN A TEMPERATURE OF 94.9 DEGREES?
IT'S A CLUE, GENIUS.
PAY ATTENTION.
WELL, THEY PLUCKED HIM OFF A GOLF COURSE
ON A HOT SUMMER MORNING.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT DID HIM IN?
A VAMPIRE.
WELL, THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT
WITH YOUR DERANGED WORLDVIEW.
NO, 2 TINY HOLES RIGHT HERE.
OH, AN ANKLE-SUCKING VAMPIRE.
WELL, EXPLAIN THE FACT THERE ARE 2 TINY HOLES OF EQUAL SIZE.
RUSTY, ARE YOU THE ONLY SANE ONE HERE?
SOCK MADE IN TAIWAN, BUDDY.
IT WAS A SNAKE!
DID YOU BLEACH THESE TOOLS?
DR. ARLEN, I KNOW MY JOB.
AND HOW COME YOU'RE LETTIN' HIM DO IT?
S-N-A-K-E.
SNAKE.
P.A.:
DR. ARLEN TO RADIOLOGY.
DR. ARLEN TO RADIOLOGY, PLEASE.
CARRY ON.
NO.
DON'T GO.
DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE WITH DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE.
WELL, IT'S ALL ME.
WHAT'S ALL YOU?
THE FEMORAL STICK.
Howard:
STICK?
SECOND BLOOD SAMPLE TO CROSS-CHECK
THE TOX RESULTS IN THE HEART BLOOD.
I KNOW WHAT A FEMORAL STICK IS, RUSTY.
OH, BUT HAVE YOU EVER DONE IT, DR. HOTSHOT?
Howard:
NOT THAT KIND OF STICK.
YOU EVER STUCK IT TO A CORPSE?
NO.
R-RUSTY?
WANT A GOOD, CLEAN VERTICAL STAB,
ONE TIME ONLY...
NO.
RUSTY, WE'RE FRIENDS.
RIGHT IN THE VEIN.
RUSTY.
GAAH!
IT'S A GOOD THING THIS GUY'S FEELIN' NO PAIN.
WILL I STILL BE ALIVE
WHEN THEY CUT OUT MY HEART AND HOLD IT UP DRIPPING
BEFORE PLOPPING IT INTO THE WEIGHING PAN?
FASCINATING HOW THE TOOLS OF AUTOPSY
HAVEN'T CHANGED IN DECADES.
DON'T THEY SAY THE BRAIN REMAINS CONSCIOUS
AFTER THE HEART STOPS?
FOR HOW LONG?
WE HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY.
2 SECONDS?
YEAH, BUT BASICALLY IT'S STILL THE SAME.
5?
A WHOLE MINUTE?
WELCOME TO THE DR. KATIE ARLEN SHOW.
YOU ARE DERANGED.
THERE ARE LOTS OF SECRETS IN THE AUTOPSY ROOM.
DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO SHARE, RUSTY.
P.A.: ...2387.
DR. CURRY.
KNOW WHY KATIE LIKES IT HERE?
'CAUSE IT'S DOWN-AND-DIRTY.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT SIDE OF HER YET.
BUT SHE'S A BABE.
SHE'S YOUR BOSS.
AND HE'S A HUMAN BEING.
YOU SHOULD SHOW MORE RESPECT.
DESPITE YOUR BAD-BOY ACT, RUSTY,
YOU CAN'T REALLY TAKE IT, CAN YOU?
DO ME A FAVOR, DOC.
YOU'RE NOT IN A LAB ANYMORE.
SHOULD YOU FEEL A LITTLE FAINT
WHEN WE'RE PEELING OFF HIS FACE,
JUST PUT YOUR HEAD DOWN BETWEEN YOUR KNEES AND, UH, WHISTLE.
WHEN WE MAKE THAT INCISION FROM EAR TO EAR
AND PEEL OFF HIS FACE,
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL SEE UNDERNEATH?
YOURS.
ONE DAY, LYING ON THIS TABLE,
IT'LL BE YOU.
[WHIRS] TURN THAT OFF.
STOP FIGHTING LIKE SCHOOLCHILDREN AND LISTEN TO ME.
WELL, I NEED A HAIRCUT.
TURN THAT OFF!
GET THAT THING AWAY FROM ME!
IF HE DOESN'T SLICE MY NOSE OFF,
I'LL HAVE A CHANCE.
IT'S BABY'S FIRST AUTOPSY.
WHAT AM I THINKIN'?
YOU'RE CRUISIN', BRO.
OK.
I'M STILL BREATHING.
IF I CAN BREATHE, EVEN SLIGHTLY,
THEN I CAN MAKE A NOISE.
IF I CAN MAKE A NOISE, THEY'LL HEAR.
NNNNNNNNNNNN...
LET'S TURN ON THE FAN.
IT'S GETTING RIPE IN HERE.
[FAN WHIRRING]
OHH!
NO, I'LL TAKE THE SMELL ANY DAY!
WHAT DO WE GOT?
NOW WHAT?
GENITALIA...
WHY ARE THEY OBSESSED WITH MY PRIVATE PARTS?
ACCORDING TO HIS MEDICAL RECORDS,
IT'S DUE TO AN ANTIPERSONNEL DEVICE
DURING HIS TOUR OF VIETNAM.
POOR GUY MUST'VE STEPPED ON A LAND MINE.
THAT SHRAPNEL'S CONSISTENT
WITH THE OLD SCARRING WE FOUND ON THE EXTERNAL EXAMINATION.
IT'S GONNA BE A CHALLENGE.
HOW SO?
WELL, WE GOTTA GET OUT ALL THOSE PIECES
AND VERIFY THAT THEY ARE SHRAPNEL FROM A WAR
AND NOT SOME NEW INJURY WHICH MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CAUSE OF DEATH.
Howard:
THEY'RE GONNA CUT OUT EVERY SINGLE SCRAP OF SHRAPNEL?
RUSTY, GET A ME A LONG PICK...
OH, DON'T DO IT.
DON'T DO IT, AND I'LL...
I'M ON MY BREAK.
I'LL ESTABLISH A SCHOLARSHIP, A--THE, UH...
WORKS IN AN AUTOPSY ROOM AND SMOKES HIS CIGARETTES.
THE DR. KATIE ARLEN AWARD FOR HUMANE TREATMENT.
YOU LIKE IT?
PLEASE, LEAVE ME SOME DIGNITY.
NOT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR, WAS IT?
STOP FEELING SORRY FOR YOURSELF.
I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU.
I TOLD YOU, I'M FINE.
[SIGHS]
IF IT WASN'T FOR LYNDON JOHNSON'S
DIRTY LITTLE ASIAN ADVENTURE,
WE WOULDN'T KEEP HAVING THIS CONVERSATION.
YOU ARE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF YOUR PARTS, MY DEAR.
YEAH.
ONLY, CERTAIN PARTS HAVE A HIGHER MARKET VALUE.
LET'S WATCH THE MOVIE.
MMM.
YOU EXPECT A 4-STAR ROMANCE.
YOU GET PREVIEWS OF COMING ATTRACTIONS.
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME, HOWARD, AND I'M STILL HERE.
[SIGHS] I'M CONTINUALLY AMAZED.
WHY?
I LOVE YOU.
AND I LOVE YOU.
I GUESS DEEP DOWN, I'M JUST AFRAID
THAT ONE DAY, YOU'RE GONNA RUN OFF
WITH SOME 250-POUND WEIGHT-LIFTING
FOOTBALL PLAYER STUD WHO'S HUNG LIKE A HORSE
AND HAS IMPREGNATED THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WITH HIS MANLY SEED
THAT TRAVELS AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT.
YOU ARE EVERYTHING I NEED.
OR HAVEN'T I MADE THAT PERFECTLY CLEAR?
SPELL IT OUT FOR ME.
IT CAN'T BE.
IT JUST CAN'T BE.
STRANGELY ENOUGH, NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE
ANY IDEA WHERE THE GOLF CLUBS WENT.
THEY COULD STILL BE IN THE AMBULANCE
OR IN THE CORONER'S
OR ALREADY CHECKED IN TO THE SYSTEM.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
WHAT THE HELL SYSTEM IS THAT, ANYWAY?
NO, THIS IS COLLEEN AT THAT EXTENSION.
I'VE SEEN NO CHARTS.
[DING]
HOWARD BOUGHT THOSE CLUBS IN SCOTLAND.
I WAS WITH HIM.
WE PLAYED 7 COURSES IN 5 DAYS.
I'LL TELL YOU THIS, ANGELA.
WE ARE NOT LEAVING THIS PISS-POOR EXCUSE FOR A HOSPITAL
UNTIL WE FIND THEM.
WHO CARES ABOUT THE GOLF CLUBS?
ANGELA.
ANGELA.
ANGELA.
Man:
HELLO.
Woman:
HOPE HE IS DONE.
I'LL NEED YOU TO GO BACK FOR SOME...
[DING]
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHO WAS HOWARD COTTRELL?
HOW DID THAT MICROSECOND IN VIETNAM CHANGE HIS LIFE?
THAT'S NOT OUR BUSINESS HERE.
YEAH, BUT LOOK AT HIM.
GOOD-LOOKING, SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN
DIES A THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME ON A GOLF COURSE.
ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS WHAT CAUSED HIM TO DIE,
NOT OUR PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY.
INTERESTING HOW A BODY SPEAKS TO US ABOUT A LIFE LIVED.
Howard:
DAMN RIGHT, JUNIOR,
AND IT'S A LIFE WORTH SAVING.
ALMOST LOST IT ONCE,
BUT HOWARD THE CONQUEROR CAME BACK,
HALF THE MAN, BUT TWICE THE FORTITUDE,
AND I'M NOT GIVING UP WITHOUT A FIGHT.
[PRESSING BUTTON REPEATEDLY]
TAKE IT EASY.
ANGELA.
YOU SEE THIS RING?
WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?
THE LAST THING I SAID TO HIM WAS, "OH, GROW UP."
WE CAN'T BRING HIM BACK.
I NEVER GOT TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
WELL, YOU CAN SAY GOOD-BYE.
HEY, DOC.
AT THE FUNERAL.
WE'LL HAVE THE BIGGEST FUNERAL THE STOCK EXCHANGE HAS SEEN
SINCE THE DOT-COM DISASTER.
P.A.:
MRS. PATAKI, COME TO NURSING STATION 3 WEST.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
THAT'S WHERE HOWARD IS RIGHT NOW.
HE'S IN THE MORGUE.
WE CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.
COME ON.
LET'S SIT DOWN.
COME ON.
[SIREN]
IS THAT THAT GUY'S STUFF THAT JUST ROLLED IN?
HOWARD COTTRELL, YEAH.
FIFTY-FIFTY?
IT'S THE DECEASED'S PERSONAL PROPERTY, DUDE.
WELL, HOW MUCH YOU THINK A SET OF CLUBS LIKE THAT IS WORTH?
NOTHING TO YOU.
THOSE CLUBS ARE NO GOOD TO HOWIE.
HIS THINGS BELONG IN THE VAULT,
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY GO.
WHY THESE HACKERS NEED A BIG TOUR BAG IS BEYOND ME.
CHIP SHOT.
5 BUCKS SAYS I CAN GET THAT CAN ON TOP OF THE GURNEY.
OH!
STOP FOOLIN' AROUND.
[HISSING]
SNAKE!
SNAKE!
AAAH!
UHH!
[ALARM BELL RINGING]
HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP!
THIS MAD CHARADE IS COMING TO AN END.
I'LL NEVER SEE ANGELA AGAIN,
ALL BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE CAN'T SEE WITH THEIR EYES.
TO MAKE THE INITIAL "Y" INCISION,
WE'LL EXTEND FROM THE FRONT OF THE SHOULDERS
TO THE XIPHOID PROCESS...
SHE'S GIVING HIM AN ANATOMY LESSON NOW.
AT THIS LATE STAGE, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
DO IT.
MAKE IT MERCIFUL AND QUICK.
DR. ARLEN.
YES?
CAN I CALL YOU KATIE?
PLEASE.
KATIE, I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE MY HYPOTHESIS.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WE HAVE A BODY WITHOUT A MARK ON IT,
AND WE KNOW THE DECEASED WAS PLAYING GOLF,
AND, WELL, A METAL CLUB ACTS AS A...
AS AN ANTENNA FOR ELECTRICITY.
HE COULD HAVE BEEN...
Both:
STRUCK BY LIGHTING.
I'D RATHER GO UP IN A FLASH
THAN LIE HERE LIKE THIS.
HOW LONG CAN I STARE INTO THE WHITE LIGHT OF MY OWN DEATH?
VERY OFTEN, THERE'S A...
HOW MUCH MORE CAN I TAKE?
YES.
NO.
STOP.
GO.
BRANCHING DISCOLORATION ON THE CHEST...
I'M FREEZING, INVISIBLE.
TO THEM, I'M JUST A USED-UP BODY.
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN ANYONE WHO SUCCUMBED.
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE?
YES, I CAN.
SURROUNDED BY SO-CALLED EXPERTS...
GO AHEAD.
BUT TOTALLY ALONE.
GO AHEAD?
[CLUNK]
GO AHEAD WITH THE, UH-- WITH THE INCISION.
[ALARM RINGING]
SOMEBODY HELP!
[HISSING]
Man:
SECURITY.
WE'RE HERE.
WELL, WHAT IN THE HELL TOOK YOU SO LONG?
!
IS ANYBODY HURT?
MY BUDDY'S DEAD, BEEN BIT BY A SNAKE.
IT'S STILL IN HERE.
HANG ON.
WE'RE WORKING ON THE DOOR.
HURRY UP!
GET THAT KNIFE AWAY FROM ME, YOU WIMP!
YOU'RE NOT FIT TO END MY LIFE.
I WANT A PRO.
AH, YOU KNOW, UM...
I SEEM TO BE HAVING A PROBLEM.
MAY I HELP YOU?
WHEN YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF AUTOPSIES,
YOU TEND TO JUST GO ZIP, ZIP, ZIP.
BUT WHEN YOU'VE NEVER DONE ONE,
YOU TEND TO GO...
EEK, EEK, EEK.
NO, NO, NO.
DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THAT HOWARD HAD HEART PROBLEMS?
[SIREN]
NO.
HE WAS HEALTHY AS A HORSE,
KEPT IN SHAPE, ATE RIGHT.
WE WERE IN LOVE.
YOU WERE THE JOY OF HIS LIFE.
AT LEAST HE HAD THAT FOR A WHILE.
I WANNA SEE HIM.
PUT THAT OUT OF YOUR MIND.
HE'S ALL ALONE.
WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT HOWARD IS AT PEACE.
Security:
HEY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Rusty:
SOMEBODY HELP!
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HELP!
DOING THE BEST WE CAN.
YOU KNOW, I SEEM TO BE HAVING A BIT OF A PROBLEM, TOO.
SPARED, BUT FOR HOW LONG?
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE YOU'VE--
YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS ROTATION, I-- I DON'T KNOW.
EVERY TIME WE'RE ALONE IN THIS ROOM TOGETHER,
I--I CAN BARELY CONCENTRATE.
I...
[SIGHS]
LUCKILY YOU CAN'T MAKE MISTAKES WITH DEAD PEOPLE.
OTHERWISE...
OH, YOU WACKY JOKESTER.
WHAT A STITCH.
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I...
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
HEH.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD ADVICE, DON'T YOU THINK?
"THIS PLACE IS WHERE DEATH
REJOICES IN TEACHING THOSE WHO LIVE."
[SIGHS]
PETER, WE...
WE CAN'T.
WE CAN'T.
I MEAN...
MAYBE IT WOULD BE GOOD--
WELL, ASTONISHING FOR A WHILE,
BUT WE GOTTA WORK TOGETHER, AND, UH...
YOU KNOW, WE JUST--
JUST...
WHAT IF...
WE ENJOY IT?
LOVE IN BLOOM.
HOW COULD IT GET ANY WORSE?
TRY SOMETHING WEIRD WITH ME, I'LL GO PUBLIC.
WHO SAYS THE DEAD CAN'T SPEAK?
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
[RING]
[HISSING]
GUHH!
[SQUEALS]
NO MORE!
NO MORE!
WHAT'S GOIN' ON IN THERE, FELLA?
WE GOT IT?
NEARLY DO.
HELP!
WE GOTTA SPEED IT UP.
THAT GENTLEMAN WHO GOT STEAMED IN THE SAUNA'S
ON HIS WAY, AND WE'RE BEHIND SCHEDULE.
Howard:
I CAN FEEL A CHANGE IN THE AIR.
OH.
I'LL TRY AGAIN.
THEY'RE SERIOUS NOW.
SURE.
GO AHEAD.
IT'S COMING, THE END OF HOWARD COTTRELL.
IT WON'T HURT FOR LONG.
MY BODY WILL GO INTO SHOCK.
YOU MISSED THIS-- MISSED THIS WOUND.
I'LL LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.
SOME BLAST WOUND.
I WON'T EVEN KNOW THAT I'M DEAD, WILL I?
HMM.
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.
WHAT HAS MY LIFE BEEN ABOUT?
IN THE GREAT PASSAGE OF TIME,
I'VE MADE NO DIFFERENCE.
PLEASE, FORGIVE ME, ANYONE I'VE HURT.
WHEN I'M GONE, REMEMBER ME WITH COMPASSION.
I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER.
I'M READY FOR THE SOUL'S LAST VOYAGE INTO SILENCE.
TESTES MUST HAVE SWOLLEN DAMN NEAR TO THE SIZE OF GRAPEFRUITS.
EXCEPT--OHH.
HMM.
LUCKY HE DIDN'T LOSE 'EM.
OH.
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.
GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE...
OH, WHAT A FEELING.
OUT OF HELL AND STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN.
SNAKE BIT HIM.
EXCUSE ME.
OH, HE WENT DOWN LIKE-- LIKE A TON OF CEMENT.
NO PULSE, NO HEARTBEAT.
HE'S GONE.
THIS MAN ISN'T DEAD.
HE'S NOT DEAD?
NOPE.
HE'LL MAKE IT JUST FINE.
WELL, MY GOSH, THAT'S AMAZINGLY GREAT.
EXCUSE ME.
HEY.
HERE YOU GO.
HEY!
ARE YOU OK OR--
ANGELA.
ANGELA.
LEAVE ME ALONE!
EXCUSE ME!
WAIT!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
CIVILIANS.
CAN I HELP YOU?
I'M LOOKING FOR MY FIANC?
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE DISTRAUGHT.
IS YOUR FIANCÉ|
A DOCTOR?
NO.
HE'S DEAD.
HER HAND IS STILL ON ME.
UH-OH.
OH.
SOMETHING'S REALLY HAPPENING.
BUT MAYBE I'M WRONG.
I MUST BE WRONG,
OR--OR HE WOULD SEE IT, OR...
THIS COULD BE THE RESULT OF SURGERY.
OR SHE WOULD FEEL IT.
OH, MY.
[DOOR BANGS]
MIKE WAS BITTEN BY A SNAKE.
RUSTY, YES!
YES!
THERE WAS A SNAKE IN THIS GUY'S GOLF BAG.
SING IT, RUSTY!
TELL IT LIKE IT IS!
IS THAT HIM?
HOWARD?
!
YES, MA'AM.
ANGELA, CALM DOWN.
NO, MA'AM.
HOWARD!
MY HOWARD!
Howard:
IT'S ANGELA!
WHAT IS THAT?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S A MIRACLE.
ANGELA!
NO.
WAIT.
DON'T CUT INTO HIM.
LOOK AT HIS SOCKS.
SOCKS?
LISTEN TO MY MAN RUSTY.
HE'S TELLIN' THE TRUTH.
HOWARD!
ANGELA!
LET HER IN!
HOWARD!
HOWARD!
Nurse:
I KNOW YOU'RE DISTRAUGHT.
THERE ARE 2 LITTLE DEFECTS IN THE UPPER MARGIN.
THOSE AREN'T DEFECTS.
THEY'RE FANG MARKS.
SHOW 'EM, RUSTY!
2 HOLES.
IF THEY CAN'T SEE IT NOW, I'M DOOMED.
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S BLOOD AROUND THEM.
Rusty:
HE WAS BITTEN BY A SNAKE.
THROUGH THE SOCK.
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIS LEG.
Howard:
SNAKE BITE.
SNAKE BITE 101!
WE DIDN'T SEE IT BECAUSE OF THE SWELLING
CAUSED BY THE SCRATCHES, BUT THERE THEY ARE.
Howard:
OH.
DR. ARLEN... 2 TINY PUNCTURE WOUNDS...
DON'T STOP NOW.
MIKE WAS BIT BY A SNAKE, TOO...
ONE--ONE LAST CHANCE...
HE WASN'T BREATHING.
TO PROVE THAT I AM AND REMAIN FULLY OPERATIONAL!
OH, MY.
OH, ANGELA.
OH, ANGELA.
THAT'S A SEMI.
A SEMI?
HOWARD THE CONQUEROR RISES FROM THE DAMNED.
DID YOU EVER DOUBT IT, EVEN FOR A SECOND?
IT ISN'T.
I MEAN, IT CAN'T BE.
I'M BACK!
HE'S DEAD.
BOY, AM I BACK!
DANG, DR. ARLEN.
YOU'RE...
STROKIN' HIM BACK TO LIFE.
AAH!
DR. ARLEN, YOU HOTTIE.
THAT'S NOT A SEMI.
THAT'S NOT IN THE LITERATURE.
IT'S--JUST CAN'T BE POSSIBLE.
I MEAN, HE WOULDN'T HAVE THE...
NEUROLOGICAL COMPETENCE.
UNLESS...
OH, THANK GOD.
THANK GOD.
I'LL BE A BETTER PERSON.
ANGELA, MY LOVE, I'LL NEVER LEAVE YOU.
YOU ARE THE BEST DOCTORS IN THE WORLD.
I'LL BUILD YOU A NEW WING.
I TOLD YA.
I'LL BUILD YOU A BRAND-NEW HOSPITAL!
A CHAIN OF HOSPITALS ACROSS AMERICA!
Dr. Arlen:
CODE BLUE IN THE AUTOPSY ROOM.
CODE BLUE.
GOT IT?
I GOT IT.
GET THE DOOR, PLEASE.
USE THIS.
WE GOT IT.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
SOMEONE DIE IN THERE?
WHERE'S THE PATIENT?
HIM.
HIM?
ALL RIGHT.
[VELCRO RIPS]
OK, I GOT THE LEADS.
WELL, THE REST OF HIM LOOKS DEAD, RIGHT?
CRASH CART PREPARED.
YOU COULD'VE FOOLED ME.
Howard:
THANK YOU.
A REAL DOCTOR,
A DOCTOR WHO WON'T KILL A DEAD PATIENT.
YEP.
THERE'S A HEARTBEAT.
BARELY, BUT IT'S THERE.
I AM GOOD.
WE JUST SAW AN ORDERLY IN THE SAME SITUATION.
HE WAS BITTEN BY SOME KIND OF A VIPER THEY FOUND IN THE ELEVATOR.
OXYGEN.
I MEAN, WE SURE GOT WATER MOCCASINS, RATTLESNAKES AROUND HERE.
NOBODY'S EVER SEEN A SNAKE LIKE THAT BEFORE.
HANG ON.
HOLD ON.
NO, NO, NO.
HE'S STARTIN' TO COME OUT OF IT.
TAKE IT EASY.
NOT TOO FAST, BUDDY.
HOW DID WE MISS THIS?
I ALMOST CUT INTO A LIVING PERSON.
ALMOST DOESN'T COUNT.
[GASP]
HEY, HEY, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
LIE DOWN.
OHH.
[TRAY, INSTRUMENTS CLATTER]
TAKE IT EASY.
EASY NOW.
[HEART MONITOR BEEPING NORMALLY]
[HOWARD GASPING] EASY.
THEY SAID YOU WERE DEAD,
BUT YOU CAME BACK AGAINST ALL ODDS.
HOWARD, MY CONQUERING HERO,
OH, HONEY.
OH, HONEY.
Nightmares.and.Dreamscapes.Stephen.King Season 1 Episode 03
Well,I can see I-
- Hold still.
Hold still
Bang,bang,Mr. Umney.You better skedaddle
I got a big,bad gun,and it's smokin'
Aw,don't shoot.I'll do anything.
Oh,just you wait,Mr. Umney.
Ooh.
Oh.
Slippery.Ah. I like 'em slippery.Ha ha ha ha
You're nothin' but a high-class gigolo.
Low-class,baby.
Oh,gosh,you're fun.
You think so?
Mrs. Sternwood.Uh,have a drink?
Clyde,you stinker
Mr. Sternwood was the stinker,remember?
And I got you out of it clean and square
Oh,Clyde,I thought we had something special
We gave it a go
Right.
Well,no more daydreaming
I know you don't love me
You've made it more than obvious
So I am going to end my life
What is that?
Drain cleaner
Somehow,I don't think so.
You know,Mrs. Sternwood,I don't believe I've ever really seen you the way I'm seeing you now
What do you see?
You're lovely,cunning
You are,Mrs. Sternwood,the last eternal mystery scorching,beautiful built for love not the kind of woman who would ever clean her own drains
Aah!
Oh,my God!
Sugar crystals.Just as I suspected.
Oh,my God
-Clyde Umney,private investigator
-I'm a fool
And you're awfully sweet
Trouble at Blondie'S.
I've gotta go
But--but,Mr. Umney,I--wait,wait,wait
Get some coffee for her sugar,will you,Doll?
Worries,Mr. Umney?
Not my style
What have you got here,Vernon?
W-why,that's Jesus walking'on the sea of Galilee and my wife dressed up like sweetheart of the rodeo
Nice fringes.
Vernon,you've invented something here
We are standing in the world's first moving-up-and-down picture gallery
Why,it's art for the modern age-- efficient,cost-effective look out!
He's got a gun!
Oh,my gosh!
He's got a gun!
You're a tough old bird,aren't ya?
No worries,Mr. Umney
That's it.
I'm leaving
-Where do you think you're going?
-Don't.
I have to turn you in
What's your problem,Ardis?
You got popcorn for brains?
I saw what you did,Dunninger.I couldn't help it
I was on that street corner waiting for the bus when you pulled up and shot 3 innocent people
Ah,don't go soft.
They were double-dealing dope addicts
I can't just forget it
You can if you're smart
If you turn yourself in to the police, they'll go easy on you
That's right.They'll fry me nice and slow
When my little sister was lost drowning in sin,I just waited, thinking God will protect her that she'd come to her senses, and it'd be all right
You know what,Mr. Dunninger?
God is out to lunch
Go the police,and they'll be scraping your little sister's face off the pavement and shoveling it in one of Blondie's homemade mincemeat pies
Let her go,Dunninger.
Bow-wow.
The talented Mr. Umney
Clyde,look out!
Stay here.
Behind the bar!
Oh,my!
Clyde?
Clyde?
You ok,Doll?
I am now.
Come home with me.
I can't.
Mother's waiting.
Run away to Mexico with me, just you,me,and the road.
It's not like that,Clyde.
You know it never is.
It's different for us.
We're one and the same.
We belong together,and someday I'll prove that to you.
-Stan!
-Yeah,Clyde?
Do me a favor,will ya?
See that Miss McGill gets home.
You betcha.
Stay out of the rain,kid.
Shut up,Buster.Get a job.
Swell.
Go on.
One more time.
Whoo hoo hoo!
There.
Ooh!
Ha ha ha!
George.
-That's my job.
-Wait,wait.
Now.
Go!
Ok.
One more.
Boys,this is one perfect day.
Somebody should slap a little "r" inside a circle symbol right smack in the middle of this day, a registered Los Angeles morning, a Louis B. Mayer production.
What do you say,George and Gloria?
!
Something okey-pokey?
!
Feeling an eensy-weensy hangover?
Look!
Buster,a cat!
Hey,what's the beef?
Why don't you yap when I need you to,you ignorant mutt?
-Vern.
-Mr.
Umney.
What happened to Jesus walking' on the sea of Galilee?
Where's the sweetheart of the rodeo?
What is this?
Remember,the party is on Friday.
Wait a damn minute.
What party?
What's going on?
Retirement.
To hell you say.
Mr. Landry's coming.
Mr. Sam Landry,owner of this building.
If you don't wanna come,fine.
You've been acting crazy as a loon for the past 6 months anyhow.
What's gotten into you?
You know what.It's the big "C."
Terminal cancer?
Since yesterday?
I'm retiring to Arizona.
Gonna live with my sister for as long as I have.
Let's face it,I don't expect to wear out my welcome.
You're supposed to be here, right here sittin' on your stool with Jesus and your wife over your head,not--not this.
For how long,Mr. Umney?
Since you know everything, you could probably tell me.
How long do I have to keep driving this damn car?
Well... forever.
Forever,Vernon
You can't retire.
No?
The way it looks to me, I really ain't got a choice.
This isn't right.
You know it isn't right,Vern.
What's not right,Mr. Umney?
Bye,Mr. Umney.
Get me the file on the mavis weld case, will you,Doll?
Dear Clyde,I have had all the groping and sneering I'm going to take from you.
Life is too short to be pawed by a washed-up divorce detective with bad breath.
You did have your good points,Clyde, but they are getting drowned out by the bad ones.
Do yourself a favor and grow up.
Yours truly,Arlene Cain.
P.S. I'm going back to my mother's in Idaho.
Do not try to get in touch with me.
She liked it.
She said she liked it.
Bad day,Clyde?
Samuel D. Landry at your service
Sam Landry?
You're the... you're the one that owns the building.
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry,Clyde,
I really am,but,uh... meeting you has been,well... not what I expected.
For one thing,
I like you a lot more than I thought I would.
But I've got business here, and there's no going back.
Yeah?
You're--you're not like any businessman I've ever seen.
You call that a briefcase?
It's a computer,a typewriter with a brain.
Ah.
Ha ha.
Ok.
I'm gettin' it now.
You carry a brain around in your briefcase.
You wear shoes that look like Boris Karloff's Frankenstein get-up, what are you,some sort of a horror-movie guy?
No.
Clyde,I'm a literary guy.
What's the writing on your shoes?
-Reebok.
-Reebok?
Sounds like a dish on a Chinese carryout menu.
Oh,you like that,huh?
I know all your ideas,Clyde.
After all,I'm you.
Yeah.
I noticed the resemblance.
Not familiar with the cologne,though.
It's called Aramis.
It won't be invented for another 40 years or so,just like my sneakers.
The devil you say.
Uh,the devil might come into it.
Where are you from?
I come from the future,Clyde,..
just like a... a pulp-magazine story.
Yeah,you come from sunnyland sanitarium,more like it.
But not like a science-fiction story,not exactly.
What was your father's name,Clyde?
What has that got to do with the price of cucumbers on Monday?
You don't know,do you?
What about your mother's?
Here's a couple of easy ones across the plate.
Where'd you go to school?
What was the name of the first girl you ever went all the way with?
Ok,stop playin' games.
Where'd you grow up?
Carmel?
Dusty Bottom,New Mexico?
Cut the crap.
Do you know?
Do you?
Yeah.
It was,um...
"San Diego!
Born and raised."
San Diego.That feels right.
It feels right because I wrote it.
What's a Sony?
Some sort of a side dish you get with a Reebok dinner?
Heh.
It's a Japanese electronics company.
Oh,now you're kiddin' me,mister.
The Japs can't even make a windup toy.
Not now.Tell me,Clyde,when is now?
Do you know the date?
1938.
W-wait a minute.
Uh,1939.
Don't feel badly.You don't know, because I don't know.
I've always kept the timeline vague in my novels.
Going more for a feeling.
Call it Chandler American time.
Works for my readers.
Ok,tell me what's going on here.
You're beginning to know,aren't you?
Maybe I don't know my dad's name or my mom's name or the first girl I went to bed with because... you don't know.
Is that it?
You're getting warm.
You don't just own this building.
You own everything.
Hot,hot,hot.
Hot as a hot potato.
You see the picture on the wall to the left of the door?
Don't do it.
"On the wall to the left of the door,"a reveredleader hangs,but always slightly askew.
That's my way of keeping him in perspective."
You're a writer.
You made me up.
When?
Or is that even the right question?
You first appeared in a mystery called Requiem for A Lady in 19...77.
You've grown a lot more complex and interesting since then.
You were pretty one-dimensional at the beginning.
What a pisser for me.
Your latest was called How Like A Fallen Angel.
I started that in 1995.
Took me 5 years to finish.
My life's been interesting,Clyde.
Yeah?
Well,you screwed up big-time with this one.
I didn't want to scare you any more than I had to.
Yeah?
Well,you're scaring me plenty,mister.
If you created me and you can turn George Washington into
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then you can do anything.
Buster.
Here,boy.
George?
Gloria?
It's me,Clyde,from next door.
Here's to you,George and Gloria.
No more parties.
No more trips to palm desert.
No more basie and ellington blowing' through the open window in spring.
No more of that Welsh corgi bark that goes through your head like slivers of glass.
You did this.
You made George kill his wife, you stinkin' bastard!
You're a clever boy,Clyde, but readers love nasty murders, because secretly they wanna be the killer, shoot the annoying neighbor.
Strangle that whining girlfriend.
Make-believe is a great healer.
Yeah?
Well,it didn't heal the demmicks.
They were good people.
You think you're God,but you're just a 2-bit bully.
Why,I've beaten wiseguys tougher than you in your own books.
"His revelations hit me like some kind "of debilitating drug.
"All the strength went out of my muscles.
"My legs felt like"a couple of strands of al dente spaghetti.
"All I could do was flop back in my chair and look at him."
That's not very good,but rapid composition has never been one of my strong points.
You son of a bitch.
Yeah.
I suppose I am.
You know your client,mavis weld?
She was a character in a novel called the little sister by raymond chandler.
-Ring a bell?
-No.
No.
Of course not.
In your world,chandler never even existed.
But he's the man for every mystery scribe since then.
Clyde umney was the name of the lawyer in playback.
I did it as an... um,a tribute,an hommage.
Hommage?
Sounds like a fancy word for stealing,if you ask me.
So what'd you come here for?
What's the heist?
I came for you,clyde.
For me?
Sorry.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to think of your life in a new way from now on,clyde, as a,um... well,as a pair of shoes.
You're stepping out,and I'm stepping in.
Oh.
How fascinating.
And,uh,what happens to clyde umney?
I want you to see something.
This is my personal diary.
Don't even think about it.
This is stuff I didn't make up.
This is my life, the interesting part.
Why did you come for me?
There.
It's-- it's about a cemetery.
Linda and I went to see our son's grave every week.
I'm sorry for you,landry.
I can't come here anymore.
Why?
Are you behind on writing the book?
- How can you say that?
- Because the book is all you do.
Yes,I write in order to stay relatively sane.
But coming here is like ripping out stitches over and over.
I'm not gonna leave danny.
Nobody's leaving him.
It's just so cold in the ground, and he's all alone.
How long do we go on blaming ourselves?
Just give me a minute,will you,hon?
Mom!
Dad!
Look at me!
They're gonna win.
Don't you dare.
You owe me!
Danny.
Danny!
Danny's at the bottom of the pool!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam!
Danny's at the bottom of the pool!
Somebody help!
Danny!
Danny,no!
Get him out!
Get him out!
Where are you?
Uh,page 187.
No.
Not what freakin' page you're on.
Where are you?
How are you?
- 'Cause you're not here with me.
- I'm working.
You're escaping,off in your own private universe.
Oh,god.
You know what?
That's great for you,sam.
Why don't you just live in your fictional world, because that way,you never have to face the fact that we've lost our son.
I'm aware of the facts.
God.
You know what?
Maybe I'm as nutty as you,but sometimes-- sometimes I wish clyde umney were here.
He's definitely younger.
Remember when he saved ardis mcgill from going crazy when she lost her little sister to a life of prostitution and--and how he consoled mrs.
Norris in how like a fallen angel?
He gave her hope.
He brought her back to life.
He screwed her brains out.
You just sit there staring at that screen.
Linda didn't know it, but she gave me the idea to come here.
She's given me a lot of good ideas.
Not only do you steal from that guy ray chandler, you steal from your own wife.
I've heard of low,but that's bargain basement.
Are you getting this news flash?
Writers are the most shameless, self-centered bastards in the world.
We lie,we seduce,we'll steal your soul-- anything to look good on the page.
Aw,you won't get any tea and sympathy from me.
I'm a bestselling author, and I don't have the words to console my own wife.
You're my alter ego.
You can do what I can't do.
- Go to linda.
Help her.
- You are nuts!
Like the way you saved mrs.
Sternwood from swallowing drain cleaner.
If that'd been me, I would've had a panic attack,but you were great.
I'll stay right here in my own shoes,thanks.
As you say in your world,I am the man.
What the hell does that mean?
We're all men.
Here.
Take a powder.
I got work to do.
Don't get snotty.
I made you.
Oops.
Did we make daddy mad?
Is that how you talked to your little boy?
Damn you.
Ah,what are you gonna do, turn me into a barking dog?
"Dunninger's boys knew they couldn't touch me "without bringing down the heat,
"so they took it out on my girl.
Well,not her,exactly,but her little sister."
Don't do this,landry.
"And when ardis found the poor kid,
"she looked like she'd been attacked "by a circus of crazed monkeys with samurai swords."
Stop it,you stinkin' pervert!
"And they carved her face into monkey meat."
They killed her,clyde,my poor little sister.
- I know.
- Why did she have to suffer so?
- Ardis,get the hell out of here.
- I told you it would never be good.
This world of ours is a heartless maze of greed and hate,and there's no way out.
You're wrong.
The world is bright because you're in it.
Why do bullies always win?
"She was already over the edge.
"And there was nothing I could do to stop her."
They don't always win.
You know why?
Because there's love.
"She had taken things into her own hands."
I hear you,my darling.
Ardis,listen.
N--aah!
I wish you all the love in the world.
You didn't have to do that.
It's a new chapter,pal.
You think you're pretty slick,mr.
God almighty, but you're a bush-league version of god.
I'm not your puppet.
You can't control me.
"My will ebbing,I pushed on."
- You're dust...
- "this was it."
- And your stories are dust.
- "Final adversary..."
- it's the characters that live on.
- "The last gun battle..."
- nobody'll remember your clever little tricks.
- "That was coming at me like a bullet to the gut."
- But they'll remember clyde umney.
- "The big sleep."
Aw,that's right.
Make everything stop so you can do anything you want.
Clyde umney would never do that.
He'd call it the coward's way out.
Let me live.
This is my life.
Too late.
It's my name on the windows.
I have always wanted to be a private eye, ever since I was a little kid, to live in a world I could understand... where sweet little boys don't drown, husbands and wives don't stop loving each other.
That place is here-- my place,my time,los angeles,1938-- and that private eye is me.
Is this the end of clyde umney?
I don't exactly know what's coming.
Close your eyes.
I'll try to make this quick.
I hope it doesn't hurt,old buddy.
But you could care less if it does, you arrogant prick.
"And so I left town."
"And as to where I finished up,"well,mister,
I think that's my business.
Don't you?"
"The end."
sam...
I'm clyde umney.
Gosh,sam,what did you do?
You grow a mustache while I'm mopping the floor?
I'm clyde umney,mrs.
Landry,from 1938.
This is a little early for halloween,honey.
Can I come in?
The pool is cold.
What do you expect?
Nobody's used it in months.
I guess nobody would.
Not since your son drowned.
Danny.
He was 6 years old.
Sam told me all about it,and I'm sorry.
It was a tragic accident,ma'am, and you don't need to be shouldering' the blame.
When did you talk to sam?
When he came into my office and stole my damn life.
So... this is the house imagination built.
- Sam was big on imagination.
- Yeah,I can imagine him.
In cement shoes at the bottom of a lake.
Sam talked about this.
He called it the big rewrite.
He was gonna write you out of your world and write himself back in.
I just thought it was another one of his daydreams.
But... wait.
You're... you're as real as can be.
We swapped lives.
That's what must've happened.
What did it feel like?
There was a--a lot of bright,green light, and then...
I guess I came in through the machine, like a keyhole between 2 worlds.
But it feels all right.
Huh.
That thing is...
black-magic voodoo.
On a good day.
Does this mean that sam is gone?
He's probably got his heels up on my damn desk right now, fleecing my clients and chasing my girl.
Only,she's dead.
He probably brought her back to life, the selfish bastard.
- Do you want a drink?
- You oughta know.
Oh.
Hold the phone.
You're a lot more fun in person.
In the novels,you're very grim.
Murder is grim,mrs.
Landry.
What the hell are we supposed to do now?
Well... you're a hard-boiled detective, and I'm a dame.
We could always find some lonely, gullible type and shoot him for the insurance.
Irony.
You didn't have that in your world.
You mean talkin' uppity in order to sound smart?
Yeah...
We had it.
Sam landry,private investigator.
Sam landry,private investigator.
Sam landry here.
Ring.
Landry here.
Doll,I told ya,don't call me at work.
This is gonna be all right.
- Ah.
That's swell of you,mrs.
Landry.
- Well,I want you to feel at home.
Say,uh...
You know how to work that machine?
Not if you keep calling me mrs.
Landry.
Couldn't be any harder than flying' an airplane.
Like you did in wings of deceit.
You know,that was not sam's best.
He had some success, and then he got fat and lazy.
Are you gettin' this news flash,mrs.
Landry?
Your husband cared for you.He didn't want you to suffer anymore because of the kid kicking' off.
That's why I'm here.That's why everything's loused up,and somehow I gotta get back.
But you can't, because that's not the way sam wrote it.
Well,screw him.
Sam was right,though.
Being with you is having a very positive effect.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Well,I call it hell.
Frozen dinners you cook in a box.
Sneakers that look like frankenstein shoes.
Music that sounds like crows being steamed alive in a pressure cooker.
There's a lot to recommend in this world.
The sushi.
Caller I.D.
300-thread-count egyptian cotton sheets available by catalog.
Wait a minute.
Bite me,clyde.
I'm just a tramp.
I know who are.
You're cora papadakis.
The hellcat from requiem for a lady.
You know,sam stole that name from a man called james M. Cain.
He was a greedy little thief.
- You're no good.
- Oh,god.
- You're a bum.
- Oh,just relax,will you?
We're a married couple.If you and my husband are the same person,then technically,we must be married.
Ardis mcgill was always supposed to be my one true love.
But wait.
We don't have to play by his rules,clyde.
We can write our own story.
Oh,let's just drive to mexico,baby, just you,me,and the road.
Let's make a baby.
I know it's gonna look... just... like you.
When did you open shop,detective landry?
A few chapters ago.
I see.
So... what up?
Heh heh.
you suspect your wife of fooling around?
Hi,mr.
Landry.
Candy?
No,thanks.
I'm here to clean your pool.
Oh.
So that's what they're callin' it these days.
Ah heh.
Yeah.
So,you look good.
How's the writing going?
Peachy.
I'm home,honey!
Bang bang!
Yeah,you better run.
I got a big,bad gun,and you're gonna get it.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
I'll do anything.
Danny's at the bottom of the pool!
Danny's at the bottom of... sam!
Sam!
No!
Mom!
I'll do anything.
Get out!
You...
Leave my boy alone!
- You...
lousy,two-faced...
- all right,calm down.Calm down.
Washed-up divorce detective with bad breath.
Calm down.Calm down,mrs.
Landry.
I just want sam and danny.
Get ahold of yourself,mrs.
Landry.
I thought we could start over.
I thought we could have a baby and it would look just like...
No.
I bought clothes.
I was gonna surprise you with a second honeymoon.
Or first.
Or whichever.
But... you're with her.
It's never gonna change,mrs.
Landry.
This is who I am.
This is how it's written.
No.
No.
Because sam changed the ending.
Sam thought he was god,but he forgot one thing.
Character is destiny.
Clyde umney's never gonna change.
If it makes you feel any better, I don't wanna be here either in this groaning world of yours with its freight of disease and senseless violence.
Just go.
Just go back to wherever it is you came from.
In a snap,mrs.
Landry.
Only,god didn't leave the directions.
- I know she is.
- How do you know?
- I saw them together.
- You saw them together.
So that's how you... put it together.
Yes.
In the toolshed.
What,may I ask... of course,you may ask.
You ask him.
What were they doing in the toolshed?
Is it necessary to go into such personal details?
That's why they say,"private," in private eye,mr.
Woolrich.
That'S...pretty good.
- Need a nurse in here.
- Right there.
His pupils are fixed and dilated.
- Ok.
Let's move him.
- Yes,doctor.
1,2,3.
We're losing him.
- No.
- Detective landry.
No...
- What on earth?
- No.
What have I done?
What didn't I do?
"Ardis mcgill was a really great gal.
"I mean,really great.
In the sense that you'd never met anyone like her before."
Take me back.
Through the looking glass...now.
Honey, that's really bad.
Ok,ok,it isn't perfect.
Ha.
It sucks.
- But who says you can't learn?
- God.
I guess it's a one-way thing.
You can't just type the words.
You gotta be a real writer.
Which is what?
A writer wakes up with his mouth full of pity.
Hemingway said that.
How did I know?
I didn'T.
It was sam.
Sam's the real writer.
I'm just me.
Forget it,baby.
No.
I'm gonna get better at this.
Did you read that,sam?
I'm comin' after you.
I found my way in.
I can see you, but I don't think you'll be able to see me, not until I wrap my hands around your neck.
Heh heh.
Until next time,pal. nightmares and Dreamscapes Season 01 Episode 03

richard kinnell.
I love your books.
I'm a fan.
Thanks.
No.
I'm a fanatic.
Mr. Kinnell,it's an honor.
I'm betsy wright from pen.
So nice to meet you.
Betsy.
This way,please.
Here,sir.
Here.
Thank you.
The hand of glory.
I made it myself.
Thank you.
Here you go.
Good.
I get at least 10 of those a year.
How was the drive,rich?
Dreadful,thanks.
I've been trying your cell phone all morning.
No service?
No phone.
You turned it off,you son of a bitch.
I'm wrestling with some ideas.
How do you think I feel when my one client won't take my call?
I apologize.
You still love me?
10% of the time.
Please make sure we connect after this panel.
Warner brothers wants to shoot "night vision."
They brought the brink's truck.
Mr. Kinnell, mr.
Kinnell, where do you get your ideas?
Mr. Kinnell, do you ever scare yourself?
-richard,
-So... richard!
You got to check this out,huh?
Cool,
Could you sign it for me?
How about a signature?
Come on.
Come on,buddy.
Let's go.
Come on,guys.
I'll return.I love you!
Let's go.
Put your shirt back on.
Was that me?
Yeah,if it is,you need a waxing.
sarah.
Richard.
Will, will.
will you two excuse me?
Are you comfy,richard?
No, but I'm wealthy.
My caboose has landed its own reality show.
Let me know if you find my dignity up there.
I have a problem,don't I?
atypical cells have appeared in your colon and spread to the lower intestine.
I want you back next week for an upper G.I.
What is it?
It's nothing yet.
Come on,josh.
You're withholding.
I am, but until we know more-- it's serious.
let's take another look at it.
Frigged by the fickle finger of fate.
Sorry?
I mean,I'm not surprised.
My mother died at 44 and my father at 36.
You're looking for a reason.
There are lots of reasons-- red meat, cigarettes, unprotected sex.
Look,the reason is the same for all of us, all right?
We are mortal.
I imagine,you know,writers, they enjoy a great measure of control over their work.
You control what your characters say.
You control what they do.
You even control the weather.
Medicine's different,richard.
We're accustomed to a significant degree of chaos.
Man plans and god laughs,huh?
At least let me have another look at this.
move it!
Come on,knuckleballs.
What are you,blind or blind and drunk?
Damn it.
Please,god,it better be nothing.
I'll die when I'm ready to die.
Physical fitness has never been so cheap.
You can do it... you're a smug one.
What do you know that I don't know?
Aren't you richard kinnell?
Yes,I am.
I should have known you'd go right for that.
It's so you.
It is,isn't it?
I'm judy diment.
I live down the street.
what can you tell me about this painting,judy?
It's original.
The artist was bobby hastings.
He's the reason I'm selling off all the hastings' things.
The house was theirs.
They even left a dog.
The subject looks like a rock and roll cannibal.
Bobby was like that.
He wore the same t-shirt day in and day out.
It had a picture of the led zeppelins on it.
By the end,bobby was just skin and bone, dirty all the time.
The end,what?
Suicide.
Bobby was just 23.
He was the tortured genius type,you know, but still living at home.
It was the drugs.
do you have any other paintings,judy?
No.
One fine tuesday, bobby took all his paintings and sketches out into that side yard, except for that one,
I guess,and burned them.
Bobby must have had 70 or 80 plus all his sketchbooks.
Iris-- that's bobby's mother-- said most of them are real bad, lots worse than the stuff that'd curl your hair.
Most of them have sex stuff in them.
Really?
In the garage, they found over a hundred of those little bottles they sell crack cocaine in.
This is where bobby used to paint.
Anyway,I guess he finally reached the end of his chain.
No pun intended.
Aren't drugs awful,mr.
Kinnell?
They certainly were.
When iris found him hanging right there... there was a tiny note pinned on his shirt.
It said,
"I can't stand what's happening to me."
Really?
Um,I feel the same way.
Ok,so how much do you want for the painting,judy?
$45.
Oh,quiet!
Who's gonna buy that dog?
He won't listen to me.
I'll be honest with you.
I started at 70, but nobody likes it, so now it's marked down.
Where in the world do you get all those crazy ideas?
Given the choice,I'd rather live.
So sorry.
I stopped at a yard sale on the way.
Did you find any treasures?
I always do.
Well,let's see.
Ok,ok.
This one's gonna blow your pantyhose off.
that's a charming thought.
richard, it's horrible.
I hate it.
Oh,come on.It's not that bad.
***********
Fitting,isn't it?
Who would paint such a thing?
I'm surprised you weren't more sensitive to it yourself.
You're the master of fear.
You always were an imaginative fella.
I didn't notice the tattoo.
It's those teeth.
No,no,no.
I saw those.
It looks different in this light.
The sky looks darker than I remember.
Anyway.
Thanks for lunch.
You liked it?
Delicious.
A penny for your thoughts.
I had a checkup today-- my very first colonoscopy.
And they found something.
I have to go in for more tests.
Have they done a biopsy?
Next week.
that's not so bad.
It's not so good.
You're thinking about my sister.
It's not like it was in her day.
What am I,50?
Mom was 40 when she got sick.
But she had 4 good years.
You know,that artist that hung himself, he left a simple note.
It said,
"I can't stand what's happening to me."
stop that talk.
It's self-pity.
Get busy living.
You've got 50 more books to write.
50?
I got to stop off at sally's on the way home.
She's watching hobo for me,you know?
You and sally gonna get together?
No.
We're just friendly.
maybe you could use a little more friendly in your life,?
no,thanks.
One time around the park with sally is enough for any man.
now,richard,
I know you're gonna be fine.
You just have to keep a good attitude.
That's most important.
And you can start by getting rid of that horrid picture.
Oh,auntie.
Oh,I'm serious.
When you get to the saco river,
I want you to pull off into that break-down lane and throw it over.
look at me,richard.
I'm 63.
My secret is simple.
Fill your life with flowers.
You hear that,"road virus"?
Aunt trudy wants you to go for a swim.
No,a sink.
I love you.
I love you.
A bushel and a peck.
Quiet, you crazy dog.
Sorry.
The sale's over.
Fill your life with flowers.
So much for flowers.
for god's sake.
Rosewood.
He's in rosewood?
It's impossible.
Hi.
No wonder that kid killed himself.
Nice legs.
Be sure you eat your fiber.
What painting?
I don't see any painting.
Jade!
Down.
Morstead,down!
Come here.
Come here.
Sorry, richard.
Rescue dogs are loyal but needy.Good girl.
Did he need to eat my wiper?
It's ok now.You can come out.
There.
Oh, sorry,richard.
Your dog's inside.
Hey, is he always so thirsty?
I can't keep him away from the toilet.
Maybe he's got a salt imbalance.
I'm just saying I'd look into it.
How was the writing conference?
Fine.
You feeling less threatened by your popularity?
Sally, um, thanks for watching hobo.
Can you bring him out?
You're not coming in?
-Quiet.
-No, it's late.It's late.I have what...
I got two more hours to get up to derry.
I understand.You probably have someone waiting.
No.
Nobody's waiting.
Oh, my god.What happened to our car?
I mean your car.Did someone break in?
It's a long story.
Were they trying to steal your painting?
I bet you stopped at a consignment shop.
You're always treasure-hunting.
But I destroyed it.
Oh, tell me you didn't buy that.
Or is it a gift from one of your sick fans?
Richard?
Are you ok?
I destroyed that.I threw it in the river.
God, you're not well.Look at you.You're all white.
-The stock market...
-hey, you look better.
You got some color back.
Richard, you're acting weird.
You're freaking out your own dog.
The yard sale was in rosewood, new hampshire.
What yard sale?
The yard sale where I bought the painting.
When I bought it this afternoon, the firebird was crossing the zakim bridge in boston.
Now it's in rosewood.
The painting is changing.
It's following me.
You're drinking again.
-No.No.
-The pills?
Then what is it?
Richard, you had a checkup after the writing conference.
I mean, what did your doctor say?
He found something.
What did he find?
He didn't say.
Why didn't you tell me this?
Were you expecting to drive home alone and keep this inside?
Now tell me exactly what the doctor said.
Whatever he said is the least of my worries.
Right now, there is the distinct and terrifying possibility that I might be losing my mind.
You're not losing your mind, richard.
You just had a terrible day.
I think you need a healing.
yes, a healing.
We've got to get you out of these clothes first.
Come on out back.
...Will be able to take advantage of valuable federal tax credits starting in 2006.
We interrupt now for a breaking local news story.
A rosewood woman has been brutally murdered while doing a favor for an absent friend.
38-year-old judith diment was conducting a yard sale outside her neighbor's home when she was savagely attacked.
Neighbors heard a loud car accelerating away from the vicinity along route 1.
Ok, so we have to adorn your chakras in crystal.
Do you think that crystals will tame a runaway imagination?
Yes, they will.
My god, it's hot in here.
Well, that's the point.
Your body is releasing toxins.
Ok, now take this.
It's a flower extract to combat fear.
-Open up.
Come on.
-I'll take a pint.
You have to educate yourself about health, richard.
You're a writer.
Do your research.
Knowledge is power,power to fight.
Fight.
Yeah.
That's what aunt trudy said.
Hey, welcome back.
You feel better?
Come on.
Get in.
It's gone.
Like magic.
What'd you do with it?
Don't ask.
Sally.
It's in the trash where it belongs.
Did it change?
I didn't look.
No.
I mean, was it still the yard sale?
I told you I wouldn't look, and neither should you.
Here.
What's this?
I--I want you to stay at the lighthouse inn tonight.
Richard.
No, please.
If you do,I'll be able to sleep.
I'm not afraid of your painting.
I know.Just humor me.
Thank you for the healing.
You're welcome.
and hobo thanks you, too.
Anytime, hobo.
Find your way back.
Maybe I will.
Maybe I'll beat this thing inside me and... just,surprise everyone.
Bye.
Bye.
Home, hobo.
Home.
No more yard sales.
I sent her away.
I know what you are.
You're a disease growing in my body.
If I die, you die.
I want you to think about that.
Killing me would be your suicide.
We need each other to live.
I'm not your damn disease,you egomaniac.
I'm what you don't know.
I'm your fear.
Rosewood police tell us that today's murder is not the first tragedy in this neighborhood.
Just last year, a boy next door committed suicide in this same house.
It's very sad, claudia.
Very sad for the diment family and all their friends.
-I'm claudia clemmens reporting from rosewood.
-It's real.
This is real.
No.
Aunt trudy'S.
-Hello.
-Trudy.
I know it encourages burglars to say things like this, but I've gone to kennebunk to watch a movie.
If you intend to break in, please don't take my china pigs.
If you want to leave a message,do so at the beep.
Trudy, call me when you get back home.
I don't care how late it is.Just call me.
Oh, god.
Please not aunt trudy.
Send them by the coast road.
Please send them down the coast road.
No.No!
No!
Trudy?
Yes, dear.
What is it?
Are you all right?
I'm better now.
What's wrong?
Your voice sounds all funny.
It's trembling.What is it?
It's that picture,isn't it?
-It's that damn picture.
-Well, yeah.You were right.
It--it's evil,so I burned it in the fireplace.
Well, good.Scatter the ashes, too.
You were worried about me, weren't you, because you showed it to me?
Yes.
Fire was the right idea.
That's how they used to kill evil, right?
You've used it a few times in your books.
Ha!
You're right.I did.
I'm fine, richard.
You get some sleep.
You've had a hard day, hmm?
You've got to stay strong and healthy.
We'll talk tomorrow?
I think so.
Good night, dear.
He would have been here by now, even if he'd taken the coast road.
Hobo.
Take it!
Take it!
It's yours!
Go away!
Leave me alone!
Damn you.Damn you.
Blood.
I'm going outside, I think.

Careful,mum.
It's bloody hot.
You were saying?
My... husband is... lost.
Missing.
Here in crouch end?
Oh,mr.
Freeman.
Mrs. Freeman.
Shall I call a porter to help you with those bags?
-No,thank you.
-Ok.
I do have a message for you,sir.
The caller did insist that I give it to you as soon as you returned.
Here.
Oh,why,thank you.
Thank you.
-Have a wonderful day.
-You,too.
Good-bye.
Oh.
Hello.
Pardon us.
What floor?
9.
But I'll do it.
Not a problem.
No!
Don't push... it.
My wife grew up on a dairy farm in wisconsin.
Elevators are still a mystery to her.
I'm superstitious about pushing the elevator button twice.
They say that it's bad luck.
Never hurts to be careful,does it,dearie?
I cannot believe i did that.
It was so embarrassing.
No.
No,it's fine.
I hear that the british love americans coming over here and scaring their old people into an early grave.
You did this.
All lawyers are romantic cripples,you know.
They're beautiful.
So are you.
Thank you.
My mother told me to marry anita fenburg.
Oh.
But I couldn't get my head around spending the rest of my life trapped with someone whose last name translates into "swamp city."
Well,look at you now,mr.
Free-man.
You got caught.
No.
I surrendered.
We keep doing this,we're never gonna get to the victoria and albert museum.
I'm devastated.
Please don'T.
It'll just be business.
Oh,you're right.It's the office.
Oh,I should get it.
Hello.
Hey.
Your ambition can wait.
Now,what you should take is me.
You big thief.
Weren't you supposed to give this to me?
I forgot all about that.
"Dear lonnie,now that you're finally here in london,
"you must come to the house for dinner tomorrow at 6:30 if that's convenient.
Regards,john squales."
Who's john squales?
He's our solicitor,lawyer,here in london.
We worked together on the betton steel merger.
He said that I was uncommonly bright.
He actually used the word "uncommonly"?
I may have added that last bit,but he did say that I was smart.
Rumor has it that he's the next head of the executive committee.
You ok about having dinner with him tomorrow?
It'd be tonight.
He sent that yesterday.
Oh,crap.
Oh. "Battery low."
I just charged you,you sucker.
What are you gonna tell him?
We're coming.
It's our honeymoon.
Can't we be alone?
Please,there's not a chance he's still expecting us.
Hey,john.
Lonnie freeman.
You're not gonna believe this.I just got your note.
Listen.
About dinner tonight.
You saved us a spot.
Great.
Sure.
Fire away.
Right.
Right.
A cab to crouch end.
No,no,no.It sounds really simple.I'll see you at 6:30.
Talk to you,too.
You're gonna love him.
Crouch end?
That's an ugly name.
You owe me.
-Big time.
-Yeah.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
I need the ladies room.
They call it the "loo" here.
It's over there.
Ok.
You know what i was thinking?
At the rate we're spending money, I'm gonna have to work until I'm 90?
No.
No.
I was thinking that if you thought we had time, maybe we could go back to the hotel and renew our wedding vows.
Which vows?
The ones that go"I do you,you do me till death do us part."
Oh,those vows.
I love those vows.
Excuse me.
What can I do for you,man?
My wife and I are trying to figure out how long it'll take us to get somewhere.
Where is it you wanna go?
Grand hotel.
This time a day,with traffic,30 minutes.
Ok.
And how long will it take us to get from the hotel to crouch end?
I'm sure I can't help.
It's a place for strangers not to go.
No.
I got a friend that lives on the outskirts.
Hear what I say,man.
Don't go to crouch end.
What happened?
I don't know.
I mentioned crouch end and he got all weird on me.
What did he say?
Something about strangers don't go there.
Between the jamaican accent and the reggae,I missed something.
What do you wanna do?
Besides that.
We still got time.It's only a little before 5:00.
I'll get a cab.
You relax.
We waited over 30 minutes for a cab.Isn't that a little odd?
A pinch unusual,sir.
Unusual?
I say it's close to unheard of,my friend.
Yes,sir.
Where to then?
Crouch end,please.
Crouch end you say.
Right.
Heigh-ho for crouch end.
Cut it out.
That feels too good.
I think that's the point.
Stop it.What about the driver?
I tip him well,he sees nothing.
Lonnie,anybody can see in.
Ok.
All right.
But remember if I happen to keel over in the middle of dinner-- don't say that.Take it back.
What?
You don't joke about something like dying.
Take it back.
Fine.
I take it back.
Good.
Pardon me,sir.Do you have an address?
Yeah.
Somewhere.
Lonnie,did you see that?
What?
It said "sixty lost in underground horror."
Isn't that what they call the subway here?
Yeah.
That or the tube.Was it a crash?
I don't know.
Sir,was there a subway crash here recently?
Collision,mum?
None that I know of.
Weird.
I don't know where I put it.Did I give it to you?
What?
The napkin I wrote the address on.
No.
What's bothering you?
That headline.
"Sixty lost in underground horror."
It's like sailors drowned at sea.
Ooh!
Gooseflesh.
My grandma always said that someone was walking over what's going to be your grave.
Honey,grandma's a whacko.
Don't be mean.
She may be a little eccentric,but she's sweet.
Think about it.
The woman will only plant her vegetable garden at midnight when the moon is full.
Sweet or not,she is not from our dimension.
She is a little weird,isn't she?
Pardon me,sir.
Did you say "dimension"?
Where you're going-- crouch end-- it's a place where there's a thin spot is what they say.
What the hell's a "thin spot"?
A thin spot between what we see as our world and the other.
"Other"?
What the gentleman said.
Dimensions.
The only thin thing around here is his grip on reality.
Perfect.Besides a low battery,I have no signal.
All right.
When we get to crouch end, I'll call again and get squales' address,tell him you lost it.
I lost it?
Yeah.
A good lawyer never accepts blame.
Then,baby,you're gonna be a great one.
Finally.
What is it?
Nothing.
Nothing,I guess.
Guv.
You're here.
Crouch end.
Sir.
It's archibald,mum,but everyone calls me archie.
Archie,is crouch end a nice place to live?
Well,they've tried,mum.They've tried to make it nice.
Had its own tube station once.
E h and I railway,they built bridges and roads and storage areas.
But then they... well,let's just say they moved on.
When was that?
Well,they stopped using it in the late 1930s.
Oh.
Why?
Well,they claim it was the second war,but that's not the real reason.
No,no,it wasn'T.
It was when they were making some repairs to the station platform and...well, the story I heard was they found a mass grave.
Well,london is laid out like no other city.
More like it hatched and meandered a street pattern than it planned one.
It's because the streets were paved over barriers.
Barriers between what is rational and what is not.
Crouch end was built on top of a towen.
A town?
No,mum.
A towen.
Towen.
It's a druid word.
Means a place of ritual sacrifice.
Said that crouch end rests on top of the druid towen of slaughter.
So is that what they found when they were building the subway station?
A druid burial ground?
No,no,mum.
The bodies they found were fresh,not centuries old.
You're making this up.
As the lord is my witness,I'm telling you what I know to be true.
It happened right here in slaughter towen.
You're just being silly.
Mum.
You asked me if crouch end's a nice place to live.
To you it looks nice and normal.
But it's not what it seems.
Now,what i told you before is true.
This world is like being inside a huge leather ball.
And outside the ball are other dimensions.
And there are scuffs,nicks in the leather that make the thin spots.
And every once in a while,the leather rips right through the thin part.
It's then the other dimension pours in and breathes and lusts... right here in crouch end.
You and your husband shouldn't be here.
Yeah,pot roast sounds fine.I like pot roast.
I don't see any reason we shouldn't be there by 6:30.
Yeah,I mean,I've got...
Ok.
Got squales' address.
Where's the cab?
I don't know.
Aw,man.
It's 10 after 6:00 already.
What did he do,just up and leave?
Did you pay him?
No.
There was still 12.50 on the meter.
Hey,kids!
Hel-lo.
Hey,I'm talking to you two.
You american,sir?
Yeah.
There was a cab over here.Did you see where it went?
Bugger off,joe!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
I guess some of the kids in crouch end aren't too crazy about americans.
Rude little brats.
Did you see that little boy's hand,though.
Poor thing.
Hon,looks like we hike.
I'm not sure I want to.
What if those kids went to get their big brothers?
Well,there isn't much else we can do.
The street's not exactly overflowing with taxis,is it?
That was so odd that he just left.
He seemed nice.
A little creepy,but nice.
-The cabbie was weird was what he was.
-Oh.
Dimensions.
Thin spots.
Honestly.
Did I say it was a left on petrie or a right?
Geez,lonnie,I don't remember.
Why don't you just call squales and have him meet us?
No.
Him thinking I can't follow simple directions will not help my career.
What is it with guys and directions that they can never ask?
What's that about?
First of all,I'd ask for directions if I was lost.
But I'm not.
I'm just trying to figure things out.
Secondly,I grew up in a city.
I'm hard-wired for direction.
What?
Anyone born and raised in a city has a built-in sort of guidance system which always leads them to promised land.
But,baby,you grew up in madison,wisconsin,not manhattan.
And that is hardly a city.
A city is a city,doris,and we're not lost.
Um,baby, would you just go into that police station and ask them directions to brass butt lane?
Please.
For me.
Ok.
And it's brass end,not brass butt.
-Ok.
-Wait here.
Hello.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Don't do that.You scared me.
Doris,relax.
There's no one here,ok?
You're making me jumpy.
Did you get directions?
Yeah.
I messed up on hillfield.
It was a right,not a left,on petrie.
No,we made a right on petrie.
No,I don't think so.
-Yeah,lonnie,we made -honey.
Let's not be late for dinner.
Nice area.
I love this style of architecture.
Yeah.
Reminds me of alaska.
Can't you just see the sled dogs frolicking in the snow, little ice balls clinging to their fur?
-What?
-Oh,you're back.
I missed you.
Lonnie,this isn't funny.
All that stuff from the cabbie,does it really bother you?
Yeah,it does.
Everything around here is creepy.
Creepy.
Yeah.
I see.
Doris,there's something that you should know.
In all fairness,it's something that i should have told you before we were married.
I'm not just a lawyer.
I have another job.
It's a really important one.
It's actually more like another life altogether.
In the vast world of darkness,I am better known as... lonnie,the creep slayer.
You are such a jerk.
Perhaps,but it was you who summoned me.
Now,where are these creeps who menace you?
I am walking next to the biggest one.
Ah.
Obviously the creeps' leader.
Formidable,evil,but undeniably handsome and uncommonly bright.
You are uncommonly something.
Yes.
I think he lives somewhere near here.
Did you hear that?
No.
Lonnie,don'T.
What do you mean don't?
Someone could be hurt.
Let's just see if they need help.
That's strange.
What is that?
Must have been a crash or something.
No.
Lonnie,please don'T.
-If someone's hurt,I should take a look.
-Remember what I read and what I saw?
About "sixty lost in underground horror"?
Maybe we were being warned about this.
That was about a subway.
No,it wasn'T.
-Archie said -archie?
Who the hell is archie?
The cabdriver.
What if that is a thin spot?
He said that they have them in crouch end.
An underground place where things rupture and cross over.
"Rupture and cross over"?
Oh,honey.
He just got your imagination going.
No,he didn'T.
I'll just be a minute.
Lonnie,please.
Please come back.
Ah,there's another trail.
This thing goes off around the side of the house.
Damn.
Whatever this stuff is,it's sticky.
There's another hole.
Be careful.
Yeah.
There's something down there.
Help!
Lonnie!
Lonnie,I'm coming!
Hold on!
Doris!
Lonnie!
Doris,help!
Lonnie.
Lonnie!
Doris,run.
Run.
Run!
Come on.
Stop,stop,stop,stop.
I can't keep up.
You have to stick with me,doris.
I am.
Where are we?
Crouch lane and norris road.
Wherever the hell that is.
Idiots can't even spell "town."
No.
That's a druid word.
I don't recognize anything.
Lost my jacket,too.That's a hell of a note.
No,you took it off.
-Lonnie,it was covered in goo.
-How is every body?
I didn't take it off.I lost it.
That's all.
Lonnie,what happened?
What was on the other side of the hedge?
Nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Lonnie,talk to me.
I don't remember.It's all a blank.
We were there.
We heard a sound.
And I was running.
That's all I remember.
Why would I throw my jacket away?
I liked that one.
After all,it did match my pants.
Ok,we have to get out of here.
No.
No,we're going to john squales' for dinner.
I promised.
Baby,we don't even know where he lives.
Why don't we just go back to the hotel and we can call him from there.
Break a promise?
I don't think so.
Fine.
Then call him.
Tell him to come and get us.
I don't remember his number.
It was 5-- it'll be in your cell phone.
Now,there's a good idea.
Oh!
I never did get this thing charged.
Got it.
He's got to be there.
He's saving a place for us.
John,thank god.
It's lonnie.
Yes.
That's just it,john.
I'm having a bit of trouble finding you.
John?
John?
Why would he put me on hold?
Is the phone dead?
Dead?
It's dead.
The phone's dead.
It can't be.
Where are you going?
John's place.
For dinner.
Forget john.
This is wrong.
Everything about this is wrong.
I just wanna get in a cab and go now.
How can we do that,doris?
How can we go back to the hotel when we are lost?
Or maybe... maybe it's more like we're trapped.
Crouch end was east... to the hotel.
So if we go west... we'll go back to the hotel.
That means that we have to go back... that means we have to go back the way we came.
No,it'll be all right.
Baby,we're gonna be all right.
Come on.
Come on.
Are you all right?
I'm a little tired is all.
Me,too.
We need to keep walking.
What do we tell them back at the hotel about what happened?
Don't say anything.
Well,honey,look at us.
They're going to ask.
You can't say anything about what happened.
It'd only make it worse.
Ok.
Promise me you won't tell what happened.
I promise.
I promise.
I won't go this way.
Lonnie,it's the shortest way back to the hotel.
No.
Lonnie.
I won't go this way!
We'll try this street.
We'll see if this takes us back.
Come on.
Let's try this way.
I was thinking-- and that's all i'm doing is thinking.
If the cabdriver was right about these rips in the thin spots which allows things to happen, then they'd have to go away,too.
They couldn't be permanent,or weird things would be happening all the time,right?
So maybe... they've come and gone.
Maybe everything's normal now.
Where are all the people,doris?
The clock tower.
I saw that.
In the cab on the way in.
Lonnie?
We have to go.
You promised.
Lonnie,let me go.
Lonnie,let me go!
Stop it.
What are you doing?
We have to stay together like we promised.
It's the only way.
Why did you slap me?
God,I'm so sorry,doris.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I'm scared,lonnie.
Me,too.
Did you hear that?
The cars?
We must be near traffic.
Let's go.
Lonnie,did you see that?
Did you see the cab right up ahead?
Lonnie.
Lonnie,come back!
Lonnie,please, come back!
Lonnie!
Lonnie!
Lonnie,come back!
I know the way out of here!
Please,I wanna go!
No,doris.
It's this way.
I've seen the other side.
You're wrong.
It's the other way.
You promised not to leave me.
You promised me.
You said you loved me.
Doris.
Give us a cigarette,love.
Lonnie!
Lonnie,answer me!
Voice:
Cthulu kryon.
Yogsoggoth.
R'yeleh.
Nrtesn nyarlahotep.
Lonnie!
It's the american woman.
She's lost.
Lost her husband.
Lost her way.
Found the darker way.
The road that leads into the funnel.
Lost her hope.
Found the whistler from the stars.
Eater of dimensions.
The blind piper.
Where's my husband?
He's gone beneath.
Gone to the goat with a thousand young.
What have you done with him?
He couldn't well not go,could he?
The mark was on him.
You'll go,too.
Dor-is!
You made it,baby.
You kept your promise.
Now we'll stay together...forever.
What in the name--can you help me?
I need the police.
What happened then,lovey?
You look like you've been put through a wringer,you do.
Car accident?
The street opened up.
They took my husband.
It's happened again.
The station's down there.
There's globes hanging in the front.
We don't want you near us,not if you've been to slaughter towen.
Careful,mum.
It's bloody hot.
You were saying?
My husband is...
lost.
He's missing.
Here in crouch end?
Yes.
Happened today?
Why do you keep asking me the same questions?
I've already told you what happened.
Terribly sorry,mum.
He's really not so bad.
Are you,lonnie?
What did you say?
Oh,I was just talking to the cat,mum.
Say it again.
I was just saying that he's really not so bad.
Who?
Lonnie.
We named the cat lonnie.
We found him as a stray.
Just this morning it was.
Nightmares and Dreamscapes Season 01 Episode 06
So you know when you get back home tonight, you're staying with mrs.
Clausen,right?
Yes,ma.
And you'll be a good boy for her?
Yes,ma.
And she will put you on the bus in the morning, and I will be here after you get home from school tomorrow.
Yes,ma.
All right.
Off you go,then.
- I love you.
- I know.
Is dad coming home this time?
No,sweetheart.Not this time.
But soon.
Why can't I go with you?
Because it's nowhere for you to go.
But I want to see him.
Soon.
Real soon.
Off you go.
Go learn something.
So,how long you got now,willie?
6 weeks.
Best keep your nose clean,then.
A box of kleenex a day,officer.
How long do you think you'll be out this time?
Hey.
You all right?
Yeah.
- You want to...
- sit down?
Sure.
Almost seems like real life sometimes.
You got the families living here, it might even get more popular than it is.
Barney's gone.
- Gone?
Gone where?
- I don't know.
He just packed up and left.
You and him have a problem?
No.
No problem.
No problem.
Willie,it was fine.
You know barney.
He's easy to get along with.
He made friends with a man who worked there.
Old guy called mcfarland.
Not cappy mcfarland.
I don't know what his first name was.
Who is he?
Cappy's an ex-con.
Barney shouldn't have been hanging.
So they were hanging out a lot together.
They ate lunch together sometimes.
One day,I came home and they were sitting there,in the kitchen.
Were they planning something?
I don't know.
Barney never said anything and then about a week later,he just up and left.
He just left?
He didn't say anything to you?
Well,he called me once.
He said there was something he had to do.
When he was done,he'd be in touch.
And cappy?
He had cancer or something.
I heard he died.
How long ago was this?
About a month.
Just after my last visit.
I kept thinking barney'd come back,you know.
Mom,try that one.
Jackson kind of misses him.
How 'bout you?
You kinda miss him?
Yeah.
I kinda miss him,willie.
It was nice having somebody around.
Helped with jackson a lot.
Yeah.
I know.
It was your idea barney come live with us.
Yeah.
I know.
And he was grateful.
He always said you looked after him in here.
Maybe he... maybe he didn't want to involve you in something, you know... illegal.
Barney's a damn fool.
Yeah.
Well,just so long as you're not one.
You get out this time.
That's it.
You know that,willie.
I won't do another stretch.
I won't let jackson do another stretch.
You get out this time,you stay out.
That's the deal.
That's why I've hung in.
Yeah.
You're my wife.
If you can call it that.
18 months out of the last 10 years?
That's no wife.
It sure ain't no life.
The park is now closed.
Thank you for coming.
Remember,drive safely.
- Hi,karen.
- Hiya,thelma.
Hey,you been visitin' today?
Yeah.
How's willie?
He's hangin' in.
He's out soon,ain't he?
6 weeks,god willing.
Guess that's why you had to get rid of that young fella used to work here.
What was his name?
Barney.
Right?
He was a hunk.
How'd you find a lodger like that?
Uh,he was willie's cellmate.
What do you know!
If I thought I'd get a cellmate look like that, I'd rob a bank in a minute.
Home sweet home.
- Welcome back,willie.
- Thanks.
Dad!
- Thanks,mrs.
Clausen.
- You're welcome.
Bye,willie.
You're looking good.
Thanks.
Do you want to come inside?
Yeah.
- I drew some pictures for you.
- Oh,that's great.
Where you goin'?
Just gonna,uh-- check in on jackson.
See if he slept through it.
Felt like you got a load off your mind.
A load of something.
Don't know about my mind.
So,how did you manage inside?
What kind of question is that?
Ok.
Never mind.
No.
No.
You brought it up.
Why would you ask me something like that?
- 7 years is a long time.
- Tell me about it.
We're gonna get out of this dump.
I get through my parole,we'll move out west.
Barney and I used to talk about it.
Start something legit.
Well... looks like barney decided not to wait.
I asked around the joint where he was.
Cappy had a score planned, but he got too sick to do it.
So I think he was trying to get barney involved.
How's that?
Cappy's dead.
That's what I heard.
Well,let's hope barney didn't get past the talk.
Hey... what are the chances you can get me a job at the park?
If it doesn't close down first.
They don't have anything against hiring ex-cons.
What they don't like is paying a living wage.
Yeah.
Well... two non-living wages are better than one.
Yeah.
Yeah,that's the truth.
We're gonna make it.
You see if we don'T.
- Who'd that be?
- I don't know.
Barney!
Karen,towels.
Hey,willie.
- Glad to see you made it out.
- Hurry.
Let me see this.
Let me see this.
- Yeah.
Nice.
- Yeah.
- No,I'm fine.
- Barney,let me look at it.
Willie,willie.I'm fine.
I've got to talk to you.
What?
- Hey,karen.
- Hi,barney.
Go see if jackson woke up.
Go on.
It's all right.
What?
Huh?
Cappy mcfarland come to see me.
- You remember cappy?
- Yeah.
- He put this proposition to me.
- I thought we was going clean.
- Barney,what happened to that,barney?
- Willie,willie,willie.
This was a biggie,willie.
A biggie.
We're talking 3 and a half mil split 4 ways.
Beats serving cokes at the park.
All right.
Just let me look at this.
Oh!
Oh,god.
We gotta call 911.
Oh,no,no,no.
No,no cops.
Willie.
I'm not going back in.
Willie,he's hurt bad.
Let me get another towel.
- I thought cappy was a goner.
- Yeah.
Yeah,he's a goner.
He just got the team together and drove.
Who else?
Ok.
Guy called keenan.
Rich son of a bitch.
And another guy by the name of sarge.
Gulf war vet.
He's a bad mother.
And jagger.
Jagger.
He's even worse.
3 and a half mil.
New bills.
Numbered.
Have to be held.
You can't spend.
What happened to it?
Cappy hid it.
Why cappy?
Why,he was on his way out,you know.
His last job.
He,uh... he went to bury it before they buried him.
Didn't tell nobody where he made this map.
4 quarters.
Each piece had a letter on it with a name.
Buttercup... camellia... anemone... rosebud.
Hey,babe.
You want something for the pain?
Let me see if I can find something for the pain.
All right?
Yeah.
- Hold onto that.
- Ok.
She's the best,willie.
Yeah.
So,how'd this happen?
She just took pity on me,willie.
That's all it was.
Who shot you,barney?
Keenan.
Keenan.
He calls me up.
Says he's got a proposition.
Said he'd,uh... he'd buy my quarter.
Cash.
Cash I could spend.
How much?
100,000.
Against 3 quarters of a million.
That's a pretty big markdown.
Yeah.
But,willie.
Karen deserves it,you know.
She deserves it,willie, like you always said,you know.
So,you went to this keenan's?
Yeah.
I went to his place.
It's a big place up on ridge road.
811.
He asked me if I got it with me.
My quarter.
I was stupid.
I said,yeah, and he,uh... he plugs me.
He plugged me,willie.
Just like that.
You know?
Like a little pop gun, or else I'd be dead already.
Man,she's the best,willie.
I owe you,willie.
Lookin' out for me in the pen.
Owe karen looking out for me.
I'm giving you mine,willie.
- What?
- I'm giving you mine.
You and karen.
All right?
You go see him.
Take what's me and yours and karen'S.
Hear me,willie?
Get out of here.
Willie,can you hear me?
Yeah.
I'm right here,buddy.
I'm right here.
I'm right here,buddy.
It's all right.
No hard feeling's about me and karen.
Ok?
No h-hard feelings.
Willie.
Ok.
Barney.
Is he... yeah.
What was he saying?
I heard him say my name.
He was just rambling.
What are you doing?
What is that?
It's a part of a lottery ticket.
All right.
We should call the police.
Karen.
I don't want to go back,either.
You had nothing to do with this.
It's not how they'll see it.
This is about money from a robbery,isn't it?
It's what you mean about a lottery ticket?
You think these people are going to share it with you?
It's not theirs to share.
These people are dangerous.
Willie.
They killed barney.
And you don't think I should do anything about that?
What can you do?
Mom?
I told you he tried to hold me up.
He had a gun.
Said he'd shoot me if I didn't give him my quarter.
I keep a gun in my safe.
When he made me open it up,I got the drop on him.
Yeah.
Well,it surprised the hell out of me,too.
No.
He ran off.
I was too shocked.
I don't know where he went.
That's why I'm calling you.
I called jagger,too.
But he wasn't there so I left him a message.
He's out there somewhere is all I know and we've got to find him.
Yeah,sure,I'm scared.
I never shot anybody before.
No,I'm not going anywhere.
Put your hands on the counter and leave them there.
Who are you?
Just think of me as the fifth quarter.
You're a friend of barney'S.
He just tried to kill me.
- Not the way barney tells it.
- He's lying.
He came around.
Tried to sell me his quarter of the map.
When I refused,he pulled a gun, tried to make me hand mine over.
And you got the drop on him,right?
Who were you on the phone to?
Jagger or sarge?
He told you about...everything?
He told me what he could before he died.
Hands.
Leave 'em where I can see 'em.
He's dead?
Them gut shots'll do it every time.
So,where's the gun you shot him with?
It was self-defense.
All right.
Where's the self-defense weapon you shot him with?
Thought you kept it in the safe.
- I didn't put it back.
- All right.The way we do this-- you open the drawer,you don't put your hand in.
You step away.
All this is real slow.
Got it?
That's fine.
Enough!
Turn around.
It's a lady's gun,keenan.
You ain't got a lady there?
You don't want to mess with these people.
I wouldn't be messing with anyone if you hadn't shot barney.
I told you it was self-defense.
Listen,barney just died on me in my house, on my couch.
And he told me you tried to screw him out of his share.
I don't think he would have told me that with his last breath if it wasn't true.
So,you can cut this self-defense crap.
Let's just get your quarter of the map and we'll call it quits.
And what if I refuse to give it to you?
Now think about what one of those feels like in the gut and tell me you won't give me what I'm asking for.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Easy.
Hey!
Stop!
All right.
Keep going.
There you go.Put it on the...
that's right.
Easy.
Let me see those hands.
Who is that?
I don't know.
Well,find out.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
What?
Who is it?
It's sarge.
Buzz him in.
Buzz him in.
Now,get behind the bar and stay there until he's in the room.
You try to warn him and I'll kill you.
You hear me?
Shut up!
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Say,man.
Barney's car is still parked outside.
Now,he's got to be around here somewhere.
Keep them in the air,sarge.
Save me from shooting you.
And who the hell are you?
The way we play this is the guy with the gun gets to ask the questions.
Open your jacket with your left hand one button at a time.
Quit that whimpering,keenan.
It's a pretty big gun.
So,now you got two guns.
Still haven't told me who the hell you are.
I'm a friend of barney mars.
The late barney mars.
I told you,sarge.
He came around.
Shut up about that bullshit,keenan.
Didn't believe you the first time.
So I guess you know the kind of scumbag you're dealing with.
Yeah.
But you're the scumbag I don't know.
So barney's dead,and you want his piece of the map.
I already got barney's piece... and his.
Don't make me do it,sarge.
You haven't told me where your piece of the map is yet.
You're a pretty tough mother... for white trash.
Shut up!
Go check on him.
Keep those hands in the air.
Well?
Is he dead?
Getting there.
I think I'm gonna get a second opinion.
Move away.
Look.You've got his piece of the map, and you've got barney'S.
Ain't that enough?
That's more than I started with.
The way I see it,you and this other guy, jagger,you won't let me take half.
You won't even let me take barney's quarter.
So that means I'm gonna have to take it all.
That's greedy.
What makes the world go round.
And what if I don't give up my piece of the map?
Then I'll shoot out your kneecaps, make you get down on them and clean up the blood.
You're willie gansen.
Barney's bunk buddy from stir.
You know what's funny?
It didn't stop him from poking' your wife.
I got a real good look at her once.
Not bad for a hoochie mama.
I don't have it on me.
Well,then we best go get it.
Uh,where you going?
Just going to get my crunchies.
No,no,no,no, no,no,no,no,no.
It's the middle of the night.
Come on.
No.
Go to sleep.
Mom.
Listen carefully.
I let you go... you scream... you'll be gargling blood.
And then I do the boy.
Understood?
Now,tell me... and don't hold anything back... 'cause I can feel a lie starting before it even comes out of your mouth.
Tell me about barney.
So,now we got rosebud.
I'd say this is shaping up to be an island, sarge.How you supposed to know which one?
Huh?
Cappy said when the 4 quarters come together, we'd figure it out.
There's an awful lot of islands in maine.
Cappy didn't head off to polynesia,did he?
No.
Not the shape he was in.
It's around here someplace.
Yo-ho-ho on a dead man's chest,right?
Jagger.
How come you're such a hard ass all of a sudden,willie?
I mean,barney told me you two were going to go straight when you got out.
Well,it's not everyday you get out of the pen and find 3 and a half million bucks bleeding to death on your couch, telling you he was screwing your old lady but no hard feelings.
Kind of changes your perspective on things.
Got anyone else here?
Huh?
Up against the wall.
Middle of the room.
That's fine.
All right.
Where is it?
Make me an offer,willie.
I'll let you live.
How about that?
How about I don't believe you?
I told you,I'd shoot off your kneecap.
All right!
All right!
It's over there!
It's over there!
- Where?
- Inside the vase!
That wasn't so hard,now was it?
Camellia.
You're out of your depth,willie.
Way out.
Hell,man.
Get yourself shot sneaking up like that.
You know who this is,willie?
Anemone.
It's just you and me now.
Had a word with your old lady.
We had a real good understanding,me and her.
She told me what I wanted to know and I didn't cut her throat.
Cross my heart.
Hope to die.
You can feel a lie starting in the heart.
Did you know that,willie?
She told me you dumped barney buttercup, then went to see rosebud.
I didn't see you there,so I figured either sarge got you or you got sarge.
Either way... it's all coming back here.
Now,I could say why don't we split this, willie.
Two ways.
But you wouldn't need to have your hand on my heart to know I was bullshitting you.
So why don't we just get up on our hind legs, count to 10.
Last man standing takes all.
One.
2... 3... 4... 5...
6... 7,8,9!
Karen!
- Karen!
- Willie?
- Are you ok?
- Oh,my god.
- You're shot.
- Did he hurt you?
No.
He just scared me real bad.
Where's jackson?
I took him to mrs.
Clausen'S.
Come here.
Gotta get this seen to,willie.
The bullet's still in there.
Ex-cons with bullets in them got a lot of explaining to do.
Well,ex-cons with bullets in them die.
Listen,we have to figure out where this island is.
All right?
It's got to be somewhere close.
Eastern seaboard at least.
Cappy had to get there with the money and he was on his last legs from the sound of things.
It might not be the ocean?
It could be an island on a lake somewhere.
There's lots of them.
Listen... this thing with barney and me.
I don't want to-- I don't want to hear about that.
Listen to me,willie.
We just gave each other a little comfort.
In 7 years,that was the one and only.
And it wouldn't have happened if you hadn't have sent him here.
And it wouldn't have happened even then if it wasn't that barney really liked you.
Oh,there's a theory.
He told me about you and him.
About how you looked out for him... how it went down between you.
And I understood,willie.
I did and I didn't think bad of you... or of him.
That's all I'm asking.
Don't think bad of barney or... or of me.
Hold on.
It's the cops,willie.
All right.
Hide this.
Look,if they can't connect us to the robbery,we're ok.
And there's no reason they should.
I was in the can when it went down.
Hey.
You sure it's safe in there?
Yeah.
Till you get out.
All right.Listen to me.
You don't know nothing.
I went out last night.
You got no idea where.
I came back this morning shot.
All right.All right!
All right!
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Willie?
How you doing?
Detective.
Hi,mom.
Hey,babe.
I'm hungry.
What would you like?
Honey crunch.
- Wet or dry?
- Dry.
Ok.
Have a seat.
Where's dad?
Dad's had to go away for a little bit.
They,uh... they made a mistake about when he's supposed to get out.
Does that mean he won't be coming back for another while?
Yeah,but just for a little while this time.
What's this?
It's a word game I've been playing.
Like a crossword puzzle?
Yeah.
Kind of.
Buccaneers of the caribbean adventure ride?

*********** ********* camel li for a little bit,ok?
- All right.
- All right thanks.
So,that's your story,willie?
Barney's banging your old lady while you're in the can.
You have it out with him.
He shoots you,you grab the gun off him, plug him, and then get rid of his body.
That it?
'Course you'd have to produce the body.
Don't get cute.
Doesn't become you.
Our dogs sniffed out barney the dead guy not 200 feet from your trailer.
Self-defense.
Justifiable homicide.
Involuntary manslaughter.
Somewhere in there.
Whatever.
Looks like it's bye-bye,willie.
Must be a record for recidivism,though.
How long you been out,24 hours?
Seems like a lot longer.
Yeah!
Ew!
Hey, Billy, look...
Ah.
Are you all right, Billy?
Wrapping it up there, Billy?
Maybe not.
Okay, careful there, Woody.
You're gonna knock somebody over.
Billy...
Oh!
Billy, you know what?
I am saying stop.
This is your room, come on.
- I don't like it.
- Why not?
Smell the walls.
Mm... yeah.
You know what?
They just need a fresh coat of paint.
You can pick the color.
- Black.
- Black?
Cozy.
I don't wanna go to school, Mom.
I'm gonna be the new kid.
It's the worst thing ever.
How will I even know where to go?
We'll figure it out.
We?
No.
No mothers.
I want to meet your teacher Mrs. Bommley.
No, no mothers.
And I want to see your classroom and just make sure that everything's okay.
No mothers.
And also, Mom, don't put anything in my lunch like a little note saying, "Good luck, Billy."
Don't worry, I won't.
Okay, unpack, all right?
You're gonna feel so much better once you get settled in and get all your toys out.
Toys?
Material possessions.
Joe, Joe, look!
There's a new kid and he's riding his bike on the sidewalk.
- Look!
Boiler Head!
- Dismount, young man.
"And walk your bicycle.
Walk your bicycle."
Everybody, stare at him.
Billy F, is that where you're putting your bike?
- It's a bike rack.
- It's a bike rack.
- Billy F?
- Yeah, Billy F.
Billy F.
See you around, new kid.
Mrs. Bommley and Isaac...
No!
No, wait!
Aw, you stupid note.
Say you were lost.
I'm not lost.
Say you were though.
Okay, say I was.
Follow me.
Sorry, I'm so tall.
- Erk, Erk, Erk!
- Incoming!
- Incoming
- Coming in.
- Erk, Erk.
- Erk, Erk
Erk, Erk!
Put your stuff in there, and that's our classroom in there.
- Erk, Erk.
- Everyone calls that girl Erk.
- Erk?
- Erika.
No hats allowed.
Uh, please don't make me go in there.
Ow!
Oh!
Come, young man.
Sweet.
Class, you have a new student joining you today.
Everyone, let's welcome Billy with a warm hello.
- Class?
- Hello, Billy.
You're late.
Get to your seats.
Would you write your name on the board, young man?
Billy Forrester, with two Rs.
- Three.
- I beg your pardon?
There's three Rs.
Thank you, Mr. Burdock.
Welcome, Billy.
As part of our curriculum, we are studying Ancient Egypt.
Oh!
Thus the sphinx, thus the pyramids, thus the bust of Nefertiti.
Now, would you like to sit, Billy?
Let's see, let's find you a seat.
How about right there, in back of Erika?
Erk, Erk.
Tomorrow, make sure you put your backpack in the cubby, and welcome!
Erk, Erk.
- Erk.
- Erk, Erk, Erk.
Hey, have a delicious lunch.
Woo-hoo!
Hey!
Hey, Billy F.
That's your lunch, huh?
You eat worms?
I eat them all the time.
You want to try one?
Here you go.
Somebody get this off of me!
He's gonna get it now.
Everyone sit!
Boiler Head.
- He's gonna get it.
- Look at that.
I'm popular!
Woody, tell Billy and Daddy what you did today.
The pre-school kids are called sea turtles
- and when they introduced Woody...
- I sang a song!
He did.
He stood right up when they introduced him and he sang his little heart out, didn't you?
Oh, yeah?
What song did you sing, Woody?
Baby beluga in the deep blue sea
Swims so wild and swims so free
Heaven above, sea below
And the little white whale on the go...
Stop!
No more!
He's just singing, Billy.
He's not just singing.
He's deliberately not stopping!
The waves roll in
The waves roll out...
See the water squirting out of my spout.
- Dad?
- Billy, hey.
Couldn't tell if you were asleep.
My brain's keeping me awake.
What's the headline in that brain of yours?
I don't like my school.
Yeah, well, Billy, first days are tough.
First days can be really hard.
You should have seen me at work today.
You know, I, uh, I couldn't keep anyone's name straight.
Thanks, I'll be right with you, Bob.
It's Rob, Rob Simon.
And then they made me wear a name tag.
This is your IMB badge.
You're gonna need this when you go over to VOD because they're gonna ask for it for IOC.
Anything like that happen to you?
Not really.
Did you make any friends?
Everybody is already friends.
They all went to kindergarten probably.
And I'm just this kid who's just there all of a sudden.
Well, you know what you do?
You go up to people, you take the initiative, you say,
- "Hi, I'm Billy Forrester."
- Say my last name?
My point is, you don't wait for them to come to you, okay?
You go up to them, introduce yourself, shake hands.
Kids don't shake hands, Dad.
Try and get some sleep.
You know, things are gonna get better, I promise.
You watch, tomorrow you're gonna have a great day.
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
- Wormboy!
Wormboy!
- Stop!
- Wormboy!
- Get away!
- Wormboy!
Wormboy!
- Get off!
Wormboy!
Stop!
Get off!
We're just calling you Wormboy 'cause that's what you said.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
You said, "I eat worms." Right?
Right?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
So, you're Wormboy.
Wormboy.
We'll get back with you at recess.
Oh, hey.
Hey, does your house have a front door that's green?
I was trying to figure out where you live 'cause my house has a red door with a sign that says Tansey.
That's my name, Erika Tansey.
You're making it worse.
I'm Adam Simms.
I used to be friends with Frasier Boone.
You know Frasier Boone?
I don't know anybody, okay?
That's like me.
No friends.
I have lots of friends.
They just don't go to this dumb school.
Hey, you know how you threw a worm at Joe Guire and hit him in the face?
What about it?
I thought for sure he was gonna smash you with the death ring.
The death ring?
Joe has a ring called the death ring.
If he punches you with it, you die.
But you don't die now.
You die in eighth grade, so nobody can prove it.
It's got poison in it that goes into your skin and makes an ulcer.
Very slowly you bleed to death.
If he punches you with it?
He punched me.
And in the eight grade...
I'm gonna be dead.
What did you do to make him punch you in the first place?
Nothing.
He just said I was annoying him for some reason.
Uh, how hard did he punch you?
Really really hard.
Like this...
And then I fell down like this.
And it made a mark right here where the poison went in.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
You guys are stupid!
You can say Wormboy all you want.
I don't care!
Worms don't even taste hardly.
I had a whole bowl for breakfast with brown sugar and cold milk.
That's a lie.
Sometimes I boil them.
Sometimes I do them on the barbecue.
My favorite way, fried like French fries.
The greasier and the slimier the better.
Wormboy, you couldn't even eat one worm.
Right when it touched your tongue you'd puke.
- You want to bet?
- The smell would make you puke.
You couldn't even eat a quarter of a worm.
I can eat this many worms, Joe.
10 easy!
And you would be the one who'd puke just watching me.
Let's bet.
That I would eat 10 worms?
Yeah, and when you throw up you lose.
- Yeah.
- What if I don't lose?
- What's the bet, you mean?
- I know.
The loser has to come to school with worms in his pants.
Yeah, and he has to walk down the hall past everybody.
All right.
It's gonna be you Wormboy.
But Joe, what if he eats a tiny bit of worm, and then a year later a tiny bit more of a worm...
No, you gotta eat all 10 worms, all on the same day.
- And I get to pick them.
- When?
This Saturday.
That's the day after tomorrow.
I need more time to get ready.
Backing out?
Come on, Wormboy, shake on it.
Kids don't shake hands.
I said, shake on it!
It's a bet.
Oh!
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey.
- I had a thought.
You play tennis?
- Yup.
- How about Helen?
- Yeah.
Yeah we both play tennis.
You gotta come down to our club.
We'll play some doubles.
That's be great, Rob.
Great.
You and I, we played tennis when we first met a couple of times.
- You were good.
- Yeah, compared to you I was.
It's not that he asked me.
It's the way he asked me.
Like he was testing me.
Why are you looking at that?
Joe Guire told me to.
"Find out about worms," he said.
That's what they look like inside?
Yeah.
They have brains.
No eyes.
They're blind.
And look, five hearts.
And look at this interesting detail.
- Sphincter.
- That's the worm's butt.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter sphincter sphincter!
Stop, you guys!
I have to eat one.
I have to eat 10.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Boys...
"How the Ancient Egyptians
Preserved their Dead."
Fascinating topic, boys.
Fascinating.
The mystery of the sphinx.
excellent, excellent.
And on your recess too.
Oh, you're to be commended.
Carry on.
- Oh, that was close.
- Yeah.
excellent, excellent, boys!
Fascinating.
And on your recess too!
The lost sphincter of the sphinx.
The lost sphincter of the sphinx.
The lost sphinc...
You guys are friends with this guy, who's gonna be barfing his guts out tomorrow?
Donny, get over here.
You're not his friend.
He's Wormboy.
He doesn't have any friends.
- Bradley.
- Right here, Joe.
Tell him the new rule.
All 10 worms must be eaten by 7:00 P.M.
Or you lose.
And Bradley is the official timekeeper.
Why do you make all the rules?
Because...
he just does.
You won't even make it to 7:00.
'Cause we're making the worms taste bad.
Like they already don't?
Yeah, shut up, Twitch!
You too, Techno Mouth.
Benjy...
Benjy is the official worm cook.
You're gonna cook the worms?
I'm thinking up some disgusting recipes.
You're the one that said you like them fried, Wormboy.
We're making the worms taste nasty.
I see you, so quit hiding.
Just on my way home and I thought you might want to know
I might be leaving this place.
- Is your family moving again?
- No.
Just me.
Is this all because you threw a worm in Joe Guire's face?
That was really dumb!
Really dumb, wasn't it?
I loved it.
- You loved it?
- Yup, I loved it.
Whoa, you're good.
Thank you.
- Say I knew.
- Knew what?
- About the bet.
- You can't know, you're a girl.
Say I did though.
Say I also know you've never eaten a worm in your whole life.
- How would you know that?
- Because... why would you?
Did you know it was tomorrow?
And can I tell you something?
What?
I have a really weak stomach.
Really weak.
There are a lot of foods I can't eat.
Then why'd you make the stupid bet in the first place?
I don't know.
I was just trying to go to school and be a normal person.
Normal people don't eat worms, Billy.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, what do you think?
I'm naked.
All right, come on, we're going out.
- Where?
- Woody's school.
They're doing a performance and Woody's in it.
We're meeting your dad there.
Come on, I need you to put on a clean shirt.
What?
Up swim the sea turtles, up through the ocean waves.
And then down, down swim the sea turtles, dancing on the ocean waves.
Focus, sea turtles.
Focus.
Focus, sweetie.
Sea turtles
And the beluga in the deep blue sea.
- No, not... come here.
- Yeah!
Focus!
Focus!
I am the greatest.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Billy!
Hey, what are you doing out here?
They got cake inside.
I don't care.
I don't want any cake.
Don't want... don't want any cake?
Whose son are you?
He's just a showoff, Dad.
And everybody says, "Oh, he's so cute"
just because he's little.
I hate him.
- You don't hate your brother.
- Yes, I do!
And I hate this town we have to live in.
And the kids at my school,
- they're all...
- They're just kids, Billy.
They're just kids.
Kids are the same everywhere you go.
No.
No, they aren't.
These kids are different.
Different how?
Nothing.
Billy, your, uh, your mother and I, we, uh, met this woman inside.
She has a son, Benjy, he's in your class.
You know a Benjy?
I don't know anybody.
Well, she says... she says they're all playing soccer this afternoon.
- Soccer?
- Soccer, right.
At the field by the creek.
I'll get directions from her, okay?
No, they didn't ask me.
Billy, come on, when they see how good you are, they'll be begging you to play.
Mm, I don't have my cleats.
We'll go home and get them.
Come on, now you're just making excuses.
You know, you'll go, you'll have fun.
Look here, have some cake.
It's really... stale.
- What kind is it?
- Chocolate-covered stale cake.
I can't find any.
They're all over here, come on.
Whoa, look at this one!
- He's a find.
- Let me see it.
Hey, you gotta show that one to Joe.
He's really gonna puke, huh, Joe?
Yup, he's gonna spew his guts.
What if he doesn't?
What was that, Adam?
Huh?
Well, um... worms could just be like meat really.
You know, think of the first person who said,
"I'm gonna eat a chicken."
Then he ate it and it was just a chicken.
Then we have to find out.
Someone get a worm.
- Come here.
- Me?
Don't spit it out.
Chew it.
Chew, Adam.
My God!
Whoa!
Perfect.
You see, that was one worm.
Wormboy has to eat 10.
Joe has a ring called the death ring.
If he punches you with it you die.
But you don't die now.
You die in the eighth grade, so nobody can prove it.
It's got poison in it that goes into your skin and makes an ulcer.
Very slowly, you bleed to death.
Death.
I'm running away.
Ow!
I can't run away.
Where will I go?
I've got to do it.
If we don't fight the evil forces, they'll destroy our planet.
Beat the evil forces!
Billy, I need to talk to you.
Billy, I want you to look after Woody today, all right?
Don't let him get in any trouble.
- Woody?
- Yeah, Woody.
Make sure he gets lunch, all right?
We'll be back for supper.
No, Dad, no!
Billy, you don't have a choice in the matter, okay?
I need to be fo...
focused today, okay?
So do I!
I need to be focused.
No, you don't need to be focused.
It's Saturday.
You get to do whatever you want.
Just include your brother.
Okay, listen, Wood, you're little, okay?
So you don't even know anything, okay?
So today, for the whole day you have to obey me.
You know what that means?
Be your slave?
Well, yeah, kind of.
What are you doing?
Trying to drool on those ants.
Ugh!
Listen to me, Wood.
You know how we moved here and how everything is different?
Like our house and your school.
Well, it's the same thing with me.
I'm not the same brother you had before.
I'm a whole other person.
And everything you remember about your old brother, all isn't true about your new brother.
For instance, I've never been sick.
- I've seen you sick.
- Woody.
You threw up at Raging Waters and they had to drain the whole pool.
That wasn't me!
Don't you get it?
And don't pick your nose!
What, you're gonna pick your nose all day?
You're hurting my bike!
I'm not hurting your bike.
I can't hurt a person's bike.
Well, you're shaking it and it's hitting my dilly-dink.
Don't say stuff like that.
My dilly-dink is my penis.
I'm gonna eat the worms.
Okay.
And, um... what are you doing today?
Why?
I have to babysit my little brother.
Where is he?
Get this stuff off me!
- Joey the Joke.
- Give me it, Nigel.
- Heard a story about you today, Joke.
- What story?
- Something about a worm.
- The bet, you mean?
You tell me, Joke.
Well, this new kid at our school, I
- I'm making him eat 10 worms and...
Same guy who threw a worm in your face?
- Who told you that?
- Your dumb friend, Plug.
Plug told you?
Actually he told his sister and she told me.
Said the whole school was laughing and that you were afraid.
Were you afraid, Joke, of a little worm?
I wasn't afraid.
Joke.
Joke.
You're a joke.
Get out of here, crows!
Get out of my kitchen!
Look what happens when you put them on a gummy worm.
Whoa, look at them.
They're having a spasmodic convulsión.
Hey guys, here comes Joe.
- Plug.
- Yeah.
Come here.
- What did I do?
- Ask your sister.
Benjy, how are you gonna cook them?
- With this stuff.
- What is it?
- Lard.
- Is that like butter?
Lard's from a pig.
It's the fat.
Pig fat.
Make sure you tell Wormboy that.
Yeah, look at it.
10 seems like so many.
Why did you make it 10?
Because I said I could eat 10.
But I didn't mean it.
And Joe said, "You said..."
I couldn't back out because I did say it, you know what I mean?
Not really.
Hey, Joe, there he is.
Hey, Wormboy, that's your team, huh?
You and her, and who's that little kid?
He's got training wheels.
Hey, Wormboy!
Wormboy?
Let me give you another person.
You know, help you out.
Make things fair.
Adam, go.
Wormboy!
You're gonna see stuff today, Woody, and it's just normal stuff that big kids do.
And big kids never tell their parents.
- Do you understand?
- Billy, I have to go poo.
Oh, Jeez.
I can't help it, it's making me.
- What is?
- Everything.
Woody, come with me.
Billy, go.
All right, let's go.
Pig fat was not part of the bet.
You're the one that said you liked them fried, Wormboy.
"The greasier, the slimier the better," you said.
Worm number one:
"Le Big Porker."
What are you talking like that for?
I'm French.
Go on, Wormboy.
Eat it.
Bon appetit.
Yuck, worm juice!
It squirted right on me.
Go on, Wormboy, eat it before all the guts run out.
He did it.
Oh, gross!
Ugh!
Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.
I don't like where I'm sitting.
Look out, you guys!
I think he's gonna puke already.
Where's the worm?
- Let's see.
- I don't think it's sanitary.
You have to swallow it, Wormboy, all of it.
There's chunks in there he hasn't even chewed yet.
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Hey kids, no fires in the park without adult supervisión!
Want to make a wish, Woody?
Here's what you do.
Take a little stone and go like this,
I wish I had a horse
That I could ride ride ride.
Here, now you try.
I wish my brother was dead dead dead.
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Hey, make sure he doesn't spit it out!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Billy!
Ugh!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Hey, you guys!
He ate it, Joe, look.
Yeah, I see him Benjy.
So what are we gonna do now?
We got no place to cook them.
Come on, you guys, we need somebody's kitchen.
- My family is vegetarian.
- No way.
Hey, I know, Adam Simms.
His uncle owns The Brown Toad.
My uncle hates me.
You boys know what you want?
You're taking up the whole counter there.
- Uh, we're still deciding, sir.
- Yeah.
Adam!
- Oh, hi, Uncle Ed.
- What's this?
I was just, um, giving you a hand in here.
Last time you gave me a hand you nearly chopped your thumb off.
Yuck!
Here, just wear this.
Don't muck up the works.
Adam!
Faster!
Cook faster.
Oh, no.
Ugh!
Hey hey hey!
You're gonna burn down my restaurant!
- But Uncle Ed...
- Stay back!
Stay back!
There you go.
Omelet up.
Ding ding.
Boiler Head.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Hello, boys.
Come on over here.
Come on.
You boys up to something?
You look a little mischievous.
Do you know, that I used to come to The Brown Toad when I was a kid?
Yeah.
Oh, root beer float and a bacon burger... by golly, I was in heaven.
Alley-oop.
Mm.
Mm mm mm.
Mm, that's a good omelet.
He ate the whole worm!
The principal of our school!
"When I was a boy I ate root beer floats, by golly!"
Why did he say alley-oop?
- Yeah.
- Maybe he's nuts.
Yeah!
I am Boiler Head.
Alley-oop!
Alley-oop, alley-oop,
Alley-oop, alley-oop.
- Donny!
- Alley-oop, alley-oop...
I'm sorry.
We're just laughing, Joe.
I wasn't asking you, Wormboy.
Adam!
What's this box of bugs doing in my restaurant?
You're gonna have the health department on my case.
Get out of here!
All of you!
Punks!
Don't worry, you guys.
I cooked the worm.
I seriously cooked it.
I cooked two worms at once.
See, two of them.
Oh, cool.
How did you make it so lumpy?
I dunked it in the French fry fryer and then smeared liver juice all over it.
Liver juice?
I was trying to cover the worm taste.
Hey, you guys, I should name it.
How about "The Greasy Brown Toad
Bloater Special"?
Plug!
What's the matter, not French enough for you?
All right, go on, Wormboy.
Eat it.
Ew!
Ugh!
Why are they guarding him, Adam?
In case he throws up.
'Cause what if he wanted to cheat?
He could throw up and never tell.
So Joe made Plug and Bradley the official puke watchers.
Adam, are you positive Twitch is okay with this?
Sure.
No!
Please!
They're gonna kill...
- Tomato paste.
- And put this cheese in.
Smell it.
It smells like a person's armpit.
You guys!
You can't just steal everything.
- Are we allowed to eat a pickle?
- No.
Your dog is walking sideways, Twitch.
No no, she has arthritis.
Oh, my eyes are burning.
- No!
- What all's in there?
Louisiana Hot Sauce sauce.
So hot it'll blow a person's head off.
Bam bam bam!
No!
No!
It's ready.
The "Burning Fireball."
All right, I'll go get him.
No!
Ah!
Man.
Hey, guys, bring him in.
No!
I'm not ready yet.
I gotta go watch, 'cause this one's gonna be ugly.
Wait for me, you guys!
Erika, watch me!
Boys are so weird.
He can't even stand the smell.
Hot hot hot hot!
It's burning!
Come on, Wormboy, eat the whole thing.
Sick.
He's gonna blow!
It's over!
It's all over.
Everyone just stand back.
Stand back, you guys.
- Just open your mouth, Wormboy.
- Water!
No water!
It's a new rule.
No more cooking in my house!
The door is locked!
And... and... and I quit your team, Joe!
Who cares if you quit?
All you are is Twitch, you little loser.
Anybody else?
Huh?
Want to go on Wormboy's team?
Yeah!
Me.
Me too, Joe!
You're already on his team, Adam.
Yeah, but you made me be.
But now I want to.
That's different
- Here you go, Billy.
- Ahh!
- Turn it off, Adam!
- Turn it off!
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying.
Here, come on.
Look, Benjy, you got to do better, okay?
- I practically poisoned him.
- Then why didn't it work?
Wormboy stopped himself with mental powers.
- What?
- His mind told his vomit to stay inside of his stomach.
That's impossible.
Yeah, puke has a mind of its own.
You almost took my head off, Adam.
Here you go.
Don't...
- I'm okay.
- Hy-ah!
- I got it!
Oh!
- Hoo-ah!
Oh!
Okay, this...
- this is not going well.
- Where are you going?
- This is... this is bad.
- What?
- We're terrible.
We're terrible.
- What?
I got bad shorts.
People are staring at us.
This is bad.
Oh, that's him.
Look alive, here they come.
Here they come.
That's the guy you're afraid of?
Huh.
I'm not the kind of guy
Who gives up just like that...
Oh no oh oh
- The tide is high...
- Yup yup.
But I'm holding on...
- Ow!
- Honey!
We're a team, right?
- And we're gonna beat Joe Guire.
- Yeah!
And we're gonna make him come to school with worms in his pants.
- Yeah!
- And when he does...
He's gonna punch us all with the death ring and we're all gonna die like Adam Simms.
Hey, but that's not till the eighth grade, right?
Where is Adam?
- Adam?
- Oh, oh, oh.
Come on, man, go go!
Keep on going!
- No no no.
- Yeah, keep going!
- Come on!
- Come on!
Let's go!
Whoo!
Get down.
Faster!
- Faster!
- Faster!
Faster!
Whoo!
Whoo!
- Look out, Billy!
- Billy!
Hey, what's going on back there?
- Game over!
- Let's get out of here!
- Run run!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
Get out!
Get out of my store.
Are you ready?
One little bird fell out of the nest
When the cat ate him up
- His mama said it's for the best.
- Two bird.
Two little bird flapped his wings and flew
He met an aeroplane and said, boom
- How do you do?
- It's Erika.
Hey, you guys!
- It's Erk.
- Stop!
Joe, stop!
You're touching my bike.
Yeah yeah.
Is the bet over?
You're a girl, you don't know about the bet.
- Where's Billy?
- Erk, let go!
Look, we're going to Plug's house, okay?
His dad's got a blowtorch.
Tell me where Billy is.
We can't keep up with you guys.
Who asked you to?
I'm looking after Billy's brother.
So that's who that kid is?
He's Wormboy's little brother?
Don't talk to him, Woody.
Do you wanna know where Billy is or don't you?
Hey, Woody.
Have you ever seen your brother throw up?
He doesn't know what you're talking about, Joe.
Sure he does.
Yeah, he got sick from chicken pox, too much Halloween, and putting tooth paste on a light bulb.
And he got sick at the zoo from watching a pig lick itself!
What else did he get sick from?
Car sick.
Oh, yeah?
Mo-wo-wotion sickness.
Thanks, you little midget.
What happened to the blowtorch, Plug?
My dad just laughed at me.
Ha ha ha.
Magni-fried.
What's all this?
Crushed up marshmallow, dash of ketchup and tuna fish from a can.
I call it the "Marsh Mallieu."
How about "Barf Mallieu"?
"Barf-mellow." Thanks, Adam.
Oops.
Sorry, Billy.
The worm, the sauce.
Oh!
Alley-oopa, gentille alley-oopa.
I can do this.
Whoo!
Oh, yeah, I'm Wormboy!
Stomach of steel!
Ooo!
I ate the whole Barfmel...
whoa!
Oh!
Oops.
Are you okay, Billy?
- Billy, are you okay?
- "Billy, are you okay?"
Erk!
Erk!
- Billy!
- Billy, are you okay?
- Oh, Billy.
- Poor thing.
Get away, Erika.
You big giant.
Oh!
- Oh, that hurts.
- Erk!
Go on, Erika.
- You big giant!
- Erk!
- Aw!
Bye!
- Have a nice day.
Give him another one, Benjy.
Peanut butter and worm jam sandwich.
Billy the Great.
Woody!
Mommy!
Mommy!
- Oh my God!
Oh, okay, um...
- Shoot!
Chew!
Come here!
Come here, baby!
Chew it!
- Billy!
- Swallow.
Hey, there you are.
When are you coming home for supper?
Supper?
Yeah, supper.
You gonna introduce me, Billy?
How are you doing, guys?
I'm Billy's father.
- How are you doing, Mr. Forrester?
- Hey!
- Joe Guire.
- Joe Guire, nice to meet you.
You see that, Billy?
Kids do shake hands.
What have you guys been up to all day, boys?
- Playing, you know.
- Playing, yeah.
- And having fun.
- Yeah.
Great, great.
You know, it's suppertime, sir, and we all have to go home and have a nice big supper.
Don't we, Billy?
Right you are, Joe.
Tell you what, Billy, we're gonna take the Woodster with us.
He looks a little tired.
And we'll see you at home.
Bye, Mr. Forrester.
- What time is it, Bradley?
- 5:03, Joe.
This is perfect.
Gotta go home and gobble down your supper.
Don't even think about puking, 'cause you never know who's watching.
Bye.
Three whole worms to go.
See, the trick with chopsticks is to pinch them like so.
And then it's all in the wrist.
What's the matter, honey?
Aren't you hungry?
Of course he's hungry.
Out riding bikes around all day.
How many games did we play today, Helen?
One, but it went on forever.
- Mommy?
- Yes, sweetie.
What is it, honey?
Oh.
- Oh, hey, Wood.
- Poor thing.
- Woody, come on.
- Oh, honey.
- I'll give him a bath.
- Okay.
I got you, oh, baby.
Aw, little guy.
He's tuckered out, that little duffer.
Looks like you ran him ragged, didn't you?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
It's getting late and they're all going out again.
And... and...
What's going on?
I've been eating worms all day.
What?
Well, I didn't want to, but then when I started I had to keep going.
And it made me feel awful.
It's okay.
It's okay, Billy, I understand.
I do.
I've eaten a few worms myself this past week.
- You have?
- Yeah.
I'm the new guy too, remember?
Trying to fit in.
Trying to please others.
A worm here and a worm there, I know what that tastes like.
You're not talking about real worms, are you, Dad?
I'm talking about adjusting to a new situation.
You know, I saw all those boys today.
It's a lot of boys to meet all at once too, isn't it?
Yeah, well, they're not all as nice as you think they are.
Careful there, Billy.
You don't want to judge them too quickly.
Take it from me.
You... you want to give people time.
I'm not hungry at all.
Eat up, Billy.
You don't want to go outside on an empty stomach.
Move!
Billy.
What are you guys doing?
Time's running out.
And Joe wants everybody to meet him down by the river.
Why the river?
There's an old lady that lives down there.
People say she's a witch.
She sells worms to fishermen.
Huge ones, long as a person's arm.
Don't tell him that, Adam.
L- l-I meant, long as a cat's arm.
Where's Twitch?
Grounded 'cause we wrecked his house, and destroyed it.
I can't eat anymore worms, you guys!
I'm gonna quit.
You can't quit.
If you quit then you lose.
Then we all lose.
This is our one chance not to be losers!
- Woody!
- When the cat ate him up
His mama said it's for the best.
- Where did you learn that song?
- Erika.
Erika.
She'll know how to get me out of this stupid dumb bet.
What are you thinking of her for?
She's a girl!
And, Billy, you called her a big fat giant, remember?
- I didn't say fat.
- Yeah, but still.
Erika would never be mad at me.
We're friends.
- Rat!
- No wait, you don't get it.
Don't get what?
That you're just turning into another Joe?
- I'm not a Joe.
- You were being mean like him.
And you're acting like some person that you're not.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't being mean on purpose.
You try eating worms with marshmallows and ketchup on them.
Joe Guire is cruel to people, Billy, and it's all 'cause people let him.
They just do what he says and he goes around making rules up.
And you're the first person that ever did anything.
- What did I do?
- You challenged him!
- Well, I wish I never did.
- And so will he when this is over.
Joe Guire is a bully.
Make him come to school with worms in his pants and no one will ever be scared of him again.
What about the death ring though?
It's just a dumb old ring he wears to scare people, Billy.
Win this bet and that ring will mean nothing.
I've never been in there before.
- Have you, Joe?
- No.
But my brother went in there once, he just saw fishing stuff.
It was really gross and spooky inside.
You think Wormboy is gonna show?
If he doesn't...
I win the bet.
There she is.
Some people call her the two-headed witch.
You know why?
She had two heads once, but one fell off.
The one that fell off is in that bag she carries around all the time.
Donny, what's that noise?
It's Benjy.
Benjy!
Benjy!
Ssh!
She's not very friendly looking.
I wonder what her other head looks like.
Ssh.
"Gone to catch me some supper."
Plug, try the door.
Why me?
Just do it, okay?
Oh, it's stinky!
Oh, gross.
Interesting.
They've got dead fish corpses hanging from the ceiling.
What do you mean, dead fish corpses?
That's not funny!
What are you laughing at, Bradley?
Nothing.
It's just that you seemed kind of...
Scared!
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm just scared for you, Wormboy, that's all.
'Cause there's big giant night crawlers in there.
From Canada, my brother said.
Which means they're gigantic.
We better get started then.
What time is it, Bradley?
You don't ask Bradley what time it is.
He's on my team.
Whatever you say, Joe.
You make the rules.
- 6:35, Joe.
- Yeah, okay.
Hey you guys, guess what I found?
Green ones!
Who's got $2?
How about that for technology?
It's like buying a Coke.
Wait, what are these cups for?
- Plug?
- Yeah.
If Joe loses the bet, you think he'll really walk through our school with worms in his pants?
We can't let him lose the bet.
We're on his team.
Yeah.
But sometimes I wish I wasn't on his team.
Like back at The Brown Toad, when he yelled at me,
I wanted to quit his team!
Then why didn't you?
I'm not brave, I guess.
Ugh, they really are green.
Green goes with green.
Spinach from a can, crown of broccoli.
"Viola!"
You got a worm, Bradley?
It just went to the bathroom on my hand.
Ugh.
The "Green Slusher" served in a bed of slush at room temperature.
Bring it on.
Ugh!
You made it too thick, Benjy.
Looks like wasabi.
Canadian night crawlers.
There's something I've always wanted to try.
I'm naming this one
"Radioactive Slime Delight."
I wonder what he's thinking about.
Perfect.
There you go, Wormboy.
You might need this.
Who's that trespassing in my bait shop?
- I'm getting out of here.
- Watch out!
- Come on, let's go.
What are you doing?
- A bet's a bet!
What?
What are you doing in here?
Get out of here!
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of the way of the head!
I think she went inside.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
Let's go.
Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go!
Wait!
Wait, you guys!
Hey you guys, wait!
Wait up!
Wait up!
Wait up!
Wait for me.
She was right there.
Right there!
She hit me in the head...
with her head.
You didn't throw up, did you?
What are you doing here, Twitch?
I'm on your team, Billy.
One worm to go.
What time is it, Bradley?
- 6:52, Joe.
- What's going on?
They're digging for worms, Joe.
Yeah, but they won't find any here anyway.
We will too!
Time's running out, Wormboy.
- Two minutes, Joe.
- We'll never make it.
There aren't any worms around here anywhere.
- There's got to be!
- There's not, Billy!
We're gonna lose.
We'll never find a worm.
We might as well just...
- A worm!
- Eat it, Billy!
Come on, eat it!
Make Joe come to school with worms in his pants!
- No!
- Move!
No!
That's not fair.
You're a cheater.
Go, Billy!
Go Billy!
Go!
39 seconds.
Go go go go!
Get it!
Get it!
Yeah!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
10 seconds!
Nine, eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two...
Boys are so weird!
Hey, Joke.
Now you really are a joke.
Wha... what are you doing here, Nige?
I came all the way here to see you win.
Now the whole school's gonna be laughing at you.
They're gonna be laughing at me too 'cause I'm your brother.
Leave him alone.
I think you might want to stay out of this.
Leave him alone.
Yeah, leave him alone.
Bunch of little worms.
You won.
Shake on it.
Kids don't shake hands.
Shake.
Two sock...
yes, got it.
Got it.
- Week number two, Billy.
- Yeah.
Last Monday seems like a long time ago.
What's the headline?
Cheating.
- Cheating?
- Yeah.
If you cheat at something and you win, and nobody knows you cheated, do you still win?
The only way to win is by playing fair.
But what if you didn't even know you cheated.
Then would it be okay?
Sounds to me like you already know the answer, Billy.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Billy.
Bye, Wormboy.
See you later, Wood.
- I didn't win.
- Yeah, you did, Billy.
You ate all 10 worms.
I only ate nine.
Then how come we counted 10?
The 10th one was eaten by Boiler Head.
The omelet.
What are we gonna do?
Oh!
Hey, there's Joe!
Oh, there he is!
Look, it's Billy!
What's he doing?
Ew!
No way!
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
- Jungle boogie...
- Come on.
Jungle boogie, get it on
Jungle boogie, down with the boogie
Jungle boogie, get it on
Jungle boogie, get up with the boogie
Jungle boogie, get up with the get down
Jungle boogie, down with the boogie
Jungle boogie, shake it around...
Jungle Boogie.
What's going on out here?
Good morning, Mr. Boiler...
I mean, good afternoon, Mr. Burdock.
Good afternoon, Mr. Burdock.
Adam Simms...

Yup, just walking along.

Yum yum yum.
Yeah!
Ew!
Hey, Billy, look...
Ah.
Are you all right, Billy?
Wrapping it up there, Billy?
Maybe not.
Okay, careful there, Woody.
You're gonna knock somebody over.
Billy...
Oh!
Billy, you know what?
I am saying stop.
This is your room, come on.
- I don't like it.
- Why not?
Smell the walls.
Mm... yeah.
You know what?
They just need a fresh coat of paint.
You can pick the color.
- Black.
- Black?
Cozy.
I don't wanna go to school, Mom.
I'm gonna be the new kid.
It's the worst thing ever.
How will I even know where to go?
We'll figure it out.
We?
No.
No mothers.
I want to meet your teacher Mrs. Bommley.
No, no mothers.
And I want to see your classroom and just make sure that everything's okay.
No mothers.
And also, Mom, don't put anything in my lunch like a little note saying, "Good luck, Billy."
Don't worry, I won't.
Okay, unpack, all right?
You're gonna feel so much better once you get settled in and get all your toys out.
Toys?
Material possessions.
Joe, Joe, look!
There's a new kid and he's riding his bike on the sidewalk.
- Look!
Boiler Head!
- Dismount, young man.
"And walk your bicycle.
Walk your bicycle."
Everybody, stare at him.
Billy F, is that where you're putting your bike?
- It's a bike rack.
- It's a bike rack.
- Billy F?
- Yeah, Billy F.
Billy F.
See you around, new kid.
Mrs. Bommley and Isaac...
No!
No, wait!
Aw, you stupid note.
Say you were lost.
I'm not lost.
Say you were though.
Okay, say I was.
Follow me.
Sorry, I'm so tall.
- Erk, Erk, Erk!
- Incoming!
- Incoming
- Coming in.
- Erk, Erk.
- Erk, Erk
Erk, Erk!
Put your stuff in there, and that's our classroom in there.
- Erk, Erk.
- Everyone calls that girl Erk.
- Erk?
- Erika.
No hats allowed.
Uh, please don't make me go in there.
Ow!
Oh!
Come, young man.
Sweet.
Class, you have a new student joining you today.
Everyone, let's welcome Billy with a warm hello.
- Class?
- Hello, Billy.
You're late.
Get to your seats.
Would you write your name on the board, young man?
Billy Forrester, with two Rs.
- Three.
- I beg your pardon?
There's three Rs.
Thank you, Mr. Burdock.
Welcome, Billy.
As part of our curriculum, we are studying Ancient Egypt.
Oh!
Thus the Sphinx, thus the pyramids, thus the bust of Nefertiti.
Now, would you like to sit, Billy?
Let's see, let's find you a seat.
How about right there, in back of Erika?
Erk, Erk.
Tomorrow, make sure you put your backpack in the cubby, and welcome!
Erk, Erk.
- Erk.
- Erk, Erk, Erk.
Hey, have a delicious lunch.
Woo-hoo!
Hey!
Hey, Billy F.
That's your lunch, huh?
You eat worms?
I eat them all the time.
You want to try one?
Here you go.
Somebody get this off of me!
He's gonna get it now.
Everyone sit!
Boiler Head.
- He's gonna get it.
- Look at that.
I'm popular!
Woody, tell Billy and Daddy what you did today.
The pre-school kids are called sea turtles
- and when they introduced Woody...
- I sang a song!
He did.
He stood right up when they introduced him and he sang his little heart out, didn't you?
Oh, yeah?
What song did you sing, Woody?
# Baby beluga in the deep blue sea #
# Swims so wild and swims so free #
# Heaven above, sea below #
# And the little white whale on the go... #
Stop!
No more!
He's just singing, Billy.
He's not just singing.
He's deliberately not stopping!
# The waves roll in #
# The waves roll out... #
# See the water squirting out of my spout. #
- Dad?
- Billy, hey.
Couldn't tell if you were asleep.
My brain's keeping me awake.
What's the headline in that brain of yours?
I don't like my school.
Yeah, well, Billy, first days are tough.
First days can be really hard.
You should have seen me at work today.
You know, I, uh, I couldn't keep anyone's name straight.
Thanks, I'll be right with you, Bob.
It's Rob, Rob Simon.
And then they made me wear a name tag.
This is your IMB badge.
You're gonna need this when you go over to VOD because they're gonna ask for it for IOC.
Anything like that happen to you?
Not really.
Did you make any friends?
Everybody is already friends.
They all went to kindergarten probably.
And I'm just this kid who's just there all of a sudden.
Well, you know what you do?
You go up to people, you take the initiative, you say,
- "Hi, I'm Billy Forrester."
- Say my last name?
My point is, you don't wait for them to come to you, okay?
You go up to them, introduce yourself, shake hands.
Kids don't shake hands, Dad.
Try and get some sleep.
You know, things are gonna get better, I promise.
You watch, tomorrow you're gonna have a great day.
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
- Wormboy!
Wormboy!
- Stop!
- Wormboy!
- Get away!
- Wormboy!
Wormboy!
- Get off!
Wormboy!
Stop!
Get off!
We're just calling you Wormboy 'cause that's what you said.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
You said, "I eat worms." Right?
Right?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
So, you're Wormboy.
Wormboy.
We'll get back with you at recess.
Oh, hey.
Hey, does your house have a front door that's green?
I was trying to figure out where you live 'cause my house has a red door with a sign that says Tansey.
That's my name, Erika Tansey.
You're making it worse.
I'm Adam Simms.
I used to be friends with Frasier Boone.
You know Frasier Boone?
I don't know anybody, okay?
That's like me.
No friends.
I have lots of friends.
They just don't go to this dumb school.
Hey, you know how you threw a worm at Joe Guire and hit him in the face?
What about it?
I thought for sure he was gonna smash you with the death ring.
The death ring?
Joe has a ring called the death ring.
If he punches you with it, you die.
But you don't die now.
You die in eighth grade, so nobody can prove it.
It's got poison in it that goes into your skin and makes an ulcer.
Very slowly you bleed to death.
If he punches you with it?
He punched me.
And in the eight grade...
I'm gonna be dead.
What did you do to make him punch you in the first place?
Nothing.
He just said I was annoying him for some reason.
Uh, how hard did he punch you?
Really really hard.
Like this...
And then I fell down like this.
And it made a mark right here where the poison went in.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
Wormboy!
You guys are stupid!
You can say Wormboy all you want.
I don't care!
Worms don't even taste hardly.
I had a whole bowl for breakfast with brown sugar and cold milk.
That's a lie.
Sometimes I boil them.
Sometimes I do them on the barbecue.
My favorite way, fried like French fries.
The greasier and the slimier the better.
Wormboy, you couldn't even eat one worm.
Right when it touched your tongue you'd puke.
- You want to bet?
- The smell would make you puke.
You couldn't even eat a quarter of a worm.
I can eat this many worms, Joe.
10 easy!
And you would be the one who'd puke just watching me.
Let's bet.
That I would eat 10 worms?
Yeah, and when you throw up you lose.
- Yeah.
- What if I don't lose?
- What's the bet, you mean?
- I know.
The loser has to come to school with worms in his pants.
Yeah, and he has to walk down the hall past everybody.
All right.
It's gonna be you Wormboy.
But Joe, what if he eats a tiny bit of worm, and then a year later a tiny bit more of a worm...
No, you gotta eat all 10 worms, all on the same day.
- And I get to pick them.
- When?
This Saturday.
That's the day after tomorrow.
I need more time to get ready.
Backing out?
Come on, Wormboy, shake on it.
Kids don't shake hands.
I said, shake on it!
It's a bet.
Oh!
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey.
- I had a thought.
You play tennis?
- Yup.
- How about Helen?
- Yeah.
Yeah we both play tennis.
You gotta come down to our club.
We'll play some doubles.
That's be great, Rob.
Great.
You and I, we played tennis when we first met a couple of times.
- You were good.
- Yeah, compared to you I was.
It's not that he asked me.
It's the way he asked me.
Like he was testing me.
Why are you looking at that?
Joe Guire told me to.
"Find out about worms," he said.
That's what they look like inside?
Yeah.
They have brains.
No eyes.
They're blind.
And look, five hearts.
And look at this interesting detail.
- Sphincter.
- That's the worm's butt.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter sphincter sphincter!
Stop, you guys!
I have to eat one.
I have to eat 10.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
Sphincter.
- Sphincter.
- Boys...
"How the Ancient Egyptians
Preserved their Dead."
Fascinating topic, boys.
Fascinating.
The mystery of the Sphinx.
Excellent, excellent.
And on your recess too.
Oh, you're to be commended.
Carry on.
- Oh, that was close.
- Yeah.
Excellent, excellent, boys!
Fascinating.
And on your recess too!
The lost sphincter of the Sphinx.
The lost sphincter of the Sphinx.
The lost sphinc...
You guys are friends with this guy, who's gonna be barfing his guts out tomorrow?
Donny, get over here.
You're not his friend.
He's Wormboy.
He doesn't have any friends.
- Bradley.
- Right here, Joe.
Tell him the new rule.
All 10 worms must be eaten by 7:00 P.M.
Or you lose.
And Bradley is the official timekeeper.
Why do you make all the rules?
Because...
he just does.
You won't even make it to 7:00.
'Cause we're making the worms taste bad.
Like they already don't?
Yeah, shut up, Twitch!
You too, Techno Mouth.
Benjy...
Benjy is the official worm cook.
You're gonna cook the worms?
I'm thinking up some disgusting recipes.
You're the one that said you like them fried, Wormboy.
We're making the worms taste nasty.
I see you, so quit hiding.
Just on my way home and I thought you might want to know
I might be leaving this place.
- Is your family moving again?
- No.
Just me.
Is this all because you threw a worm in Joe Guire's face?
That was really dumb!
Really dumb, wasn't it?
I loved it.
- You loved it?
- Yup, I loved it.
Whoa, you're good.
Thank you.
- Say I knew.
- Knew what?
- About the bet.
- You can't know, you're a girl.
Say I did though.
Say I also know you've never eaten a worm in your whole life.
- How would you know that?
- Because... why would you?
Did you know it was tomorrow?
And can I tell you something?
What?
I have a really weak stomach.
Really weak.
There are a lot of foods I can't eat.
Then why'd you make the stupid bet in the first place?
I don't know.
I was just trying to go to school and be a normal person.
Normal people don't eat worms, Billy.
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, what do you think?
I'm naked.
All right, come on, we're going out.
- Where?
- Woody's school.
They're doing a performance and Woody's in it.
We're meeting your dad there.
Come on, I need you to put on a clean shirt.
What?
Up swim the sea turtles, up through the ocean waves.
And then down, down swim the sea turtles, dancing on the ocean waves.
Focus, sea turtles.
Focus.
Focus, sweetie.
# Sea turtles #
# And the beluga in the deep blue sea. #
- No, not... come here.
- Yeah!
Focus!
Focus!
I am the greatest.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Billy!
Hey, what are you doing out here?
They got cake inside.
I don't care.
I don't want any cake.
Don't want... don't want any cake?
Whose son are you?
He's just a showoff, Dad.
And everybody says, "Oh, he's so cute"
just because he's little.
I hate him.
- You don't hate your brother.
- Yes, I do!
And I hate this town we have to live in.
And the kids at my school,
- they're all...
- They're just kids, Billy.
They're just kids.
Kids are the same everywhere you go.
No.
No, they aren't.
These kids are different.
Different how?
Nothing.
Billy, your, uh, your mother and I, we, uh, met this woman inside.
She has a son, Benjy, he's in your class.
You know a Benjy?
I don't know anybody.
Well, she says... she says they're all playing soccer this afternoon.
- Soccer?
- Soccer, right.
At the field by the creek.
I'll get directions from her, okay?
No, they didn't ask me.
Billy, come on, when they see how good you are, they'll be begging you to play.
Mm, I don't have my cleats.
We'll go home and get them.
Come on, now you're just making excuses.
You know, you'll go, you'll have fun.
Look here, have some cake.
It's really... stale.
- What kind is it?
- Chocolate-covered stale cake.
I can't find any.
They're all over here, come on.
Whoa, look at this one!
- He's a find.
- Let me see it.
Hey, you gotta show that one to Joe.
He's really gonna puke, huh, Joe?
Yup, he's gonna spew his guts.
What if he doesn't?
What was that, Adam?
Huh?
Well, um... worms could just be like meat really.
You know, think of the first person who said,
"I'm gonna eat a chicken."
Then he ate it and it was just a chicken.
Then we have to find out.
Someone get a worm.
- Come here.
- Me?
Don't spit it out.
Chew it.
Chew, Adam.
My God!
Whoa!
Perfect.
You see, that was one worm.
Wormboy has to eat 10.
Joe has a ring called the death ring.
If he punches you with it you die.
But you don't die now.
You die in the eighth grade, so nobody can prove it.
It's got poison in it that goes into your skin and makes an ulcer.
Very slowly, you bleed to death.
Death.
I'm running away.
Ow!
I can't run away.
Where will I go?
I've got to do it.
If we don't fight the evil forces, they'll destroy our planet.
Beat the evil forces!
Billy, I need to talk to you.
Billy, I want you to look after Woody today, all right?
Don't let him get in any trouble.
- Woody?
- Yeah, Woody.
Make sure he gets lunch, all right?
We'll be back for supper.
No, Dad, no!
Billy, you don't have a choice in the matter, okay?
I need to be fo...
focused today, okay?
So do I!
I need to be focused.
No, you don't need to be focused.
It's Saturday.
You get to do whatever you want.
Just include your brother.
Okay, listen, Wood, you're little, okay?
So you don't even know anything, okay?
So today, for the whole day you have to obey me.
You know what that means?
Be your slave?
Well, yeah, kind of.
What are you doing?
Trying to drool on those ants.
Ugh!
Listen to me, Wood.
You know how we moved here and how everything is different?
Like our house and your school.
Well, it's the same thing with me.
I'm not the same brother you had before.
I'm a whole other person.
And everything you remember about your old brother, all isn't true about your new brother.
For instance, I've never been sick.
- I've seen you sick.
- Woody.
You threw up at Raging Waters and they had to drain the whole pool.
That wasn't me!
Don't you get it?
And don't pick your nose!
What, you're gonna pick your nose all day?
You're hurting my bike!
I'm not hurting your bike.
I can't hurt a person's bike.
Well, you're shaking it and it's hitting my dilly-dink.
Don't say stuff like that.
My dilly-dink is my penis.
I'm gonna eat the worms.
Okay.
And, um... what are you doing today?
Why?
I have to babysit my little brother.
Where is he?
Get this stuff off me!
- Joey the Joke.
- Give me it, Nigel.
- Heard a story about you today, Joke.
- What story?
- Something about a worm.
- The bet, you mean?
You tell me, Joke.
Well, this new kid at our school,
I-I'm making him eat 10 worms and...
Same guy who threw a worm in your face?
- Who told you that?
- Your dumb friend, Plug.
Plug told you?
Actually he told his sister and she told me.
Said the whole school was laughing and that you were afraid.
Were you afraid, Joke, of a little worm?
I wasn't afraid.
Joke.
Joke.
You're a joke.
Get out of here, crows!
Get out of my kitchen!
Look what happens when you put them on a gummy worm.
Whoa, look at them.
They're having a spasmodic convulsion.
Hey guys, here comes Joe.
- Plug.
- Yeah.
Come here.
- What did I do?
- Ask your sister.
Benjy, how are you gonna cook them?
- With this stuff.
- What is it?
- Lard.
- Is that like butter?
Lard's from a pig.
It's the fat.
Pig fat.
Make sure you tell Wormboy that.
Yeah, look at it.
10 seems like so many.
Why did you make it 10?
Because I said I could eat 10.
But I didn't mean it.
And Joe said, "You said..."
I couldn't back out because I did say it, you know what I mean?
Not really.
Hey, Joe, there he is.
Hey, Wormboy, that's your team, huh?
You and her, and who's that little kid?
He's got training wheels.
Hey, Wormboy!
Wormboy?
Let me give you another person.
You know, help you out.
Make things fair.
Adam, go.
Wormboy!
You're gonna see stuff today, Woody, and it's just normal stuff that big kids do.
And big kids never tell their parents.
- Do you understand?
- Billy, I have to go poo.
Oh, Jeez.
I can't help it, it's making me.
- What is?
- Everything.
Woody, come with me.
Billy, go.
All right, let's go.
Pig fat was not part of the bet.
You're the one that said you liked them fried, Wormboy.
"The greasier, the slimier the better," you said.
Worm number one:
"Le Big Porker."
What are you talking like that for?
I'm French.
Go on, Wormboy.
Eat it.
Bon appetit.
Yuck, worm juice!
It squirted right on me.
Go on, Wormboy, eat it before all the guts run out.
He did it.
Oh, gross!
Ugh!
Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew.
I don't like where I'm sitting.
Look out, you guys!
I think he's gonna puke already.
Where's the worm?
- Let's see.
- I don't think it's sanitary.
You have to swallow it, Wormboy, all of it.
There's chunks in there he hasn't even chewed yet.
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Hey kids, no fires in the park without adult supervision!
Want to make a wish, Woody?
Here's what you do.
Take a little stone and go like this,
# I wish I had a horse #
# That I could ride ride ride. #
Here, now you try.
# I wish my brother was dead dead dead. #
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Hey, make sure he doesn't spit it out!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Billy!
Ugh!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Swallow!
Hey, you guys!
He ate it, Joe, look.
Yeah, I see him Benjy.
So what are we gonna do now?
We got no place to cook them.
Come on, you guys, we need somebody's kitchen.
- My family is vegetarian.
- No way.
Hey, I know, Adam Simms.
His uncle owns The Brown Toad.
My uncle hates me.
You boys know what you want?
You're taking up the whole counter there.
- Uh, we're still deciding, sir.
- Yeah.
Adam!
- Oh, hi, Uncle Ed.
- What's this?
I was just, um, giving you a hand in here.
Last time you gave me a hand you nearly chopped your thumb off.
Yuck!
Here, just wear this.
Don't muck up the works.
Adam!
Faster!
Cook faster.
Oh, no.
Ugh!
Hey hey hey!
You're gonna burn down my restaurant!
- But Uncle Ed...
- Stay back!
Stay back!
There you go.
Omelet up.
Ding ding.
Boiler Head.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
Hello, boys.
Come on over here.
Come on.
You boys up to something?
You look a little mischievous.
Do you know, that I used to come to The Brown Toad when I was a kid?
Yeah.
Oh, root beer float and a bacon burger... by golly, I was in heaven.
Alley-oop.
Mm.
Mm mm mm.
Mm, that's a good omelet.
He ate the whole worm!
The principal of our school!
"When I was a boy I ate root beer floats, by golly!"
Why did he say alley-oop?
- Yeah.
- Maybe he's nuts.
Yeah!
I am Boiler Head.
Alley-oop!
Alley-oop, alley-oop,
Alley-oop, alley-oop.
- Donny!
- Alley-oop, alley-oop...
I'm sorry.
We're just laughing, Joe.
I wasn't asking you, Wormboy.
Adam!
What's this box of bugs doing in my restaurant?
You're gonna have the health department on my case.
Get out of here!
All of you!
Punks!
Don't worry, you guys.
I cooked the worm.
I seriously cooked it.
I cooked two worms at once.
See, two of them.
Oh, cool.
How did you make it so lumpy?
I dunked it in the French fry fryer and then smeared liver juice all over it.
Liver juice?
I was trying to cover the worm taste.
Hey, you guys, I should name it.
How about "The Greasy Brown Toad
Bloater Special"?
Plug!
What's the matter, not French enough for you?
All right, go on, Wormboy.
Eat it.
Ew!
Ugh!
Why are they guarding him, Adam?
In case he throws up.
'Cause what if he wanted to cheat?
He could throw up and never tell.
So Joe made Plug and Bradley the official puke watchers.
Adam, are you positive Twitch is okay with this?
Sure.
No!
Please!
They're gonna kill...
- Tomato paste.
- And put this cheese in.
Smell it.
It smells like a person's armpit.
You guys!
You can't just steal everything.
- Are we allowed to eat a pickle?
- No.
Your dog is walking sideways, Twitch.
No no, she has arthritis.
Oh, my eyes are burning.
- No!
- What all's in there?
Louisiana Hot Sauce sauce.
So hot it'll blow a person's head off.
Bam bam bam!
No!
No!
It's ready.
The "Burning Fireball."
All right, I'll go get him.
No!
Ah!
Man.
Hey, guys, bring him in.
No!
I'm not ready yet.
I gotta go watch, 'cause this one's gonna be ugly.
Wait for me, you guys!
Erika, watch me!
Boys are so weird.
He can't even stand the smell.
Hot hot hot hot!
It's burning!
Come on, Wormboy, eat the whole thing.
Sick.
He's gonna blow!
It's over!
It's all over.
Everyone just stand back.
Stand back, you guys.
- Just open your mouth, Wormboy.
- Water!
No water!
It's a new rule.
No more cooking in my house!
The door is locked!
And... and... and I quit your team, Joe!
Who cares if you quit?
All you are is Twitch, you little loser.
Anybody else?
Huh?
Want to go on Wormboy's team?
Yeah!
Me.
Me too, Joe!
You're already on his team, Adam.
Yeah, but you made me be.
But now I want to.
That's different
- Here you go, Billy.
- Ahh!
- Turn it off, Adam!
- Turn it off!
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying.
Here, come on.
Look, Benjy, you got to do better, okay?
- I practically poisoned him.
- Then why didn't it work?
Wormboy stopped himself with mental powers.
- What?
- His mind told his vomit to stay inside of his stomach.
That's impossible.
Yeah, puke has a mind of its own.
You almost took my head off, Adam.
Here you go.
Don't...
- I'm okay.
- Hy-ah!
- I got it!
Oh!
- Hoo-ah!
Oh!
Okay, this...
- this is not going well.
- Where are you going?
- This is... this is bad.
- What?
- We're terrible.
We're terrible.
- What?
I got bad shorts.
People are staring at us.
This is bad.
Oh, that's him.
Look alive, here they come.
Here they come.
That's the guy you're afraid of?
Huh.
# I'm not the kind of guy #
# Who gives up just like that... #
# Oh no oh oh #
- # The tide is high... #
- Yup yup.
# But I'm holding on... #
- Ow!
- Honey!
We're a team, right?
- And we're gonna beat Joe Guire.
- Yeah!
And we're gonna make him come to school with worms in his pants.
- Yeah!
- And when he does...
He's gonna punch us all with the death ring and we're all gonna die like Adam Simms.
Hey, but that's not till the eighth grade, right?
Where is Adam?
- Adam?
- Oh, oh, oh.
Come on, man, go go!
Keep on going!
- No no no.
- Yeah, keep going!
- Come on!
- Come on!
Let's go!
Whoo!
Get down.
Faster!
- Faster!
- Faster!
Faster!
Whoo!
Whoo!
- Look out, Billy!
- Billy!
Hey, what's going on back there?
- Game over!
- Let's get out of here!
- Run run!
- Let's go!
Let's go!
Get out!
Get out of my store.
Are you ready?
# One little bird fell out of the nest #
# When the cat ate him up #
- # His mama said it's for the best. #
- Two bird.
# Two little bird flapped his wings and flew #
# He met an aeroplane and said, boom #
- # How do you do?
#
- It's Erika.
Hey, you guys!
Hey, you guys!
- It's Erk.
- Stop!
Joe, stop!
You're touching my bike.
Yeah yeah.
Is the bet over?
You're a girl, you don't know about the bet.
- Where's Billy?
- Erk, let go!
Look, we're going to Plug's house, okay?
His dad's got a blowtorch.
Tell me where Billy is.
We can't keep up with you guys.
Who asked you to?
I'm looking after Billy's brother.
So that's who that kid is?
He's Wormboy's little brother?
Don't talk to him, Woody.
Do you wanna know where Billy is or don't you?
Hey, Woody.
Have you ever seen your brother throw up?
He doesn't know what you're talking about, Joe.
Sure he does.
Yeah, he got sick from chicken pox, too much Halloween, and putting tooth paste on a light bulb.
And he got sick at the zoo from watching a pig lick itself!
What else did he get sick from?
Car sick.
Oh, yeah?
Mo-wo-wotion sickness.
Thanks, you little midget.
What happened to the blowtorch, Plug?
My dad just laughed at me.
Ha ha ha.
Magni-fried.
What's all this?
Crushed up marshmallow, dash of ketchup and tuna fish from a can.
I call it the "Marsh Mallieu."
How about "Barf Mallieu"?
"Barf-mellow." Thanks, Adam.
Oops.
Sorry, Billy.
The worm, the sauce.
Oh!
# Alley-oopa, gentille alley-oopa. #
I can do this.
Whoo!
Oh, yeah, I'm Wormboy!
Stomach of steel!
Ooo!
I ate the whole Barfmel...
whoa!
Oh!
Oops.
Are you okay, Billy?
- Billy, are you okay?
- "Billy, are you okay?"
Erk!
Erk!
- Billy!
- Billy, are you okay?
- Oh, Billy.
- Poor thing.
Get away, Erika.
You big giant.
Oh!
- Oh, that hurts.
- Erk!
Go on, Erika.
- You big giant!
- Erk!
- Aw!
Bye!
- Have a nice day.
Give him another one, Benjy.
Peanut butter and worm jam sandwich.
Billy the Great.
Woody!
Mommy!
Mommy!
- Oh my God!
Oh, okay, um...
- Shoot!
Chew!
Come here!
Come here, baby!
Chew it!
- Billy!
- Swallow.
Hey, there you are.
When are you coming home for supper?
Supper?
Yeah, supper.
You gonna introduce me, Billy?
How are you doing, guys?
I'm Billy's father.
- How are you doing, Mr. Forrester?
- Hey!
- Joe Guire.
- Joe Guire, nice to meet you.
You see that, Billy?
Kids do shake hands.
What have you guys been up to all day, boys?
- Playing, you know.
- Playing, yeah.
- And having fun.
- Yeah.
Great, great.
You know, it's suppertime, sir, and we all have to go home and have a nice big supper.
Don't we, Billy?
Right you are, Joe.
Tell you what, Billy, we're gonna take the Woodster with us.
He looks a little tired.
And we'll see you at home.
Bye, Mr. Forrester.
- What time is it, Bradley?
- 5:03, Joe.
This is perfect.
Gotta go home and gobble down your supper.
Don't even think about puking, 'cause you never know who's watching.
Bye.
Three whole worms to go.
See, the trick with chopsticks is to pinch them like so.
And then it's all in the wrist.
What's the matter, honey?
Aren't you hungry?
Of course he's hungry.
Out riding bikes around all day.
How many games did we play today, Helen?
One, but it went on forever.
- Mommy?
- Yes, sweetie.
What is it, honey?
Oh.
- Oh, hey, Wood.
- Poor thing.
- Woody, come on.
- Oh, honey.
- I'll give him a bath.
- Okay.
I got you, oh, baby.
Aw, little guy.
He's tuckered out, that little duffer.
Looks like you ran him ragged, didn't you?
- Dad!
- Yeah.
It's getting late and they're all going out again.
And... and...
What's going on?
I've been eating worms all day.
What?
Well, I didn't want to, but then when I started I had to keep going.
And it made me feel awful.
It's okay.
It's okay, Billy, I understand.
I do.
I've eaten a few worms myself this past week.
- You have?
- Yeah.
I'm the new guy too, remember?
Trying to fit in.
Trying to please others.
A worm here and a worm there, I know what that tastes like.
You're not talking about real worms, are you, Dad?
I'm talking about adjusting to a new situation.
You know, I saw all those boys today.
It's a lot of boys to meet all at once too, isn't it?
Yeah, well, they're not all as nice as you think they are.
Careful there, Billy.
You don't want to judge them too quickly.
Take it from me.
You... you want to give people time.
I'm not hungry at all.
Eat up, Billy.
You don't want to go outside on an empty stomach.
Move!
Billy.
What are you guys doing?
Time's running out.
And Joe wants everybody to meet him down by the river.
Why the river?
There's an old lady that lives down there.
People say she's a witch.
She sells worms to fishermen.
Huge ones, long as a person's arm.
Don't tell him that, Adam.
I-I-I meant, long as a cat's arm.
Where's Twitch?
Grounded 'cause we wrecked his house, and destroyed it.
I can't eat anymore worms, you guys!
I'm gonna quit.
You can't quit.
If you quit then you lose.
Then we all lose.
This is our one chance not to be losers!
- Woody!
- # When the cat ate him up #
# His mama said it's for the best. #
- Where did you learn that song?
- Erika.
Erika.
She'll know how to get me out of this stupid dumb bet.
What are you thinking of her for?
She's a girl!
And, Billy, you called her a big fat giant, remember?
- I didn't say fat.
- Yeah, but still.
Erika would never be mad at me.
We're friends.
- Rat!
- No wait, you don't get it.
Don't get what?
That you're just turning into another Joe?
- I'm not a Joe.
- You were being mean like him.
And you're acting like some person that you're not.
I'm sorry.
I wasn't being mean on purpose.
You try eating worms with marshmallows and ketchup on them.
Joe Guire is cruel to people, Billy, and it's all 'cause people let him.
They just do what he says and he goes around making rules up.
And you're the first person that ever did anything.
- What did I do?
- You challenged him!
- Well, I wish I never did.
- And so will he when this is over.
Joe Guire is a bully.
Make him come to school with worms in his pants and no one will ever be scared of him again.
What about the death ring though?
It's just a dumb old ring he wears to scare people, Billy.
Win this bet and that ring will mean nothing.
I've never been in there before.
- Have you, Joe?
- No.
But my brother went in there once, he just saw fishing stuff.
It was really gross and spooky inside.
You think Wormboy is gonna show?
If he doesn't...
I win the bet.
There she is.
Some people call her the two-headed witch.
You know why?
She had two heads once, but one fell off.
The one that fell off is in that bag she carries around all the time.
Donny, what's that noise?
It's Benjy.
Benjy!
Benjy!
Ssh!
She's not very friendly looking.
I wonder what her other head looks like.
Ssh.
"Gone to catch me some supper."
Plug, try the door.
Why me?
Just do it, okay?
Oh, it's stinky!
Oh, gross.
Interesting.
They've got dead fish corpses hanging from the ceiling.
What do you mean, dead fish corpses?
That's not funny!
What are you laughing at, Bradley?
Nothing.
It's just that you seemed kind of...
Scared!
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm just scared for you, Wormboy, that's all.
'Cause there's big giant night crawlers in there.
From Canada, my brother said.
Which means they're gigantic.
We better get started then.
What time is it, Bradley?
You don't ask Bradley what time it is.
He's on my team.
Whatever you say, Joe.
You make the rules.
- 6:35, Joe.
- Yeah, okay.
Hey you guys, guess what I found?
Green ones!
Who's got $2?
How about that for technology?
It's like buying a Coke.
Wait, what are these cups for?
- Plug?
- Yeah.
If Joe loses the bet, you think he'll really walk through our school with worms in his pants?
We can't let him lose the bet.
We're on his team.
Yeah.
But sometimes I wish I wasn't on his team.
Like back at The Brown Toad, when he yelled at me,
I wanted to quit his team!
Then why didn't you?
I'm not brave, I guess.
Ugh, they really are green.
Green goes with green.
Spinach from a can, crown of broccoli.
"Viola!"
You got a worm, Bradley?
It just went to the bathroom on my hand.
Ugh.
The "Green Slusher" served in a bed of slush at room temperature.
Bring it on.
Ugh!
You made it too thick, Benjy.
Looks like wasabi.
Canadian night crawlers.
There's something I've always wanted to try.
I'm naming this one
"Radioactive Slime Delight."
I wonder what he's thinking about.
Perfect.
There you go, Wormboy.
You might need this.
Who's that trespassing in my bait shop?
- I'm getting out of here.
- Watch out!
- Come on, let's go.
What are you doing?
- A bet's a bet!
What?
What are you doing in here?
Get out of here!
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of the way of the head!
I think she went inside.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
Let's go.
Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go!
Wait!
Wait, you guys!
Hey you guys, wait!
Wait up!
Wait up!
Wait up!
Wait for me.
She was right there.
Right there!
She hit me in the head...
with her head.
You didn't throw up, did you?
What are you doing here, Twitch?
I'm on your team, Billy.
One worm to go.
What time is it, Bradley?
- 6:52, Joe.
- What's going on?
They're digging for worms, Joe.
Yeah, but they won't find any here anyway.
We will too!
Time's running out, Wormboy.
- Two minutes, Joe.
- We'll never make it.
There aren't any worms around here anywhere.
- There's got to be!
- There's not, Billy!
We're gonna lose.
We'll never find a worm.
We might as well just...
- A worm!
- Eat it, Billy!
Come on, eat it!
Make Joe come to school with worms in his pants!
- No!
- Move!
No!
That's not fair.
You're a cheater.
Go, Billy!
Go Billy!
Go!
39 seconds.
Go go go go!
Get it!
Get it!
Yeah!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
Billy!
10 seconds!
Nine, eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two...
Boys are so weird!
Hey, Joke.
Now you really are a joke.
Wha... what are you doing here, Nige?
I came all the way here to see you win.
Now the whole school's gonna be laughing at you.
They're gonna be laughing at me too 'cause I'm your brother.
Leave him alone.
I think you might want to stay out of this.
Leave him alone.
Yeah, leave him alone.
Bunch of little worms.
You won.
Shake on it.
Kids don't shake hands.
Shake.
Two sock...
yes, got it.
Got it.
- Week number two, Billy.
- Yeah.
Last Monday seems like a long time ago.
What's the headline?
Cheating.
- Cheating?
- Yeah.
If you cheat at something and you win, and nobody knows you cheated, do you still win?
The only way to win is by playing fair.
But what if you didn't even know you cheated.
Then would it be okay?
Sounds to me like you already know the answer, Billy.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Billy.
Bye, Wormboy.
See you later, Wood.
- I didn't win.
- Yeah, you did, Billy.
You ate all 10 worms.
I only ate nine.
Then how come we counted 10?
The 10th one was eaten by Boiler Head.
The omelet.
What are we gonna do?
Oh!
Hey, there's Joe!
Oh, there he is!
Look, it's Billy!
What's he doing?
Ew!
No way!

She's in ecstasy all right.
Her head is thrown back, her mouth open.
Her heavy-lidded eyes are half-closed.
An angelic hand is delicately uncovering her breast.
You have to look.
You don't know where to look.
A century after Bernini created this sculpture, a French art lover, doing the tour of Rome, came into this church, peered at the spectacle and said,
"Well, if that's divine love, I know all about it. "
So, what is this?
Surely not an erotic trance, not from the most devout sculptor in Rome.
No one who was the bosom friend of popes, a pillar of the Catholic establishment, could possibly want us to see a nun in the throes of orgasm,
could he?
It's no good pretending that ecstasy isn't a physical as well as a spiritual experience.
That passion doesn't work through the body as well as the soul.
Bernini knew all about passion.
That's what his art was about.
It was this physical intensity that would transform sculpture.
No one before Bernini had managed to make marble so carnal.
In his nimble hands, it would flutter and stream, quiver and sweat.
His figures weep and shout, their torsos twist and run and arch themselves in spasms of intense sensation.
He could, like an alchemist, change one material into another.
Marble into trees, leaves, hair and, of course, flesh.
The whole point of classical sculpture was to make humans less so, to give mortal flesh the heavyweight smoothness of immortality.
So many of them end up looking divine, but bloodless.
But then, along comes Bernini, and suddenly even Michelangelo's David looks immobile beside Bernini's whirling, twisting tornado.
If sculpture was supposed to convey gravity, Bernini would defy it.
His figures break loose from their plinths, flying away into space.
For as long as anyone could remember,
Gian Lorenzo Bernini had startled the people who mattered.
that prompted the astonished Pope to tip the little boy as the next Michelangelo.
His father, Pietro, was a sculptor from Florence.
Seldom better than competent and sometimes worse.
But in his son, he knew a good thing when he saw it.
"Watch out, Signor Bernini," an admiring cardinal said,
"The boy will surpass his master."
So, fast out of the starting blocks, our little prodigy.
Here's a playful tour de force.
Two little angels embrace in wide-eyed innocence.
Bernini did this in his teens.
He kept it on display on the landing of his house throughout his life.
And this is his goat, Amalthea, and the infant Jupiter.
A standard bit of mythology transformed into a romp with the shaggiest nanny goat in sculpture.
What makes these little figures burst from their dull, mythological subject matter?
They have the hot breath of life in them, lusty, mischievous, nursery school naughtiness.
Bernini arrived in Rome in 1605.
Just at the time that Caravaggio's punchy street dramas were electrifying the Church,
giving it a new vision of how to move the flock.
No more remote saints.
Instead, the shock theatre of the earthy passions.
Salvation in the guts.
So how do you top Caravaggio?
Answer: you can't, but in sculpture.
This is St Lawrence being barbecued alive for his Christian beliefs.
Bernini was 16 when he did this.
He's trying to catch the moment of transcendent pain when, if we believe the legends, St Lawrence turns to his executioners and says, in a moment of macabre drollery, "Right, turn me over, boys, this side's done. "
No wonder he became the patron saint of cooks.
But there's something serious going on here.
As Lawrence's hand touches the flame, a mysterious transformation takes place.
The chroniclers said the smell of scorched flesh turned fragrant.
Pain and sweetness become one.
Torment becomes ecstasy.
A rehearsal, perhaps, for a sweet ordeal to come.
He loved playing with fire, did Bernini.
Couldn't stop himself.
Here he is as a damned soul.
It's a self-portrait.
Bernini has scorched his own arm in a naked flame, screaming in a mirror to get the expression just right.
An extremist for his art, then, but also, perhaps, someone capable of impulsive acts of violence.
Still, it's a drama of the flesh no one, not even Michelangelo, had made quite so gripping.
It was enough to make one bigwig on the Roman scene,
Cardinal Scipione Borghese, want to adopt Gian Lorenzo as his personal star property.
Someone who'd make his fabulous new villa, up here on the Pincian Hill, the place to see great art.
How the other red hats would gnash their teeth in envy.
There was something larger than life about Scipione Borghese.
The bull-like neck and head sat atop a jumbo body.
Sly Bernini, using a button that can't quite make it through its hole to give us a feeling for the flesh tight-packed into the satin.
The holy man of the Church is, above all, a physical presence.
He looks more like a chef than His Eminence.
What he was after, Bernini said, was a speaking likeness, because he thought that people gave themselves away most characteristically either just before or after they spoke.
So he works his magic on Scipione.
The little fringe poking out from the Cardinal's hat, the chipmunk cheeks, the fleshy, blubbery lips.
Scipione's nose catching the light in such a way as to suggest a film of sweat.
The natural effusion of a big man in a hot city.
Rome, the holy metropolis, buzzing with worldly ambition.
For the church aristocracy, it's not just the money you've got that counts.
It's also the art.
Painters, sculptors and architects are angling for patrons, and the Rothschilds and the Saatchis of their day, the popes and cardinals, are gambling on the next prize genius.
Bernini, of course, has everything it takes to succeed.
He's witty, charming, extremely well-connected, frighteningly cultured, ferociously disciplined, always delivers when he says he will and he doesn't drink.
In other words, the opposite of Caravaggio.
And how do we know all this?
Well, someone had noted Bernini's every move.
Filippo Baldinucci, minor painter, gossip and art critic.
Not that important in himself, but someone who'd collected everything he could from those who knew Bernini, and turned it into his first proper biography.
This is Apollo and Daphne.
It's a story of sexual hunting.
Apollo wants the nymph, Daphne.
She definitely doesn't want him.
He runs after her, and just as he's about to grab her, the gods answer her prayers by turning her into a laurel tree.
It's all-action sculpture.
Apollo breaking his breathless run, his cape and his hair still flying in the wind.
Daphne, who's cornered, isn't rooted to the spot, except botanically, and seems to be climbing into the air,
her mouth open wide in a scream.
Hair and fingers already metamorphosing into leafy twigs.
But the tease of the drama is the silky nude that Bernini's made available to us exactly as she disappears inside her protective casing of tree bark.
A painfully thwarted consummation.
It's not just me.
A French cardinal said he wouldn't have it in his house because such a beautiful nude would be sure to arouse anybody who saw it.
Bernini is said to have been really pleased when he heard that.
Bernini is in his early 20s, a superstar.
Someone on whom the mighty and the powerful almost fawn.
One pope, Gregory XV, makes him a knight, so Bernini is known ever after as the Cavaliere.
The next pope, Urban VIII, makes him his best friend.
There's a story that when Cardinal Barberini became Pope Urban VIII, he called Bernini into his apartment and said...
Bernini is Rome's supreme virtuoso.
The emperor of the arts, and not just in sculpture.
He's also a painter, a master builder and a playwright.
And he has everything, charisma, swarthy good looks, money, status and enemies.
This is Francesco Borromini, taciturn, neurotic, introverted, depressive.
A man of absolutely no social graces whatsoever.
For good and for ill,
Borromini would play a pivotal role in Bernini's life.
The two of them would trip over each other's ambitions, spur each other on to ever-greater heights, ever-greater risks.
Borromini was a brilliant architect.
He made walls and balconies curve and bulge where they had no right to.
Ceilings that sing and throb.
Here he is exaggerating perspective.
Making the columns at the back much smaller than they should be in order to make the space much deeper than it really is.
It's all eye wizardry.
If two men were responsible for creating the look of baroque Rome, for making Rome Rome, those two men were Borromini and Bernini.
And they hated each other.
At first, it was a one-way rivalry.
Borromini resented Bernini's popularity, his hogging of the limelight.
It's a bit like Mozart and Salieri.
Only there's no Salieri here, no weaker talent.
They're both geniuses.
Look at these two churches, just 200 yards away from each other, in Rome.
One by Bernini, the other by Borromini.
Here's the Borromini church, San Carlo delle Quattro Fontane.
It's the work of an architect chess master, pure and austere.
Just brick and stucco, no colour or sculpture allowed.
Just mind-blowing designs, worked out from the higher geometry.
The heavenly order of shapes and numbers.
Now, here's the Bernini church.
Loads of colour trowelled on, as if it were a stage set with full theatrical lighting.
It's all look-at-me razzle-dazzle.
Showy, visceral and sexy, just like him.
The rivalry between Bernini and Borromini started in earnest in 1624, when someone had to be appointed the new architect for Saint Peter's,
and get to build the baldachino, the enormous canopy over the tomb of Saint Peter, located directly under Michelangelo's great dome.
It's the plummiest job in town.
Now, at this stage, Borromini was far more qualified than Bernini.
He'd trained as an architect and was the obvious candidate for the job.
But guess who got it?
Mr Charming, Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
"What, the biggest job in Rome?
And he gives it to him, and not me, just because he's the Pope's best friend?"
"I mean, the man knows damn all about buildings."
Borromini must have been furious.
Of course, the engineering problems of forging the great canopy, raising this twisty gilt-bronze monster, were a serious stretch for Bernini's competence.
So, wisely, he gets help.
He turns to Borromini, who had no choice but to help.
It was for the greater good of the Church, after all.
Architecture has always been a collaborative exercise, so it's not surprising to find that virtually all the drawings for the baldachino are by Borromini.
Does he get the credit he deserves?
Does he hell.
And that, Francesco Borromini neither forgives nor forgets.
It's an unappealing trait, this ungenerous instinct for monopolising the glory.
And it will come back to bite Bernini.
It's not just Borromini who feels it.
The assistant who did that fine leaf-work on Daphne's leaves was so angry at not getting his due that he walked out of the project in a rage.
But then the Cavaliere Bernini always did have a cavalier way with his assistants.
His own mother complained.
So he took what he needed.
Technical expertise, grinding toil and, in the case of one of his assistants,
Matteo Buonarelli, his wife.
Her name is Costanza.
Constance.
Did she and Bernini have a laugh in bed about that?
Here she is, in 1637, at the height of their affair.
You can see he can't get enough of her.
And from the intensity of all this brimming desire comes an entirely new kind of European sculpture.
Before Costanza, busts had been entirely respectable, and they were usually reserved for tombs.
Only the Romans, a long time before, had used sculpture for informal portraits.
But informal doesn't quite do it for Costanza, does it?
How about intimate?
For this is a portrait of a woman whose passion is written on her face and her body.
Whose flaring temper just adds fuel to her lover's fire.
This is what we mean by lovingly carved.
It's as though Bernini was reliving his caresses with his chisel.
The falling away of the blouse, perhaps the single, sexiest invitation in all European sculpture.
There's something else unique about this sculpture.
It's the celebration of a spitfire.
Costanza Buonarelli may have been the wife of a lowly assistant sculptor, but she came from a proud, old family, the Piccolomini.
So her jaw is firm, the rosebud mouth is in the act of speaking, and not deferentially.
Everything that was supposed to define womanhood, demure, chaste serenity, is junked for Costanza.
She's a wild thing, and the sculptor is hooked on her temper.
But it's not Costanza's temper that would end up undoing Bernini.
It was his own.
Despite all the genteel charm, Bernini was known to have a low boiling point.
Underneath all those social graces was the bloodthirsty temper of a Neapolitan gangster.
And in one unbelievably shocking episode, he lets it rip.
It started with a rumour.
Costanza, it's whispered, was not so constant after all.
Seems she has a thing about the Bernini boys, since she's sleeping not just with Gian Lorenzo, but with his younger brother, Luigi.
Oh, it's hard to believe, I know, that anyone would want to get their hands on anyone except Mr Fabulous himself.
But could the rumours be true?
The trap is set that evening.
Gian Lorenzo says breezily how he has to go off to the country the next day, so he won't be in town.
But he doesn't go into the country, does he?
Instead, early next morning, he goes to Costanza's house and waits.
Luigi emerges.
So does Costanza.
That swelling breast Bernini had lovingly carved flattened against Luigi's chest in a passionate embrace.
There's a chase through the streets, across the piazzas, over the bridges, right into Saint Peter's itself.
Where its official architect does his best to murder his own brother.
Gian Lorenzo grabs an iron bar and smashes it against Luigi's body, breaking two ribs.
He's famous as a miracle worker.
This time the miracle is that he hasn't killed his own brother.
It takes a message from their mother to the papal cops to separate them.
And that's not the end of it.
That afternoon, Gian Lorenzo sends a servant to Costanza's house.
He doesn't cut her throat.
Instead, he slashes her perfect face to ribbons.
So the man who has cut stone to create beauty has cut flesh to destroy it.
And what do you suppose is Bernini's punishment for grievous bodily harm and attempted murder?
Oh, a really stiff sentence, a 3,000 scudi fine.
Except that his pal, the Pope, waives it.
"Naughty, naughty," says the Pope, "This mustn't happen again.
"So I sentence you to be married."
"And, by the way, she just happens to be the most beautiful girl in Rome."
"That should keep you out of mischief." Papal wink, papal nudge.
So Bernini is married off to Caterina Tezio, daughter of a Roman lawyer.
For his part in the fight, brother Luigi is banished to Bologna.
Everyone else goes to jail.
The servant who did the razor job and, insult added to injury, Costanza herself, convicted of fornication and adultery.
And what happened to the bust?
Well, Bernini's new wife wouldn't have it in the house.
Which is just as well, since Gian Lorenzo couldn't bear to look at it, either.
He might, I suppose, have smashed it.
But luckily, a Medici buyer from Florence snapped it up.
Which is why we're looking at it here in the Bargello Museum in Florence.
The Costanza that once was, and, for us, always will be.
And you're thinking, "I don't care how good his sculpture is.
"I don't care how important his art is."
"What an absolute bastard!"
"Please tell me he doesn't get off scot-free."
Well, strangely enough, it's exactly from this moment of the crime against Costanza that things go swiftly downhill for the Cavaliere Untouchable.
And it all went wrong in the place that mattered most for Bernini.
The place that made or broke artists and architects.
The Cathedral of Saint Peter's.
This is the facade of Saint Peter's we all know, but the aggressively confident 17th century popes didn't want to stop with this.
They wanted two great bell towers at each corner, above where we now see the clocks.
It was those bells, after all, that would summon the faithful for papal blessings and make the Christian dream real.
But in the middle, of course, was Michelangelo's great dome.
So the first designs for the towers made them respectfully low.
Safe, squat, one-storey affairs.
The along comes Bernini, constitutionally incapable of deference.
"My towers are going to be taller than your dome", he says.
Three storeys tall, in fact.
Almost 70 metres above the original pedestals, six times heavier than the original towers.
Problem was, though, Bernini's towers were about to be built on swampy ground.
It's not that Bernini didn't know about this before he got started.
It's just that he's surrounded by yes men who tell him what he wants to hear.
That building tall towers on dodgy ground is no real problem.
What he needs are brutally honest advisors who aren't afraid of spelling out the risks he's taking.
There was one person who knew that building a tall, heavy tower on unstable foundations was asking for trouble.
That person was Borromini.
But it seemed to be beneath Bernini's dignity to ask his rival for advice.
So, without the benefit of Borromini's criticism,
Bernini sails straight into disaster.
In July, 1641, Bernini unveiled his first tower to the public.
Two months later, cracks start to appear.
Bernini takes to his bed.
Won't eat.
Gets so ill, he's reported near death.
It gets worse.
The cracks aren't just in the foundation of the bell tower.
They've spread to the facade of the main church itself.
Then, in 1644, disaster.
Pope Urban VIII, Bernini's friend and the staunchest supporter of the bell tower, dies.
There's a new pope, Innocent X, and he sees it as his job to get rid of all the old favourites, like Bernini.
After all, he has a new favourite, Francesco Borromini.
So, after 15 years in Bernini's shadow,
Borromini's moment for revenge has at last arrived.
An inquiry is set up to deal with Bernini's towers.
Borromini submits detailed evidence, a lovingly-rendered drawing of Bernini's disaster.
"Well, what do you expect?" says Borromini.
"The tower's too tall.
It's too heavy for its base supports."
"It's too unwieldy.
It's built recklessly on swampy ground."
"It's amazing, actually, it hasn't collapsed already."
"It's all very well going digging beneath the tower after the event to see how serious the damage is."
"If he'd have asked me, since I know a bit about building,
I would've told him.
But he didn't."
On the 23rd of February, 1646, a meeting was held at the Vatican to discuss the fate of Bernini's south tower.
But the Pope had already made his decision.
Demolish it.
The demolition takes 11 months.
If Bernini had been anywhere near Saint Peter's, he would've seen it and heard it.
The winches, the pulleys, the columns stacked on the roof.
Down came the bell tower, and down with it came Gian Lorenzo Bernini from the height of fame and reputation to something like a laughing stock.
It's 1648.
Bernini is 50, old by the standards of the time.
So how did he survive the humiliation?
One visiting English student has him collapsing into despair.
Others have him buckling down to work.
He still does get commissions, but not from the biggest hitters in Rome, not any more.
It would take a miracle now for him to redeem himself.
And then that miracle arrived.
A moment of mind-boggling drama.
A moment that wavers between mystery and indecency.
The body of a saint penetrated.
The arrow withdrawn from its passage, poised to strike again.
Her pain indistinguishable from pleasure.
The gasping woman levitating, defying gravity on rippling cushions of stone.
So, who was it then that gave Bernini the chance to portray a saint in a way no one else had ever dared?
You can't imagine a more respectable patron than Cardinal Federico Cornaro, who came from an old aristocratic clan that wanted to build a family chapel in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria.
He would have known about Saint Teresa of Ávila.
Everyone did.
She died in her native Spain in 1582.
But there was something, many things, actually, which made Teresa an awkward fit for sainthood.
Not least her levitations.
A rapture came over me so suddenly, it almost lifted me out of myself.
I heard these words,
"Now, I want you to speak not with men, but with angels. "
It's not surprising, then, that of all the modern saints, it was Teresa who still had no chapel devoted to her.
The Cornaro dynasty, who were patrons of her austere order of nuns, the Barefoot Carmelites, jumped in and presented Bernini with the biggest challenge of his career, but also the chance for a spectacular comeback.
It was the most daring drama of the body that he, or any other sculptor in the history of art, had ever conceived, much less executed.
Bernini would certainly have known about Saint Teresa.
Her autobiography was a bestseller in Catholic Rome.
Like everyone else, he would've been startled by the earthy directness of her story.
But above all, he would have been electrified by those moments in which Teresa, in the most graphic words imaginable, describes what happens to her.
Very close to me, an angel appeared in human form.
In his hands I saw a large golden spear.
And at its iron tip, there seemed to be a point of fire.
I felt as if he plunged this into my heart several times, so that it penetrated all the way to my entrails.
When he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out with it, and it left me totally inflamed with a great love for God.
The pain was so severe that it made me moan several times.
Now, if there was one thing that Bernini was not, it was crude.
He understood perfectly well that when Teresa wrote of her raptures, she meant the longing of her soul for a consummated union with God.
It was the way she wrote about it that made it seem as if her soul and her body were the same thing.
All of Bernini's greatest body dramas had featured figures twisting in ascent.
Proserpina's flight from Pluto.
Daphne rising to the sky as if to escape stony doom.
Now it was time for him to make Teresa levitate.
This time, not in escape from penetration, but in craving for it.
It was time to forget about euphemisms.
The only way that Bernini could possibly communicate the flood of her sensation was to make visible what he knew of bodily ecstasy.
The face of a woman at the height of sexual euphoria.
It's as if he's turning his own intimate knowledge of carnal sin into carnal blessing.
So, of course, this isn't the real Teresa, middle-aged nun, rising up her cell wall with sisters hanging on to her habit.
No, this woman is unforgettably beautiful.
A match for the exquisite seraph angel lover.
They are, in their way, a couple.
Smiley face is pointing his arrow not at her breast at all, but rather lower down the torso.
But how to make visible both their union and the tide of engulfing feeling washing through Teresa?
And here Bernini has the crucial insight of the whole piece.
He turns her body inside out, so that her covering, her habit, the symbol of chastity and containment, becomes a representation of what's going on inside her.
It's the accomplice of her helpless dissolution into a liquid bliss.
It is, in fact, the climax itself.
A storm surge of churning sensation, cresting and falling as if the marble had been molten.
And these billows pour themselves from the smiling angel directly into Teresa's robe, where they join an ocean of heaving waves that folds into hollows and crevices, like surf breaking on a shore.
There's nothing furtive about any of this.
Bernini wants us to look and look hard.
So much, that he surrounds the performance with an audience, members of the Cornaro family.
Some watching the show, some chatting about what it might mean.
There's every kind of show lighting, fake sun beams, hidden lights at the back.
And, as Teresa climbs to her heights, the earth really does move.
Look down here.
The ground is opening and out pop the dead.
Everything is shaking and quaking, even the columns of the little chapel.
And here, Bernini adds the coup de grâce to all those critics who said he couldn't do architecture.
Not least Borromini, who specialised in weird, counter-intuitive bulges and curves.
"Right," said Bernini, "I'll build you a temple that not just curves and bulges,
"but actually explodes through its columns
"from the sheer uncontainable force of the drama going on inside."
The most ambitious thing he'd ever attempted, the bell tower of Saint Peter's, had come crashing down in ignominious failure.
Now, it was time for Teresa to rise up, and carry with her the resurrected reputation of the disgraced Cavaliere Bernini.
And you feel him, when he's done, standing back and saying, "Right, top that".
No one ever could.
The Cornaro loved their chapel.
12,000 scudi, no problem, worth every scudo.
Word got round.
The dazzler was back.
Even the sour, old Pope Innocent X began to sweeten on Bernini, as Borromini skulked unhappily through the Vatican corridors.
It's not that Borromini never gets commissions from the Pope again, it's just that it was Bernini who triumphed.
So wherever you go in Rome now, you're really in the Cavaliere's city.
As you approach Saint Peter's over the Ponte Sant'Angelo, you're in the company of Bernini's angels.
And even though he was denied his bell towers at Saint Peter's, he did something much better.
The colonnades which lead us towards the great church, its arms gathering believers to the bosom of the faith.
Inside the church, past the baldachino, you're drawn towards Bernini's great light.
The Holy Spirit at the seat of Saint Peter.
Popes came and went, but Bernini endured.
He gave up sinning, became a model Christian, fathered 11 children.
Never strayed again, they said.
And we're told that when he was troubled, he'd be found at the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, praying before his shrine to Saint Teresa.
And what of the others in this story?
Costanza with the cut-up face eventually got out of jail with the help of her long-suffering husband.
Borromini went on to become the great master builder of ever more eccentric and brilliant churches.
But in the end, he never really felt he got true recognition and he never got over Bernini's comeback.
Eaten up by jealousy and disappointment, he ended up by committing suicide.
And what of brother Luigi?
Well, he returned to Rome after his exile and, deep into his 60s, he was at it again.
This time caught in flagrante delicto in, guess where?
The precincts of the holy church of Saint Peter's.
Where, according to court records, he was arrested for acts of violent sodomy.
To clear the family name and secure a papal pardon for his brother,
Bernini created this, the Blessed Ludovica Albertoni.
For me, though, none of those grandstanding jobs in Rome come close to the one work he called,
"The least bad thing I ever did. "
Why?
Because he's managed to make visible, tangible, actually, something we all, if we're honest, know we hunger for, but before which we're properly tongue-tied.
Something which has produced more bad writing, more excruciating poems than anything else you can think of.
No wonder, when art historians look at this, they tie themselves in knots to avoid saying the obvious.
That we're looking at the most intense, convulsive drama of the body that any of us experience between birth and death.
Which is not to say that what we're looking at is just a spasm of erotic chemistry.
It's precisely because it isn't just that.
Because it is somehow a fusion of physical craving and, choose your word, spiritual or emotional transcendence, that Bernini's Ecstasy of Saint Teresa is a sculpture that possesses the beholder completely, the longer we stare.
So, perhaps, when that 18th-century French connoisseur looked at Teresa and said,
"If that's divine love, I know it well', he wasn't making a sly joke at all, but doffing his hat to Bernini for using the power of art to make the most difficult, the most desirable thing in the world.;
the visualisation of pure bliss.
Look, our whole lives we've been searching for this demon.
We finally know where this demon's gonna be and now we know how to kill him.
This ends now.
I'm ending it.
I don't care what it takes.
-A vision.
-Visions or no visions, the fact is the demon is coming tonight.
And this family's gonna go through the same hell we went through.
We know you have the gun, John.
-You just declared war.
-l'll bring you the Colt.
The demon is coming.
That gun is all we got.
Hand Meg a fake gun, hope she doesn't notice?
I've been waiting a long time for this fight.
Nobody's dying tonight.
Not us, not that family.
-Why don't you hand over the gun?
-Maybe I'll just shoot you.
There's more where l came from.
It's coming.
I can't believe you just shot me!
It's a fake.
-Sam, no.
-Let me go.
It's still in there.
It's suicide.
-l don't care.
-l do.
That thing killed Jess.
That thing killed Mom.
They're gone.
And they're never coming back.
Don't you say that.
Not after all this.
You boys really screwed up this time.
Where is he?
You're never gonna see your father again.
-They've got Dad.
-Meg?
-What'd she say?
-l just told you, Sammy.
Okay.
-What are you doing, Dean?
-We gotta go.
-Why?
-The demon knows we're in Salvation.
It knows we've got the Colt.
-lt's got Dad. lt's coming for us.
-Good.
We've got three bullets left.
Listen, we're not ready.
We don't know how many of them are out there.
Now, we're no good to anybody dead.
We're leaving.
Now.
-l'm telling you, we could've taken them.
-What we need is a plan.
They're probably keeping Dad alive.
Just gotta figure out where.
They'll wanna trade him for the gun.
-What?
-Dean, if that were true why didn't Meg mention a trade?
-Dad, he might be--
-Don't.
Look, I don't wanna believe it any more than you but if he is, all the more reason to kill this damn thing.
We still have the Colt.
We can finish the job.
Screw the job, Sam.
I'm just trying to do what he'd want.
He would want us to keep going.
Quit talking about him like he's dead.
Listen to me, everything stops until we get him back.
Do you understand me?
Everything.
-
- So how do we find him?
- We go to Lincoln.
Start at the warehouse where he was taken.
Come on.
You really think these demons are gonna leave a trail?
You're right.
We need help.
Here you go.
-What is this, holy water?
-That one is.
This is whiskey.
Bobby, thanks.
Thanks for everything.
-l wasn't sure if we should come.
-Nonsense.
Your daddy needs help.
Yeah, but last time we saw you, I mean, you did threaten to blast him.
You cocked the shotgun and everything.
Yeah, well, what can I say?
-John just has that effect on people.
-Yeah, I guess he does.
None of that matters now.
All that matters is that you get him back.
Bobby, this book....
-l've never seen anything like it.
-Key of Solomon?
It's the real deal, all right.
And these-
- These protective circles, they really work?
Hell, yeah.
You get a demon in one, they're trapped.
Powerless.
It's like a satanic roach motel.
Man knows his stuff.
I'll tell you something else too.
This is some serious crap you boys stepped in.
Oh, yeah?
-How's that?
-Normal year, I hear of say, three demonic possessions.
-Maybe four, tops.
-Yeah?
This year, I heard of 27 so far.
You get what I'm saying?
More and more demons are walking among us.
-A lot more.
-Do you know why?
No, but I know it's something big.
Storm's coming.
And you boys and your daddy you are smack in the middle of it.
Rumsfeld.
What is it?
Something's wrong.
No more crap, okay?
I want the Colt, Sam.
The real Colt.
Right now.
-We don't have it on us.
We buried it.
-Didn't I say, "No more crap"?
I swear, after everything I heard about you Winchesters I gotta tell you, I'm a little underwhelmed.
First Johnny tries to pawn off a fake gun and then he leaves the real gun with you two chuckleheads.
Lackluster, man.
I mean, did you really think I wouldn't find you?
Actually, we were counting on it.
Gotcha.
You know, if you wanted to tie me up, all you had to do was ask.
I salted the doors and windows.
If there are any demons out there, they ain't getting in.
-Where's our father, Meg?
-You didn't ask very nice.
Where's our father, bitch?
Jeez, you kiss your mother with that mouth?
-Oh, I forgot.
You don't.
-Hey, you think this is a frigging game?
-Where is he?
What did you do to him?
-He died screaming.
I killed him myself.
That's kind of a turn on, you hitting a girl.
You're no girl.
Dean.
-You okay?
-She's lying.
He's not dead.
Dean, you gotta be careful with her.
Don't hurt her.
-Why?
-Because she really is a girl, that's why.
-What are you talking about?
-She's possessed.
That's a human possessed by a demon.
Can't you tell?
You trying to tell me there's an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there?
That's actually good news.
You gonna read me a story?
Something like that.
Hit it, Sam.
An exorcism?
Are you serious?
We're going for it, baby.
Head spinning, projectile vomiting, the whole nine yards.
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna rip the bones from your body.
No, you're gonna burn in hell.
Unless you tell us where our dad is.
Well, at least you'll get a nice tan.
He begged for his life with tears in his eyes.
He begged to see his sons one last time.
That's when I slit his throat.
For your sake, I hope you're lying.
Because if it's true, I swear to God I will march into hell myself and I will slaughter each and every one of you evil sons of bitches, so help me, God.
Where is he?
-You just won't take dead for an answer.
-Where is he?
-Dead.
-No, he's not!
He's not dead.
He can't be!
What are you looking at?
Keep reading.
-He will be!
-Wait!
What?
He's not dead.
But he will be after what we do to him.
-How do we know you're telling the truth?
-You don't.
-Sam--!
-A building, okay?
-A building in Jefferson City.
-Missouri?
Where, where?
An address.
-l don't know.
-And the demon.
Where is it?
I don't know. I swear.
That's everything.
That's all I know.
-Finish it.
-What?
-l told you the truth!
-l don't care.
-You son of a bitch, you promised.
-l lied!
Sam.
Sam!
Read.
Maybe we can still use her.
Find out where the demon is.
-She doesn't know.
-She lied!
Sam, there's an innocent girl trapped in there and we've gotta help her.
-You're gonna kill her.
-What?
You said she fell from a building.
That girl's body is broken.
The only thing keeping her alive is that demon inside.
You exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.
We are not gonna leave her like that.
-She is a human being.
-We're gonna put her out of her misery.
Sam, finish it.
Finish it.
She's still alive.
Call 911.
Get some water and blankets.
-Thank you.
-Just take it easy, all right?
Come on, let's-
- Let's get her down.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
I gotcha.
Gotcha.
It's okay.
It's okay.
-A year.
-What?
-lt's been a year.
-Just take it easy.
I've been awake for some of it.
I couldn't move my own body.
And things looked-
- It--
It's a nightmare.
-Was it telling the truth about our dad?
-Dean.
-We need to know.
-Yes.
But it wants you to know.
They want you to come for him.
If Dad's still alive, none of that matters.
Where is the demon we're looking for?
Not there.
Other ones.
Awful ones.
Where are they keeping our dad?
By the riv-
- River.
-Sunrise.
-Sunrise?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You better hurry up and beat it before the paramedics get here.
What are you gonna tell them?
You think you guys invented lying to the cops?
I'll figure something out.
Here, take this.
-You might need it.
-Thanks.
Thanks for everything.
-Be careful, all right?
-You just go find your dad.
And when you do, you bring him around, would you?
I won't even try to shoot him this time.
You've been quiet.
Just getting ready.
He's gonna be fine, Dean.
Dude, what are you drawing on my car?
It's called a devil's trap.
-Demons can't get through it or inside it.
-So?
Basically turns the trunk into a lockbox.
So?
So we have a place to hide the Colt while we go get Dad.
-We're bringing the Colt with us.
-Can't, Dean.
We only got three bullets left.
We can't just use them on any demon.
-We gotta use them on the demon.
-No, we have to save Dad, Sam.
Okay, we need all the help we can get.
Do you know how pissed Dad would be if we used all the bullets?
-He wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
-l don't care.
I don't care what Dad wants.
Since when do you care what Dad wants?
We wanna kill this demon.
You used to want that too.
Hell, you're the one who came and got me at school.
You're the one who dragged me back into this.
I'm just trying to finish it.
You and Dad are more alike than I thought, you know that?
You both can't wait to sacrifice yourself.
But you know what?
I'm gonna be the one to bury you.
It's selfish, you know that?
You don't care about anything but revenge.
That's not true, Dean.
I want Dad back.
They are expecting us to bring this gun.
They get the gun, they will kill us all.
That Colt is our only leverage and you know it, Dean.
We cannot bring that gun.
-We can't.
-Fine.
-l'm serious, Dean.
-l said fine, Sam.
Hey, hey.
I think I know what Meg meant by "sunrise."
Son of a bitch. lt's pretty smart.
If these demons can possess people, they can possess anybody inside.
Yeah, and make anybody attack us.
Yeah, so we can't kill them.
A building full of human shields.
They probably know what we look like too.
And they could look like anybody.
-Man, this sucks out loud.
-Yeah, tell me about it.
All right, so how the hell are we gonna get in?
Pull the fire alarm.
Get out all the civilians.
Okay, but then the city responds in what, seven minutes?
Seven minutes exactly.
Hey, what--?
What's happening?
Is it a fire?
We're figuring that out now, sir.
Just stay back.
Well, I got a Yorkie upstairs.
-He pees when he's nervous.
-Sir, you have to stay back.
I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up.
You never told me that.
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Dad.
Dad.
He's still breathing.
Dad, wake up.
Dad!
-Wait.
Wait.
-What?
He could be possessed, for all we know.
-Are you nuts?
-Dean.
We gotta be sure.
Sam?
Why are you splashing water on me?
-Dad, you okay?
-They've been drugging me.
-Where's the Colt?
-Don't worry, Dad.
It's safe.
Good boys.
Good boys.
Hey, buddy.
You can't go in.
Go.
Go.
Come on.
Back, back.
Go.
Sam, let's go.
Sam.
Sam, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.
-How is he?
-He just needed a little rest, that's all.
How are you?
I'll survive.
Hey, you don't think we were followed here, do you?
I don't know. I don't think so.
I mean, we couldn't have found a more out-of-the-way place to hole up.
Yeah.
Hey, Dean, you--
You saved my life back there.
So I guess you're glad I brought the gun, huh?
Man, I'm trying to thank you here.
You're welcome.
-
- Hey, Sam.
- Yeah?
You know that guy I shot?
There was a person in there.
You didn't have a choice, Dean.
Yeah, I know.
That's not what bothers me.
Then what does?
Killing that guy, killing Meg I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.
I mean, for you or Dad, the things I'm willing to do or kill, it's just....
It scares me sometimes.
It shouldn't.
You did good.
You're not mad?
-For what?
-Using a bullet.
Mad?
I'm proud of you.
You know, Sam and I, we can get pretty obsessed.
But you-
- You--
You watch out for this family.
You always have.
Thanks.
-lt found us. lt's here.
-The demon.
Sam, lines of salt.
In front of every window, every door.
-l already did it.
-Well, check it.
-Okay?
-Okay.
-Dean, you got the gun?
-Yeah.
-Give it to me.
-Sam tried to shoot the demon...
-...and it vanished.
-This is me.
I won't miss.
Now, the gun.
Hurry.
Son, please.
Give me the gun.
What are you doing?
-He'd be furious.
-What?
That I wasted a bullet.
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.
You're not my dad.
-Dean, it's me.
-l know my dad better than anyone.
-You ain't him.
-What's gotten into you?
I could ask you the same thing.
Stay back.
Dean.
What the hell's going on?
Your brother's lost his mind.
-He's not Dad.
-What?
I think he's possessed.
He's been possessed since we rescued him.
-Don't listen.
-Dean, how do you know?
-He's-
- He's different.
-You know, we don't have time for this.
Sam, you wanna kill this demon, you gotta trust me.
Sam.
No.
Fine.
You're both so sure.
Go ahead.
Kill me.
I thought so.
What a pain in the ass this thing's been.
It's you, isn't it?
-We've been looking for you a long time.
-Well, you found me.
But the holy water....
You think something like that works on something like me?
I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, that would be a neat trick.
In fact, here.
Make the gun float to you there, psychic boy.
You know, this is fun.
I could've killed you a hundred times today, but this--
This is worth the wait.
Your dad, he's in here with me.
Trapped inside his own meat suit.
He says hi, by the way.
He's gonna tear you apart.
-He's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
-Let him go.
-Or I swear to God--
-What?
What are you and God gonna do?
You see, as far as I'm concerned, this is justice.
You know that little exorcism of yours?
That was my daughter.
-Who, Meg?
-The one in the alley that was my boy.
You understand?
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What?
You're the only one that can have a family?
You destroyed my children.
How would you feel if I killed your family?
Oh, that's right.
I forgot, I did.
Still, two wrongs don't make a right.
-You son of a bitch.
-l wanna know why.
-Why did you do it?
-You mean, why did I kill Mommy...
-...and pretty little Jess?
-Yeah.
You know, I never told you this, but Sam was gonna ask her to marry him.
Been shopping for rings and everything.
You wanna know why?
-They got in the way.
-ln the way of what?
My plans for you, Sammy.
You and all of the children like you.
Listen, you mind just getting this over with, huh?
-l really can't stand the monologuing.
-Funny.
But that's all part of your m.o., isn't it?
Masks all that nasty pain.
Masks the truth.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You know, you fight and you fight for this family, but the truth is they don't need you.
Not like you need them.
Sam, he's clearly John's favorite.
Even when they fight, it's more concern than he's ever shown you.
I'll bet you're real proud of your kids too, huh?
Oh, wait, I forgot.
I wasted them.
Dean.
No!
Dad.
Dad.
-Dad.
-Dad.
Don't you let it kill me.
Dean!
Dad, please.
Dean!
-No!
Don't!
-Stop.
Stop it.
You kill me, you kill Daddy.
I know.
Dean.
Dean.
Hey.
Oh, God.
You lost a lot of blood.
-Where's Dad?
-He's right here.
-He's right here, Dean.
-Go check on him.
-Dean.
-Go check on him.
Dad.
Sammy!
It's still alive.
It's inside me.
I can feel it.
Just shoot me.
You shoot me.
You shoot me in the heart, son.
-Do it now!
-Sam, don't you do it.
Don't you do it.
You gotta hurry.
I can't hold onto it much longer.
Just shoot me, son.
Shoot me!
Son, I'm begging you.
We can end this, here and now.
Sammy!
-Sam, no.
-You do this!
Sammy!
Sam.
Look, just hold on, all right?
The hospital's only 10 minutes away.
I'm surprised at you, Sammy.
Why didn't you kill it?
I thought we saw eye to eye on this.
Killing this demon comes first.
Before me, before everything.
No, sir.
Not before everything.
Look, we still got the Colt.
We still have the one bullet left.
We should start over, all right?
I mean, we already found the demon once--
You boys really screwed up this time.
Where is he?
You're never gonna see your father again.
They've got dad.
Meg?
What did she say?
I just told you, sammy.
Okay.
What are you doing, dean?
We got to go.
Why?
Because the demon knows we're in salvation.
It knows we've got the colt.
It's probably coming for us next.
We've still got three bullets left.
Listen, tough guy, we're not ready.
We don't know how many of them are out there.
We're no good to anybody dead.
We're leaving...now.
I'm telling you, dean, we could've taken him.
What we need is a plan.
They're keeping dad alive.
We've got to figure out where.
They're gonna want to trade him for the gun.
What?
If that were true, why didn't meg mention a trade?
Dad, he might be -
I don't want to believe it any more than you,
But if he is, all the more reason to kill this damn thing.
We still have the colt.
We can still finish the job.
Screw the job, sam!
Dean, i'm just trying to do what he would want.
Would you quit talking about him like he's dead already?
Listen to me.
Everything stops until we get him back.
Everything.
So, how do we find him?
Maybe we go to lincoln.
Start at the warehouse where he was taken.
You really think these demons are gonna leave a trail?
You're right.
We need help.
Here you go.
What is this
- Holy water?
That one is.
This is whiskey.
Bobby, thanks.
Thanks for everything.
To tell you the truth, i wasn't sure if we should come.
Nonsense.
Your daddy needs help.
The last time we saw you,
You did threaten to blast him full of buckshot.
You cocked the shotgun and everything.
Yeah, well, what can i say?
John just has that effect on people.
Yeah, i guess he does.
None of that matters now.
All that matters is that you get him back.
Bobby, this book.
I've never seen anything like it.
Key of solomon?
It's the real deal, all right.
And these protective circles
- They really work?
Hell yeah.
You get a demon in one, they're trapped.
They're powerless.
It's like a satanic roach motel.
Dean: the man knows his stuff.
I'll tell you something else, too.
This is some serious crap you boys stepped in.
Oh, yeah?
How's that?
Normal year, i hear, say, three demonic possessions,
Maybe four, tops.
This year, i heard of 27 so far.
You get what i'm saying?
More and more demons are walking among us
- A lot more.
Do you know why?
No, but i know it's something big.
The storm's coming, and you boys, your daddy -
You are smack in the middle of it.
Rumsfeld.
What is it?
Something's wrong.
No more crap, okay?
I want the colt, sam
- The real colt -
Right now.
We don't have it on us.
We buried it.
Didn't i say "no more crap"?
I swear
- After everything i heard about you winchesters,
I've got to tell you, i'm a little underwhelmed.
First johnny tries to pawn off a fake gun,
And then he leaves the real gun with you two chuckleheads.
Lackluster, men.
I mean, did you really think i wouldn't find you?
Actually, we were counting on it.
Gotcha.
You know, if you wanted to tie me up,
All you had to do was ask.
I salted the doors and windows.
If there are any demons out there, they ain't getting in.
Where's our father, meg?
You didn't ask very nice.
Where's our father, bitch?
Jeez.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Oh, i forgot.
You don't.
You think this is a freaking game?
!
Where is he?
!
What did you do to him?
!
He died screaming.
I killed him myself.
That's kind of a turn-On
- You hitting a girl.
You're no girl.
Dean.
You okay?
She's lying.
He's not dead.
Dean, you've got to be careful with her.
Don't hurt her.
Why?
Because she really is a girl.
That's why.
What are you talking about?
She's possessed.
That's a human possessed by a demon.
Can't you tell?
Are you trying to tell me there's an innocent girl
Trapped somewhere in there?
That's actually good news.
Are you gonna read me a story?
Something like that.
Hit it, sam.
"Regna terrae, cantáTe deo, psáLlite dóMino..."
An exorcism?
Are you serious?
We're going for it, baby
- Head spinning,
Projectile vomiting, the whole nine yards.
"Tribuite virtutem deo."
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna rip the bones from your body.
No, you're gonna burn in hell
Unless you tell us where our dad is.
Well, at least you'll get a nice tan.
"Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus,
"Omnis satanica potestas,
"Omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio,
"Omnis congregatio et secta diabolica."
Aah!
He begged for his life with tears in his eyes.
He begged to see his sons one last time.
That's when i slit his throat.
"Ergo..."
For your sake, i hope you're lying.
'Cause if it's true, i swear to god,
I will march into hell myself,
And i will slaughter each and every one
Of you evil sons of bitches, so help me god.
"Perditionis venenum propinare.
"Vade, satana, inventor et magister omnis fallaciae,
"Hostis humanae salutis.
"Humiliare sub potenti manu dei, contremisce et effuge,
"Invocato a nobis sancto et terribili nomine,
Quem inferi tremunt."
Aah!
Where is he?
You just won't take "dead" for an answer, will you?
Where is he?
!
Dead!
No, he's not!
He's not dead!
He can't be!
What are you looking at?
Keep reading.
"Ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos, domine.
"Ut ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias libertate servire,
Te rogamus, audi nos."
Aaaah!
"Ut inimicos sanctae ecclesiae humiliare digneris,
Te rogamus audi -"
He will be!
Wait!
What?
!
He's not dead,
But he will be after what we do to him.
How do we know you're telling the truth?
You don't.
Sam!
A building!
Okay?
A building in jefferson city.
Missouri?
Where, where?
An address.
I don't know.
And the demon
- Where is it?
I don't know.
I swear.
That's everything.
That's all i know.
Finish it.
What?
I told you the truth.
I don't care.
You son of a bitch.
You promised.
I lied!
Sam?
Sam!
Read.
We can still use her, find out where the demon is.
She doesn't know.
There's an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there.
We've got to help her.
You're gonna kill her.
What?
You said she fell from a building.
That girl's body is broken.
The only thing keeping her alive is that demon inside.
You exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.
We are not gonna leave her like that.
She is a human being.
And we're gonna put her out of her misery.
Sam, finish it.
Finish it.
"Dominicos sanctae ecclesiae.
"Terogamus audi nos.
"Terribilis deus de sanctuario suo deus israhel
"Ipse tribuite virtutem et fortitudinem plebi suae.
Benedictus deus.
Gloria patri."
Dean: she's still alive.
Call 911.
Get some water and blankets.
Thank you.
Shh, shh, just take it easy, all right?
Thank you.
Shh.
Come on.
Let's get her down.
Sorry, sorry.
I've got you.
I've got you.
It's okay.
It's okay.
A year.
What?
It's been a year.
Just take it easy.
I've been awake for some of it.
I couldn't move my own body.
The things i did
- It's a nightmare.
Was it telling us the truth about our dad?
Dean.
We need to know.
Yes.
But it wants... you to know
That...they want you to come for him.
If dad's still alive, none of that matters.
Where is the demon we're looking for?
Not there.
Other ones.
Awful ones.
Where are they keeping our dad?
By the r-River.
Sunrise.
"Sunrise"?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You better hurry up and beat it
Before the paramedics get here.
What are you gonna tell them?
You think you guys invented lying to the cops?
I'll figure something out.
Here.
Take this.
You might need it.
Thanks.
Thanks...for everything.
Be careful, all right?
Just go find your dad.
And when you do, you bring him around, would you?
I won't even try to shoot him this time.
You've been quiet.
Just getting ready.
He's gonna be fine, dean.
Dude, what are you drawing on my car?
It's called a devil's trap.
Demons can't get through it or inside it.
So?
It basically turns the trunk into a lockbox.
So?
So we have a place to hide the colt while we go get dad.
What are you talking about?
We're bringing the colt with us.
We can't, dean.
We've only got three bullets left.
We can't just use them on any demon.
We've got to use them on the demon.
No, we have to save dad, sam, okay?
We're gonna need all the help we can get.
You know how pissed dad would be if we used all the bullets?
Dean, he wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
I don't care, sam!
I don't care what dad wants, okay?
Since when do you care what dad wants?
We want to kill this demon.
You used to want that, too.
Hell, you're the one who came and got me at school!
You're the one who dragged me into this.
I'm just trying to finish it.
Well, you and dad are a lot more alike than i thought.
You both can't wait to sacrifice yourself for this thing.
But you know what?
I'm gonna be the one to bury you.
You're selfish, you know that?
You don't care about anything but revenge.
That's not true, dean.
I want dad back,
But they are expecting us to bring this gun.
They get the gun, they will kill us all.
That colt is our only leverage, and you know it, dean.
We cannot bring that gun.
We can't.
Fine.
I'm serious, dean.
I said "fine," sam.
Hey, hey.
I think i know what meg meant by "sunrise."
Son of a bitch.
That's pretty smart.
If these demons can possess people,
They can possess almost anybody inside.
And make anybody attack us.
And so we can't kill 'em -
A building full of human shields.
They probably know exactly what we look like, too,
And they could look like anybody.
This sucks out loud.
All right, so, how the hell are we gonna get in?
Pull the fire alarm, get out all the civilians.
But then the city responds in seven minutes.
Seven minutes, exactly.
You okay?
Hey, what's happening?
Is it a fire?
We're figuring that out right now, sir.
Just stay back.
I got a yorkie upstairs, and he pees when he's nervous.
Sir, you have to stay back.
I always wanted to be a fireman when i grew up.
You never told me that.
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.
Hurry up!
Dad.
He's still breathing.
Dad, wake up.
Dad!
Wait.
Wait.
What?
He could be possessed, for all we know.
What, are you nuts?
Dean, we got to be sure.
Sam?
Why are you splashing water on me?
Dad, are you okay?
They've been drugging me.
Where's the colt?
Don't worry, dad, it's safe.
Good, boys.
Good, boys.
Hey, buddy, you can't go in.
Go!
Back, back!
Go!
Sam, let's go!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, we've got to get out of here.
How is he?
He just needed a little rest, that's all.
How are you?
[ Inhales deeply ] i'll survive.
Hey, you don't think we were followed here, do you?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
We couldn't have found
A more out-Of-The-Way place to hole up.
Yeah.
Hey, uh...
Dean, you, um...
You saved my life back there.
So i guess you're glad i brought the gun, huh?
Man, i'm trying to thank you here.
You're welcome.
Hey, sam?
Yeah?
You know that guy i shot?
There was a person in there.
You didn't have a choice, dean.
I know.
That's not what bothers me.
Then what does?
Killing that guy, killing meg.
I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.
For you or dad, the things i'm willing to do or kill,
It's just...
It scares me sometimes.
It shouldn't.
You did good.
You're not mad?
For what?
Using a bullet.
Mad?
I'm proud of you.
You know, sam and i, we can get pretty obsessed.
But you
- You watch out for this family.
You always have.
Thanks.
It found us.
It's here.
The demon?
Sam, lines of salt in front of every window, ever door.
Already did it.
Check it, okay?
Dean, you got the gun?
Yeah.
Give it to me.
Sam tried to shoot the demon.
It vanished.
I won't miss.
Now, the gun.
Hurry.
Son, please.
Give me the gun.
What are you doing, dean?
You'd be furious.
What?
That i wasted a bullet.
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.
You're not my dad.
I know my dad better than anyone,
And you ain't him.
What the hell has gotten into you?
I could ask you the same thing.
Dean?
What the hell is going on?
Your brother's lost his mind.
He's not dad.
What?
I think he's possessed.
I think he's been possessed since we rescued him.
Don't listen to him.
Dean, how do you know?
He's different.
We don't have time for this.
Sam, if you want to kill this demon,
You've got to trust me.
Sam?
No.
No.
Fine.
You're both so sure.
Go ahead.
Kill me.
I thought so.
What a pain in the ass this thing's been.
It's you, isn't it?
We've been looking for you for a long time.
Well, you found me.
But the holy water?
You think something like that works on something like me?
I'm gonna kill you!
Oh, that would be a neat trick.
In fact, here.
Make the gun float to you there, psychic boy.
Well, this is fun.
I could've killed you a hundred times today, but this...
This is worth the wait.
Your dad
- He's in here with me,
Trapped inside his own meat suit.
He says "hi," by the way.
He's gonna tear you apart.
He's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
Let him go, or i swear to god -
What?
What are you and god gonna do?
You see, as far as i'm concerned, this is justice.
You know that little exorcism of yours?
That was my daughter.
Who, meg?
The one in the alley?
That was my boy.
You understand?
You've got to be kidding me.
What?
You're the only one that can have a family?
You destroyed my children.
How would you feel if i killed your family?
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.
I did.
Still, two wrongs don't make a right.
You son of a bitch.
I want to know why.
Why did you do it?
You mean why did i kill mommy and pretty, little jess?
Yeah.
You know, i never told you this,
But sam was gonna ask her to marry him.
Been shopping for rings and everything.
You want to know why?
Because they got in the way.
In the way of what?
My plans for you, sammy -
You...and all the children like you.
Listen, you mind just getting this over with, huh?
'Cause i really can't stand the monologuing.
Funny, but that's all part of your m.O., isn't it?
Mask all that nasty pain, mask the truth.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You know, you fight, and you fight for this family,
But the truth is they don't need you.
Not like you need them.
Sam
- He's clearly john's favorite.
Even when they fight,
It's more concern than he's ever shown you.
I bet you're real proud of your kids, too, huh?
Oh, wait, i forgot.
I wasted 'em.
Aah!
Dean!
No!
Dad!
Dad, don't you let it kill me!
Dean!
Dad, please.
Dean!
No!
Stop.
Stop it.
You kill me, you kill daddy.
I know.
Dean?
Dean?
Hey.
Oh, god, you lost a lot of blood.
Where's dad?
He's right here.
He's right here, dean.
Go check on him.
Dad?
Sammy!
It's still alive.
It's inside me.
I can feel it.
You shoot me.
You shoot me!
You shoot me in the heart, son!
Do it, now!
Sam, don't you do it.
Don't you do it.
You've got to hurry.
I can't hold on to it much longer.
You shoot me, son!
Shoot me!
Son, i'm begging you!
We can end this here and now!
Sammy, you kill me!
Sam, no.
You do this!
Sammy!
Sam, sam...
I'm begging you, son.
You've got to.
I can't hold on to it much longer.
Shoot me!
Look, just hold on, all right?
The hospital is only 10 minutes away.
I'm surprised at you, sammy.
Why didn't you kill it?
I thought we saw eye-To-Eye on this.
Killing this demon comes first -
Before me, before everything.
No, sir, not before everything.
Look, we've still got the colt.
We still have the one bullet left.
We just have to start over, all right?
We already found the demon -
Look, our whole lives we've been searching for this demon.
We finally know where this demon's gonna be and now we know how to kill him.
This ends now.
I'm ending it.
I don't care what it takes.
-A vision.
-Visions or no visions, the fact is the demon is coming tonight.
And this family's gonna go through the same hell we went through.
We know you have the gun, John.
-You just declared war.
-l'll bring you the Colt.
The demon is coming.
That gun is all we got.
DEAN:
Hand Meg a fake gun, hope she doesn't notice?
I've been waiting a long time for this fight.
Nobody's dying tonight.
Not us, not that family.
-Why don't you hand over the gun?
-Maybe I'll just shoot you.
There's more where l came from.
It's coming.
I can't believe you just shot me!
It's a fake.
-Sam, no.
-Let me go.
It's still in there.
It's suicide.
-l don't care.
-l do.
That thing killed Jess.
That thing killed Mom.
DEAN:
They're gone.
And they're never coming back.
Don't you say that.
Not after all this.
[PHONE ringing]
You boys really screwed up this time.
Where is he?
MEG:
You're never gonna see your father again.
-They've got Dad.
-Meg?
-What'd she say?
-l just told you, Sammy.
Okay.
-What are you doing, Dean?
-We gotta go.
-Why?
-The demon knows we're in Salvation.
It knows we've got the Colt.
-lt's got Dad. lt's coming for us.
-Good.
We've got three bullets left.
Listen, we're not ready.
We don't know how many of them are out there.
Now, we're no good to anybody dead.
We're leaving.
Now.
-l'm telling you, we could've taken them.
-What we need is a plan.
They're probably keeping Dad alive.
Just gotta figure out where.
They'll wanna trade him for the gun.
-What?
-Dean, if that were true why didn't Meg mention a trade?
-Dad, he might be--
-Don't.
Look, I don't wanna believe it any more than you but if he is, all the more reason to kill this damn thing.
We still have the Colt.
We can finish the job.
Screw the job, Sam.
I'm just trying to do what he'd want.
He would want us to keep going.
Quit talking about him like he's dead.
Listen to me, everything stops until we get him back.
Do you understand me?
Everything.
-So how do we find him?
DEAN:
We go to Lincoln.
Start at the warehouse where he was taken.
Come on.
You really think these demons are gonna leave a trail?
You're right.
We need help.
Here you go.

Are you serious?

I'm gonna rip the bones from your body.
No, you're gonna burn in hell.

For your sake, I hope you're lying.
Because if it's true, I swear to God I will march into hell myself and I will slaughter each and every one of you evil sons of bitches, so help me, God.
DEAN:
Where is he?
-You just won't take dead for an answer.
-Where is he?
-Dead.
-No, he's not!
He's not dead.
He can't be!
What are you looking at?
Keep reading.
-He will be!
-Wait!
What?
He's not dead.
But he will be after what we do to him.
-How do we know you're telling the truth?
-You don't.
-Sam--!
-A building, okay?
-A building in Jefferson City.
-Missouri?
Where, where?
An address.
-l don't know.
-And the demon.
Where is it?
I don't know. I swear.
That's everything.
That's all I know.
-Finish it.
-What?
-l told you the truth!
-l don't care.
-You son of a bitch, you promised.
-l lied!
Sam.
Sam!
Read.
Maybe we can still use her.
Find out where the demon is.
-She doesn't know.
-She lied!
Sam, there's an innocent girl trapped in there and we've gotta help her.
-You're gonna kill her.
-What?
You said she fell from a building.
That girl's body is broken.
The only thing keeping her alive is that demon inside.
You exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.
We are not gonna leave her like that.
-She is a human being.
-We're gonna put her out of her misery.
Sam, finish it.
Finish it.
She's still alive.
Call 91 1 .
Get some water and blankets.
-Thank you.
-Just take it easy, all right?
Come on, let's-
- Let's get her down.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry.
I gotcha.
Gotcha.
It's okay.
It's okay.
-A year.
-What?
-lt's been a year.
-Just take it easy.
I've been awake for some of it.
I couldn't move my own body.
And things looked-
- It--
It's a nightmare.
-Was it telling the truth about our dad?
-Dean.
-We need to know.
-Yes.
But it wants you to know.
They want you to come for him.
If Dad's still alive, none of that matters.
Where is the demon we're looking for?
Not there.
Other ones.
Awful ones.
Where are they keeping our dad?
By the riv-
- River.
-Sunrise.
-Sunrise?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You better hurry up and beat it before the paramedics get here.
What are you gonna tell them?
You think you guys invented lying to the cops?
I'll figure something out.
Here, take this.
-You might need it.
-Thanks.
Thanks for everything.
-Be careful, all right?
-You just go find your dad.
And when you do, you bring him around, would you?
I won't even try to shoot him this time.
You've been quiet.
Just getting ready.
He's gonna be fine, Dean.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
Dude, what are you drawing on my car?
It's called a devil's trap.
-Demons can't get through it or inside it.
-So?
Basically turns the trunk into a lockbox.
So?
So we have a place to hide the Colt while we go get Dad.
-We're bringing the Colt with us.
-Can't, Dean.
We only got three bullets left.
We can't just use them on any demon.
-We gotta use them on the demon.
-No, we have to save Dad, Sam.
Okay, we need all the help we can get.
Do you know how pissed Dad would be if we used all the bullets?
-He wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
-l don't care.
I don't care what Dad wants.
Since when do you care what Dad wants?
We wanna kill this demon.
You used to want that too.
Hell, you're the one who came and got me at school.
You're the one who dragged me back into this.
I'm just trying to finish it.
You and Dad are more alike than I thought, you know that?
You both can't wait to sacrifice yourself.
But you know what?
I'm gonna be the one to bury you.
It's selfish, you know that?
You don't care about anything but revenge.
That's not true, Dean.
I want Dad back.
They are expecting us to bring this gun.
They get the gun, they will kill us all.
That Colt is our only leverage and you know it, Dean.
We cannot bring that gun.
-We can't.
-Fine.
-l'm serious, Dean.
-l said fine, Sam.
Hey, hey.
I think I know what Meg meant by "sunrise."
Son of a bitch. lt's pretty smart.
If these demons can possess people, they can possess anybody inside.
Yeah, and make anybody attack us.
Yeah, so we can't kill them.
A building full of human shields.
They probably know what we look like too.
And they could look like anybody.
-Man, this sucks out loud.
-Yeah, tell me about it.
All right, so how the hell are we gonna get in?
Pull the fire alarm.
Get out all the civilians.
Okay, but then the city responds in what, seven minutes?
Seven minutes exactly.
Hey, what--?
What's happening?
Is it a fire?
We're figuring that out now, sir.
Just stay back.
Well, I got a Yorkie upstairs.
-He pees when he's nervous.
-Sir, you have to stay back.
DEAN:
I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up.
SAM:
You never told me that.
[KNOCKlNG]
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
[DOOR banging]
[DOOR banging STOPS]
[PANTlNG]
Come on.
Dad.
Dad.
He's still breathing.
Dad, wake up.
Dad!
-Wait.
Wait.
-What?
He could be possessed, for all we know.
-Are you nuts?
-Dean.
We gotta be sure.
Sam?
Why are you splashing water on me?
-Dad, you okay?
-They've been drugging me.
-Where's the Colt?
-Don't worry, Dad.
It's safe.
Good boys.
Good boys.
Hey, buddy.
You can't go in.
Go.
Go.
Come on.
Back, back.
Go.
Sam, let's go.
Sam.
Sam, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.
-How is he?
-He just needed a little rest, that's all.
How are you?
I'll survive.
Hey, you don't think we were followed here, do you?
I don't know. I don't think so.
I mean, we couldn't have found a more out-of-the-way place to hole up.
Yeah.
Hey, Dean, you--
You saved my life back there.
So I guess you're glad I brought the gun, huh?
Man, I'm trying to thank you here.
You're welcome.
-Hey, Sam.
SAM:
Yeah?
You know that guy I shot?
There was a person in there.
You didn't have a choice, Dean.
Yeah, I know.
That's not what bothers me.
Then what does?
Killing that guy, killing Meg I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.
I mean, for you or Dad, the things I'm willing to do or kill, it's just....
It scares me sometimes.
It shouldn't.
You did good.
You're not mad?
-For what?
-Using a bullet.
Mad?
I'm proud of you.
You know, Sam and I, we can get pretty obsessed.
But you-
- You--
You watch out for this family.
You always have.
Thanks.
-lt found us. lt's here.
-The demon.
Sam, lines of salt.
In front of every window, every door.
-l already did it.
-Well, check it.
-Okay?
-Okay.
-Dean, you got the gun?
-Yeah.
-Give it to me.
-Sam tried to shoot the demon...
-...and it vanished.
-This is me.
I won't miss.
Now, the gun.
Hurry.
Son, please.
Give me the gun.
What are you doing?
-He'd be furious.
-What?
That I wasted a bullet.
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.
You're not my dad.
-Dean, it's me.
-l know my dad better than anyone.
-You ain't him.
-What's gotten into you?
I could ask you the same thing.
Stay back.
Dean.
What the hell's going on?
Your brother's lost his mind.
-He's not Dad.
-What?
I think he's possessed.
He's been possessed since we rescued him.
-Don't listen.
-Dean, how do you know?
-He's-
- He's different.
-You know, we don't have time for this.
Sam, you wanna kill this demon, you gotta trust me.
Sam.
No.
Fine.
You're both so sure.
Go ahead.
Kill me.
I thought so.
What a pain in the ass this thing's been.
It's you, isn't it?
-We've been looking for you a long time.
-Well, you found me.
But the holy water....
You think something like that works on something like me?
I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, that would be a neat trick.
In fact, here.
Make the gun float to you there, psychic boy.
You know, this is fun.
I could've killed you a hundred times today, but this--
This is worth the wait.
Your dad, he's in here with me.
Trapped inside his own meat suit.
He says hi, by the way.
He's gonna tear you apart.
-He's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
-Let him go.
-Or I swear to God--
-What?
What are you and God gonna do?
You see, as far as I'm concerned, this is justice.
You know that little exorcism of yours?
That was my daughter.
-Who, Meg?
-The one in the alley that was my boy.
You understand?
-You gotta be kidding me.
-What?
You're the only one that can have a family?
You destroyed my children.
How would you feel if I killed your family?
Oh, that's right.
I forgot, I did.
Still, two wrongs don't make a right.
-You son of a bitch.
-l wanna know why.
-Why did you do it?
-You mean, why did I kill Mommy...
-...and pretty little Jess?
-Yeah.
You know, I never told you this, but Sam was gonna ask her to marry him.
Been shopping for rings and everything.
You wanna know why?
-They got in the way.
-ln the way of what?
My plans for you, Sammy.
You and all of the children like you.
Listen, you mind just getting this over with, huh?
-l really can't stand the monologuing.
-Funny.
But that's all part of your m.o., isn't it?
Masks all that nasty pain.
Masks the truth.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You know, you fight and you fight for this family, but the truth is they don't need you.
Not like you need them.
Sam, he's clearly John's favorite.
Even when they fight, it's more concern than he's ever shown you.
I'll bet you're real proud of your kids too, huh?
Oh, wait, I forgot.
I wasted them.
Dean.
No!
Dad.
Dad.
-Dad.
-Dad.
Don't you let it kill me.
Dean!
Dad, please.
Dean!
-No!
Don't!
-Stop.
Stop it.
You kill me, you kill Daddy.
I know.
Dean.
Dean.
Hey.
Oh, God.
You lost a lot of blood.
-Where's Dad?
-He's right here.
-He's right here, Dean.
-Go check on him.
-Dean.
-Go check on him.
Dad.
Sammy!
It's still alive.
It's inside me.
I can feel it.
Just shoot me.
You shoot me.
You shoot me in the heart, son.
-Do it now!
-Sam, don't you do it.
Don't you do it.
You gotta hurry.
I can't hold onto it much longer.
Just shoot me, son.
Shoot me!
Son, I'm begging you.
We can end this, here and now.
Sammy!
-Sam, no.
-You do this!
Sammy!
Sam.
[SCREAMS]
Look, just hold on, all right?
The hospital's only 1 0 minutes away.
I'm surprised at you, Sammy.
Why didn't you kill it?
I thought we saw eye to eye on this.
Killing this demon comes first.
Before me, before everything.
No, sir.
Not before everything.
Look, we still got the Colt.
We still have the one bullet left.
We should start over, all right?
I mean, we already found the demon once--
[ENGLISH SDH]
you boys really screwed up this time.
where is he?
you're never gonna see your father again.
they've got dad.
meg?
what did she say?
i just told you, sammy.
okay.
okay.
what are you doing, dean?
we got to go.
why?
because the demon knows we're in salvation.
it knows we've got the colt.
it's probably coming for us next.
we've still got three bullets left.
listen, tough guy, we're not ready.
we don't know how many of them are out there.
we're no good to anybody dead.
we're leaving...now.
i'm telling you, dean, we could've taken him.
what we need is a plan.
they're keeping dad alive.
we've got to figure out where.
they're gonna want to trade him for the gun.
what?
if that were true, why didn't meg mention a trade?
dad, he might be -- i don't want to believe it any more than you, but if he is, all the more reason to kill this damn thing.
we still have the colt.
we can still finish the job.
screw the job, sam!
dean, i'm just trying to do what he would want.
would you quit talking about him like he's dead already?
listen to me.
everything stops until we get him back.
everything.
so, how do we find him?
maybe we go to lincoln.
start at the warehouse where he was taken.
you really think these demons are gonna leave a trail?
you're right.
we need help.
here you go.
what is this -- holy water?
that one is.
this is whiskey.
bobby, thanks.
thanks for everything.
to tell you the truth, i wasn't sure if we should come.
nonsense.
your daddy needs help.
the last time we saw you, you did threaten to blast him full of buckshot.
you cocked the shotgun and everything.
yeah, well, what can i say?
john just has that effect on people.
yeah, i guess he does.
none of that matters now.
all that matters is that you get him back.
bobby, this book.
[ chuckles ] i've never seen anything like it.
key of solomon?
it's the real deal, all right.
and these protective circles -- they really work?
hell yeah.
you get a demon in one, they're trapped.
they're powerless.
it's like a satanic roach motel.
dean:
the man knows his stuff.
i'll tell you something else, too.
this is some serious crap you boys stepped in.
oh, yeah?
how's that?
normal year, i hear, say, three demonic possessions, maybe four, tops.
this year, i heard of 27 so far.
you get what i'm saying?
more and more demons are walking among us -- a lot more.
do you know why?
no, but i know it's something big.
the storm's coming, and you boys, your daddy -- you are smack in the middle of it.
rumsfeld.
what is it?
something's wrong.
no more crap, okay?
i want the colt, sam -- the real colt -- right now.
we don't have it on us.
we buried it.
didn't i say "no more crap"?
i swear -- after everything i heard about you winchesters, i've got to tell you, i'm a little underwhelmed.
first johnny tries to pawn off a fake gun, and then he leaves the real gun with you two chuckleheads.
lackluster, men.
i mean, did you really think i wouldn't find you?
actually, we were counting on it.
gotcha.
you know, if you wanted to tie me up, all you had to do was ask.
i salted the doors and windows.
if there are any demons out there, they ain't getting in.
where's our father, meg?
you didn't ask very nice.
where's our father, bitch?
jeez. you kiss your mother with that mouth?
oh, i forgot. you don't.
you think this is a freaking game?
!
where is he?
!
what did you do to him?
!
he died screaming.
i killed him myself.
that's kind of a turn-on -- you hitting a girl.
you're no girl.
dean.
you okay?
she's lying.
he's not dead.
dean, you've got to be careful with her. don't hurt her.
why?
because she really is a girl.
that's why.
what are you talking about?
she's possessed.
that's a human possessed by a demon.
can't you tell?
are you trying to tell me there's an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there?
that's actually good news.
are you gonna read me a story?
something like that.
hit it, sam.
"regna terrae, cantáTe deo, psáLlite dóMino..."
an exorcism?
are you serious?
we're going for it, baby -- head spinning, projectile vomiting, the whole nine yards.
"tribuite virtutem deo."
i'm gonna kill you.
i'm gonna rip the bones from your body.
no, you're gonna burn in hell unless you tell us where our dad is.
well, at least you'll get a nice tan.
"exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus,
"omnis satanica potestas,
"omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio,
"omnis congregatio et secta diabolica."
aah!
he begged for his life with tears in his eyes.
he begged to see his sons one last time.
that's when i slit his throat.
"ergo..."
for your sake, i hope you're lying.
'cause if it's true, i swear to god, i will march into hell myself, and i will slaughter each and every one of you evil sons of bitches, so help me god.

"vade, satana, inventor et magister omnis fallaciae,
"hostis humanae salutis.
"humiliare sub potenti manu dei, contremisce et effuge,

aah!
where is he?
you just won't take "dead" for an answer, will you?
where is he?
!
dead!
no, he's not!
he's not dead!
he can't be!
what are you looking at?
keep reading.
"ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos, domine.
"ut ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos."
aaaah!
"ut inimicos sanctae ecclesiae humiliare digneris, te rogamus audi --"
he will be!
wait!
what?
!
he's not dead, but he will be after what we do to him.
how do we know you're telling the truth?
you don't.
sam!
a building!
okay?
a building in jefferson city.
missouri?
where, where?
an address.
i don't know.
and the demon -- where is it?
i don't know. i swear.
that's everything.
that's all i know.
finish it.
what?
i told you the truth.
i don't care.
you son of a bitch.
you promised.
i lied!
sam?
sam!
read.
we can still use her, find out where the demon is.
she doesn't know.
there's an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there.
we've got to help her.
you're gonna kill her.
what?
you said she fell from a building.
that girl's body is broken.
the only thing keeping her alive is that demon inside.
you exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.
we are not gonna leave her like that.
she is a human being.
and we're gonna put her out of her misery.
sam, finish it.
finish it.

let's get her down.
sorry, sorry.
i've got you.
i've got you.

it's been a year.
just take it easy.
i've been awake for some of it.

we need to know.
yes.

not there.

where are they keeping our dad?
by the r-river.

what does that mean?
what does that mean?
you better hurry up and beat it before the paramedics get here.
what are you gonna tell them?
you think you guys invented lying to the cops?
i'll figure something out.
here. take this.
you might need it.
thanks.
thanks...for everything.
be careful, all right?
just go find your dad.
and when you do, you bring him around, would you?
i won't even try to shoot him this time.
you've been quiet.
just getting ready.
he's gonna be fine, dean.
dude, what are you drawing on my car?
it's called a devil's trap.
demons can't get through it or inside it.
so?
it basically turns the trunk into a lockbox.
so?
so we have a place to hide the colt while we go get dad.
what are you talking about?
we're bringing the colt with us.
we can't, dean.
we've only got three bullets left.
we can't just use them on any demon.
we've got to use them on the demon.
no, we have to save dad, sam, okay?
we're gonna need all the help we can get.
you know how pissed dad would be if we used all the bullets?
dean, he wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
i don't care, sam!
i don't care what dad wants, okay?
since when do you care what dad wants?
we want to kill this demon.
you used to want that, too.
hell, you're the one who came and got me at school!
you're the one who dragged me into this.
i'm just trying to finish it.
well, you and dad are a lot more alike than i thought.

we can't.

i'm serious, dean.
i said "fine," sam.
hey, hey.
i think i know what meg meant by "sunrise."
son of a bitch.
that's pretty smart.
if these demons can possess people, they can possess almost anybody inside.
and make anybody attack us.
and so we can't kill 'em -- a building full of human shields.
they probably know exactly what we look like, too, and they could look like anybody.
this sucks out loud.

killing that guy, killing meg.
i didn't hesitate.
i didn't even flinch.
for you or dad, the things i'm willing to do or kill, it's just... it scares me sometimes.
[ sighs ] it shouldn't.
you did good.
you're not mad?
for what?
using a bullet.
mad?
i'm proud of you.
you know, sam and i, we can get pretty obsessed.
but you -- you watch out for this family.
you always have.
thanks.
it found us. it's here.
the demon?
sam, lines of salt in front of every window, ever door.
already did it.
check it, okay?
dean, you got the gun?
yeah.
give it to me.
sam tried to shoot the demon.
it vanished.

your dad -- he's in here with me, trapped inside his own meat suit.
he says "hi," by the way.
he's gonna tear you apart.
he's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
let him go, or i swear to god -- what?
what are you and god gonna do?
you see, as far as i'm concerned, this is justice.
you know that little exorcism of yours?
that was my daughter.
who, meg?
the one in the alley?
that was my boy.
you understand?
you've got to be kidding me.
what?
you're the only one that can have a family?
you destroyed my children.
how would you feel if i killed your family?
oh, that's right.
i forgot. i did.
still, two wrongs don't make a right.
you son of a bitch.
i want to know why.
why did you do it?
you mean why did i kill mommy and pretty, little jess?
yeah.
you know, i never told you this, but sam was gonna ask her to marry him.
been shopping for rings and everything.
you want to know why?
because they got in the way.
in the way of what?
my plans for you, sammy -- you...and all the children like you.
listen, you mind just getting this over with, huh?
'cause i really can't stand the monologuing.
funny, but that's all part of your m.o., isn't it?
mask all that nasty pain, mask the truth.
oh, yeah?
what's that?
you know, you fight, and you fight for this family, but the truth is they don't need you.
not like you need them.
sam -- he's clearly john's favorite.
even when they fight, it's more concern than he's ever shown you.
i bet you're real proud of your kids, too, huh?
oh, wait, i forgot.
i wasted 'em.
aah!
dean!
no!
dad!
dad, don't you let it kill me!
dean!
dad, please.
dean!
no!
stop.
stop it.
you kill me, you kill daddy.
i know.
dean?
dean?
hey.
oh, god, you lost a lot of blood.
where's dad?
he's right here.
he's right here, dean.
go check on him.
go check on him.
dad?
dad?
sammy!
it's still alive.
it's inside me. i can feel it.
you shoot me.
you shoot me!
you shoot me in the heart, son!
do it, now!
sam, don't you do it.
don't you do it.
you've got to hurry.
i can't hold on to it much longer.
you shoot me, son!
shoot me!
son, i'm begging you!
we can end this here and now!
sammy, you kill me!
sam, no.
you do this!
sammy!
sam, sam... i'm begging you, son.
you've got to.
i can't hold on to it much longer.
shoot me!
look, just hold on, all right?
the hospital is only 10 minutes away.
i'm surprised at you, sammy.
why didn't you kill it?
i thought we saw eye-to-eye on this.
killing this demon comes first -- before me, before everything.
no, sir, not before everything.
look, we've still got the colt.
we still have the one bullet left.
we just have to start over, all right?
we already found the demon --
You boys really screwed up this time.
Where is he?
You're never gonna see your father again.
They've got dad.
Meg?
- What did she say?
- I just told you, Sammy.
Okay.
Okay.
What are you doing, Dean?
We got to go.
Why?
Because the demon knows we're in Salvation, alright?
It knows we've got the colt.
It gots dad.
It's probably coming for us next.
Good.
We've still got three bullets left.
Listen, tough guy, we're not ready.
Okay?
We don't know how many of them are out there.
Look, we're no good to anybody dead.
We're leaving... now.
I'm telling you, Dean, we could've taken him.
All we need is a plan.
They're probably keeping dad alive.
We just have to figure out where.
They're gonna want to trade him for the gun.
- What?
- Dean, if that were true, why didn't Meg mention a trade?
Dad...
- He might be...
- Don't!
I don't want to believe it any more than you, but if he is...
All the more reason to kill this damn thing.
We still have the colt.
We can still finish the job.
Screw the job, Sam!
Dean, I'm just trying to do what he would want.
He would have wanted us to keep going.
Quit talking about him like he's dead already!
Listen to me.
Everything stops until we get him back.
You understand me?
Everything.
So, how do we find him?
Maybe we go to Lincoln.
Start at the warehouse where he was taken.
Come on, Dean.
You really think these demons are gonna leave a trail?
You're right.
We need help.
Here you go.
What is this... holy water?
That one is.
This is whiskey.
Bobby, thanks.
Thanks for everything.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure if we should come.
Nonsense.
Your daddy needs help.
Yeah, but the last time we saw you, you did threaten to blast him full of buckshot.
You cocked the shotgun and everything.
Yeah, well, what can I say?
John just has that effect on people.
Yeah, I guess he does.
None of that matters now.
All that matters is that you get him back.
Bobby, this book...
- I've never seen anything like it.
- "Key of Solomon"?
It's the real deal, all right.
And these uh... these protective circles, they really work?
Hell yeah!
You get a demon in one, they're trapped.
Powerless.
It's like a satanic roach motel.
The man knows his stuff.
I'll tell you something else, too.
This is some serious crap you boys stepped in.
Oh, yeah?
- How's that?
- Normal year, I hear of say, three demonic possessions, maybe four, tops.
- Yeah?
- This year, I heard of 27 so far.
You get what I'm saying?
More and more demons are walking among us.
- A lot more.
- Do you know why?
No, but I know it's something big.
The storm's coming, and you boys, your daddy... you are smack in the middle of it.
Rumsfeld.
What is it?
Something's wrong.
No more crap, okay?
I want the colt, Sam.
The real colt.
Right now.
We don't have it on us.
We buried it.
Didn't I say "no more crap"?
I swear...
After everything I heard about you Winchesters,
I've got to tell you, I'm a little underwhelmed.
First Johnny tries to pawn off a fake gun, and then he leaves the real gun with you two chuckleheads.
Lackluster, men.
I mean, did you really think
I wouldn't find you?
A ctually, we were counting on it.
Gotcha.
You know, if you wanted to tie me up, all you had to do was ask.
I salted the doors and windows.
If there are any demons out there, they ain't getting in.
Where's our father, Meg?
You didn't ask very nice.
Where's our father, bitch?
Jeez.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Oh, I forgot.
You don't.
You think this is a freaking game?
!
Where is he?
!
What did you do to him?
!
He died screaming.
I killed him myself.
That's kind of a turn-on...
You hitting a girl.
You're no girl.
Dean,
- you okay?
- She's lying.
He's not dead.
Dean, you've got to be careful with her.
Don't hurt her.
- Why?
- Because she really is a girl.
- That's why.
- What are you talking about?
She's possessed.
That's a human possessed by a demon.
Can't you tell?
Are you trying to tell me there's an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there?
That's actually good news.
Are you gonna read me a story?
Something like that.
Hit it, Sam.
"regna terrae, cantáTe deo, psáLlite dóMino"...
An exorcism?
Are you serious?
We're going for it, baby...
Head spinning, projectile vomiting, the whole nine yards.
"tribuite virtutem deo".
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna rip the bones from your body.
No, you're gonna burn in Hell.
Unless you tell us where our dad is.
Well, at least you'll get a nice tan.
"exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus,
"omnis satanica potestas,
"omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio,
"omnis congregatio et secta diabolica3"...
He begged for his life with tears in his eyes.
He begged to see his sons one last time.
That's when I slit his throat.
"ergo"...
For your sake,
I hope you're lying.
'cause if it's true, I swear to god,
I will march into Hell myself, and I will slaughter each and every one of you evil sons of bitches, so help me God.

"vade, satana, inventor et magister omnis fallaciae,
"hostis humanae salutis.
"humiliare sub potenti manu dei, contremisce et effuge,

Where is he?
You just won't take "dead" for an answer, will you?
- Where is he?
!
- Dead!
No, he's not!
He's not dead!
He can't be!
What are you looking at?
Keep reading.
"ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos, domine.
"ut ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos".
"ut inimicos sanctae ecclesiae humiliare digneris, te rogamus audi"...
He will be!
Wait!
What?
!
He's not dead, but he will be after what we do to him.
How do we know you're telling the truth?
You don't.
- Sam!
- A building!
Okay?
- A building in Jefferson city.
- Missouri?
- Where, where?
An address.
- I don't know.
And the demon, the one we're looking for, where is it?
I don't know.
I swear.
That's everything.
That's all I know.
Finish it.
What?
I told you the truth.
I don't care.
You son of a bitch.
You promised.
I lied!
Sam?
Sam!
Read.
We can still use her, find out where the demon is.
- She doesn't know.
- She lied.
Sam, there's an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there.
We've got to help her.
You're gonna kill her.
What?
You said she fell from a building.
That girl's body is broken.
The only thing keeping her alive is that demon inside.
You exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.
Listen to me, both of you, we're not gonna leave her like that.
She is a human being.
And we're gonna put her out of her misery.
Sam, finish it.
Finish it.
"dominicos sanctae ecclesiae.
"terogamus audi nos.
"terribilis deus de sanctuario suo deus israhel
"ipse tribuite virtutem et fortitudinem plebi suae.

She's still alive.
Call 911.
Get some water and blankets.
Thank you.
Shh, shh, just take it easy, all right?
Come on.
Let's get her down.
Sorry, sorry.
I've got you.
I've got you.
It's okay.
It's okay.
A year.
What?
It's been a year.
Shh, shh, just take it easy.
I've been awake for some of it.
I couldn't move my own body.
The things I did...
It's a nightmare.
Was it telling us the truth about our dad?
- Dean.
- We need to know.
Yes.
But it wants... you to know that...
They want you to come for him.
If dad's still alive, none of that matters.
Where is the demon we're looking for?
Not there.
Other ones.
Awful ones.
Where are they keeping our dad?
By the r-river.
Sunrise.
"Sunrise"?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You better hurry up and beat it before the paramedics get here.
What are you gonna tell them?
You think you guys invented lying to the cops?
!
I'll figure something out.
Here.
Take this.
You might need it.
Thanks.
Thanks... for everything.
Be careful, all right?
Just go find your dad.
And when you do, you bring him around, would you?
I won't even try to shoot him this time.
You've been quiet.
Just getting ready.
He's gonna be fine, Dean.
Dude, what are you drawing on my car?
It's called a devil's trap.
Demons can't get through it or inside it.
So?
It basically turns the trunk into a lockbox.
So?
So we have a place to hide the colt while we go get dad.
What are you talking about?
We're bringing the colt with us.
We can't, Dean.
We've only got three bullets left.
We can't just use them on any demon.
We've got to use them on the demon.
No, we have to save dad, Sam, okay?
We're gonna need all the help we can get.
You know how pissed dad would be if we used all the bullets?
Dean, he wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
I don't care, Sam!
I don't care what dad wants, okay?
And since when do you care what dad wants?
We want to kill this demon.
You used to want that, too!
Hell, you're the one who came and got me at school!
You're the one who dragged me into this.
I'm just trying to finish it.
Well, you and dad are a lot more alike than I thought.
You know that?
You both can't wait to sacrifice yourself for this thing.
But you know what?
I'm gonna be the one to bury you.
You're selfish, you know that?
You don't care about anything but revenge.
That's not true, Dean.
I want dad back, but they are expecting us to bring this gun.
They get the gun, they will kill us all.
That colt is our only leverage, and you know it, Dean.
We cannot bring that gun.
We can't.
Fine.
- I'm serious, Dean.
- I said "fine," Sam.
Hey, hey.
I think I know what Meg meant by "sunrise".
Son of a bitch.
That's pretty smart.
If these demons can possess people, they can possess almost anybody inside.
Yeah, and make anybody attack us.
And so we can't kill 'em...
A building full of human shields.
They probably know exactly what we look like, too, and they could look like anybody.
- This sucks out loud.
- Yeah, tell me about it.
All right.
So, how the hell are we gonna get in?
Pull the fire alarm,
- get out all the civilians.
- Okay, but then the city responds in...
- what, seven minutes?
- Seven minutes, exactly.
Hey, what's happening?
Is it a fire?
We're figuring that out right now, sir.
Just stay back.
I got a yorkie upstairs, and he pees when he's nervous.
Sir, you have to stay back.
I always wanted to be a fireman when I grew up.
You never told me that.
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.
Hurry up!
Dad.
He's still breathing.
Dad, wake up.
Dad!
- Wait.
Wait.
- What?
He could be possessed, for all we know.
What, are you nuts?
Dean, we got to be sure.
Sam?
Why are you splashing water on me?
Dad, are you okay?
They've been drugging me.
- Where's the colt?
- Don't worry, dad, it's safe.
Good, boys.
Good, boys.
Hey, buddy, You can't go in.
Go!
Back, back!
Go!
Sam, let's go!
Sam!
Sam, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, we've got to get out of here.
How is he?
He just needed a little rest, that's all.
How are you?
I'll survive.
Hey, you don't think we were followed here, do you?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
I mean, we couldn't have found a more out-of-the-way place to hole up.
Yeah.
Hey, uh...
Dean, you, um...
You saved my life back there.
So I guess you're glad I brought the gun, huh?
Man, I'm trying to thank you here.
You're welcome.
Hey, Sam?
Yeah?
You know that guy I shot?
There was a person in there.
You didn't have a choice, Dean.
Yeah, I know.
That's not what bothers me.
Then what does?
Killing that guy, killing Meg.
I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.
For you or dad, the things I'm willing to do or kill, it's just...
This scares me sometimes.
It shouldn't.
You did good.
You're not mad?
For what?
Using a bullet.
Mad?
I'm proud of you.
You know, Sam and I, we can get pretty obsessed.
But you...
You watch out for this family.
You always have.
Thanks.
- It found us.
It's here.
- The demon?
Sam, lines of salt in front of every window, every door.
Already did it.
- Check it, okay?
- Okay.
- Dean, you got the gun?
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.
- Sam tried to shoot the demon in Salvation.
- It vanished.
- It's me.
I won't miss.
Now, the gun.
Hurry.
Son, please.
Give me the gun.
What are you doing, Dean?
He'd be furious.
What?
That I wasted a bullet.
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.
You're not my dad.
Dean, it's me.
I know my dad better than anyone, and you ain't him.
- What the hell has gotten into you?
- I could ask you the same thing.
Stay back.
Dean?
What the hell is going on?
Your brother's lost his mind.
- He's not dad.
- What?
I think he's possessed.
I think he's been possessed since we rescued him.
- Don't listen to him, Sammy.
- Dean, how do you know?
He's different.
You know, we don't have time for this.
Sam, if you want to kill this demon, you've got to trust me.
Sam?
No.
No.
Fine.
You're both so sure.
Go ahead.
Kill me.
I thought so.
What a pain in the ass this thing's been.
It's you, isn't it?
We've been looking for you for a long time.
Well, you found me.
But the holy water?
You think something like that works on something like me?
I'm gonna kill you!
Oh, that would be a neat trick.
In fact, here.
Make the gun float to you there, psychic boy.
Well, this is fun.
I could've killed you a hundred times today, but this...
This is worth the wait.
Your dad...
He's in here with me, trapped inside his own meat suit.
He says "hi," by the way.
He's gonna tear you apart.
He's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
- Let him go, or I swear to god...
- What?
What are you and god gonna do?
You see, as far as I'm concerned, this is justice.
You know that little exorcism of yours?
That was my daughter.
- Who, Meg?
- The one in the alley?
That was my boy.
You understand?
- You've got to be kidding me.
- What?
You're the only one that can have a family?
You destroyed my children.
How would you feel if I killed your family?
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.
I did.
Still, two wrongs don't make a right.
You son of a bitch.
I want to know why.
Why did you do it?
You mean why did I kill mommy and pretty little Jess?
Yeah.
You know, I never told you this, but
Sam was gonna ask her to marry him.
Been shopping for rings and everything.
You want to know why?
- Because they got in the way.
- In the way of what?
My plans for you, Sammy...
You...
And all the children like you.
Listen, you mind just getting this over with, huh?
'cause I really can't stand the monologuing.
Funny, but that's all part of your m. o., isn't it?
Mask all that nasty pain, mask the truth.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You know, you fight, and you fight for this family, but the truth is they don't need you.
Not like you need them.
Sam... he's clearly John's favorite.
Even when they fight, it's more concern than he's ever shown you.
I bet you're real proud of your kids, too, huh?
Oh, wait, I forgot.
I wasted 'em.
Dean!
No!
Dad!
Dad, don't you let it kill me!
Dean!
Dad, please.
Dean!
No!
Stop.
Stop it.
You kill me, you kill daddy.
I know.
Dean?
Dean?
Hey.
Oh, god, you lost a lot of blood.
- Where's dad?
- He's right here.
He's right here, Dean.
Go check on him.
Dad?
Sammy!
It's still alive.
It's inside me.
I can feel it.
You shoot me.
You shoot me!
You shoot me in the heart, son!
- Do it, now!
- Sam, don't you do it.
- Don't you do it.
- You've got to hurry.
I can't hold on to it much longer.
You shoot me, son!
Shoot me!
Son, I'm begging you!
We can end this here and now!
Sammy!
Sam, no.
You do this!
Sammy!
Sam, Sam...
"Bad Moon Rising" by Credence Clearwater Revival
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'.
I know the end is comin' soon.
Look, just hold on, all right?
The hospital is only 10 minutes away.
I'm surprised at you, Sammy.
Why didn't you kill it?
I thought we saw eye-to-eye on this.

You're never gonna see your father again.
They've got dad.
Meg?
What did she say?
I just told you, sammy.
Okay.
What are you doing, dean?
We got to go.
Why?
Because the demon knows we're in salvation.
It knows we've got the colt.
It's probably coming for us next.
We've still got three bullets left.
Listen, tough guy, we're not ready.
We don't know how many of them are out there.

He begged to see his sons one last time.
That's when i slit his throat.
"Ergo..."
For your sake, i hope you're lying.
'Cause if it's true, i swear to god,
I will march into hell myself,
And i will slaughter each and every one
Of you evil sons of bitches, so help me god.

Aah!
Where is he?
You just won't take "dead" for an answer, will you?
Where is he?
!
Dead!
No, he's not!
He's not dead!
He can't be!
What are you looking at?

He will be!
Wait!
What?
!
He's not dead,
But he will be after what we do to him.
How do we know you're telling the truth?
You don't.
Sam!
A building!
Okay?
A building in jefferson city.
Missouri?
Where, where?
An address.
I don't know.
And the demon
- Where is it?
I don't know.
I swear.
That's everything.
That's all i know.
Finish it.
What?
I told you the truth.
I don't care.
You son of a bitch.
You promised.
I lied!
Sam?
Sam!
Read.
We can still use her, find out where the demon is.
She doesn't know.
There's an innocent girl trapped somewhere in there.
We've got to help her.
You're gonna kill her.
What?
You said she fell from a building.
That girl's body is broken.
The only thing keeping her alive is that demon inside.
You exorcise it, the girl is gonna die.
We are not gonna leave her like that.
She is a human being.
And we're gonna put her out of her misery.
Sam, finish it.
Finish it.

Dean: she's still alive.
Call 911.
Get some water and blankets.
Thank you.
Shh, shh, just take it easy, all right?
Thank you.
Shh.
Come on.
Let's get her down.
Sorry, sorry.
I've got you.
I've got you.
It's okay.
It's okay.
A year.
What?
It's been a year.
Just take it easy.
I've been awake for some of it.
I couldn't move my own body.
The things i did
- It's a nightmare.
Was it telling us the truth about our dad?
Dean.
We need to know.
Yes.
But it wants... you to know
That...they want you to come for him.
If dad's still alive, none of that matters.
Where is the demon we're looking for?
Not there.
Other ones.
Awful ones.
Where are they keeping our dad?
By the r-River.
Sunrise.
"Sunrise"?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
You better hurry up and beat it
Before the paramedics get here.
What are you gonna tell them?
You think you guys invented lying to the cops?
I'll figure something out.
Here.
Take this.
You might need it.
Thanks.
Thanks...for everything.
Be careful, all right?
Just go find your dad.
And when you do, you bring him around, would you?
I won't even try to shoot him this time.
You've been quiet.
Just getting ready.
He's gonna be fine, dean.
Dude, what are you drawing on my car?
It's called a devil's trap.
Demons can't get through it or inside it.
So?
It basically turns the trunk into a lockbox.
So?
So we have a place to hide the colt while we go get dad.
What are you talking about?
We're bringing the colt with us.
We can't, dean.
We've only got three bullets left.
We can't just use them on any demon.
We've got to use them on the demon.
No, we have to save dad, sam, okay?
We're gonna need all the help we can get.
You know how pissed dad would be if we used all the bullets?
Dean, he wouldn't want us to bring the gun.
I don't care, sam!
I don't care what dad wants, okay?
Since when do you care what dad wants?
We want to kill this demon.
You used to want that, too.
Hell, you're the one who came and got me at school!
You're the one who dragged me into this.
I'm just trying to finish it.
Well, you and dad are a lot more alike than i thought.
You both can't wait to sacrifice yourself for this thing.
But you know what?
I'm gonna be the one to bury you.
You're selfish, you know that?
You don't care about anything but revenge.
That's not true, dean.
I want dad back,
But they are expecting us to bring this gun.
They get the gun, they will kill us all.
That colt is our only leverage, and you know it, dean.
We cannot bring that gun.
We can't.
Fine.
I'm serious, dean.
I said "fine," sam.
Hey, hey.
I think i know what meg meant by "sunrise."
Son of a bitch.
That's pretty smart.
If these demons can possess people,
They can possess almost anybody inside.
And make anybody attack us.
And so we can't kill 'em -
A building full of human shields.
They probably know exactly what we look like, too,
And they could look like anybody.
This sucks out loud.
All right, so, how the hell are we gonna get in?
Pull the fire alarm, get out all the civilians.
But then the city responds in seven minutes.
Seven minutes, exactly.
You okay?
Hey, what's happening?
Is it a fire?
We're figuring that out right now, sir.
Just stay back.
I got a yorkie upstairs, and he pees when he's nervous.
Sir, you have to stay back.
I always wanted to be a fireman when i grew up.
You never told me that.
This is the fire department.
We need you to evacuate.
Hurry up!
Dad.
He's still breathing.
Dad, wake up.
Dad!
Wait.
Wait.
What?
He could be possessed, for all we know.
What, are you nuts?
Dean, we got to be sure.
Sam?
Why are you splashing water on me?
Dad, are you okay?
They've been drugging me.
Where's the colt?
Don't worry, dad, it's safe.
Good, boys.
Good, boys.
Hey, buddy, you can't go in.
Go!
Back, back!
Go!
Sam, let's go!
Sam!
Sam!
Sam, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, we've got to get out of here.
How is he?
He just needed a little rest, that's all.
How are you?
[ Inhales deeply ] i'll survive.
Hey, you don't think we were followed here, do you?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
We couldn't have found
A more out-Of-The-Way place to hole up.
Yeah.
Hey, uh...
Dean, you, um...
You saved my life back there.
So i guess you're glad i brought the gun, huh?
Man, i'm trying to thank you here.
You're welcome.
Hey, sam?
Yeah?
You know that guy i shot?
There was a person in there.
You didn't have a choice, dean.
I know.
That's not what bothers me.
Then what does?
Killing that guy, killing meg.
I didn't hesitate.
I didn't even flinch.
For you or dad, the things i'm willing to do or kill,
It's just...
It scares me sometimes.
It shouldn't.
You did good.
You're not mad?
For what?
Using a bullet.
Mad?
I'm proud of you.
You know, sam and i, we can get pretty obsessed.
But you
- You watch out for this family.
You always have.
Thanks.
It found us.
It's here.
The demon?
Sam, lines of salt in front of every window, ever door.
Already did it.
Check it, okay?
Dean, you got the gun?
Yeah.
Give it to me.
Sam tried to shoot the demon.
It vanished.
I won't miss.
Now, the gun.
Hurry.
Son, please.
Give me the gun.
What are you doing, dean?
You'd be furious.
What?
That i wasted a bullet.
He wouldn't be proud of me.
He'd tear me a new one.
You're not my dad.
I know my dad better than anyone,
And you ain't him.
What the hell has gotten into you?
I could ask you the same thing.
Dean?
What the hell is going on?
Your brother's lost his mind.
He's not dad.
What?
I think he's possessed.
I think he's been possessed since we rescued him.
Don't listen to him.
Dean, how do you know?
He's different.
We don't have time for this.
Sam, if you want to kill this demon,
You've got to trust me.
Sam?
No.
No.
Fine.
You're both so sure.
Go ahead.
Kill me.
I thought so.
What a pain in the ass this thing's been.
It's you, isn't it?
We've been looking for you for a long time.
Well, you found me.
But the holy water?
You think something like that works on something like me?
I'm gonna kill you!
Oh, that would be a neat trick.
In fact, here.
Make the gun float to you there, psychic boy.
Well, this is fun.
I could've killed you a hundred times today, but this...
This is worth the wait.
Your dad
- He's in here with me,
Trapped inside his own meat suit.
He says "hi," by the way.
He's gonna tear you apart.
He's gonna taste the iron in your blood.
Let him go, or i swear to god -
What?
What are you and god gonna do?
You see, as far as i'm concerned, this is justice.
You know that little exorcism of yours?
That was my daughter.
Who, meg?
The one in the alley?
That was my boy.
You understand?
You've got to be kidding me.
What?
You're the only one that can have a family?
You destroyed my children.
How would you feel if i killed your family?
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.
I did.
Still, two wrongs don't make a right.
You son of a bitch.
I want to know why.
Why did you do it?
You mean why did i kill mommy and pretty, little jess?
Yeah.
You know, i never told you this,
But sam was gonna ask her to marry him.
Been shopping for rings and everything.
You want to know why?
Because they got in the way.
In the way of what?
My plans for you, sammy -
You...and all the children like you.
Listen, you mind just getting this over with, huh?
'Cause i really can't stand the monologuing.
Funny, but that's all part of your m.O., isn't it?
Mask all that nasty pain, mask the truth.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
You know, you fight, and you fight for this family,
But the truth is they don't need you.
Not like you need them.
Sam
- He's clearly john's favorite.
Even when they fight,
It's more concern than he's ever shown you.
I bet you're real proud of your kids, too, huh?
Oh, wait, i forgot.
I wasted 'em.
Aah!
Dean!
No!
Dad!
Dad, don't you let it kill me!
Dean!
Dad, please.
Dean!
No!
Stop.
Stop it.
You kill me, you kill daddy.
I know.
Dean?
Dean?
Hey.
Oh, god, you lost a lot of blood.
Where's dad?
He's right here.
He's right here, dean.
Go check on him.
Dad?
Sammy!
It's still alive.
It's inside me.
I can feel it.
You shoot me.
You shoot me!
You shoot me in the heart, son!
Do it, now!
Sam, don't you do it.
Don't you do it.
You've got to hurry.
I can't hold on to it much longer.
You shoot me, son!
Shoot me!
Son, i'm begging you!
We can end this here and now!
Sammy, you kill me!
Sam, no.
You do this!
Sammy!
Sam, sam...
I'm begging you, son.
You've got to.
I can't hold on to it much longer.
Shoot me!
Look, just hold on, all right?
The hospital is only 10 minutes away.
I'm surprised at you, sammy.
Why didn't you kill it?
I thought we saw eye-To-Eye on this.
Killing this demon comes first -
Before me, before everything.
No, sir, not before everything.
Look, we've still got the colt.
We still have the one bullet left.
We just have to start over, all right?
We already found the demon -
Alien.Autopsy.DVDRip.XviD-DoNE
(Woman) Hello, Qwerty Films?
Morgan Banner for Michael Kuhn.
-(Buzzer)
-Push the door.
That works.
Good.
Oh, great. lt's dark.
There's no lights here, so careful.
(Man) What is this story?
Michael wouldn't tell me who these people are or what their story is.
So, I don't know.
(Morgan) They're not here?
They'll be up in a minute.
Up in a minute?
I've travelled 4,000 miles for this meeting!
I know, I know, but they won't come up unless I phone them and tell them that you've signed this.
-lt's a confidentiality agreement.
-Jesus!
-l've had enough of this bullshit.
-Morgan, wait!
Michael, what do you think I do?
Just action.
Just... I make documentaries.
They put them in cinemas all over the world for millions of people to watch them.
-l don't make confidential films.
-l realise that.
But this...this thing... this thing these people have done, the thing that I want you to hear, they've kept it secret for ten years, they're not sure how many laws they broke doing it,
and they simply want to know that if you're not interested you won't tell their story to anyone else.
This had better be so good.
-(Footsteps) -(Man # 1 ) Right... (Man #1 ) I'll do all the talking, yeah?
(Man #2) Yeah... (Man #1 ) What are you talking about?
Don't exaggerate.
(Man #1 ) You've got to relax a bit more.
You're too uptight.
Careful!
(Knock on door)
Hi.
You all right?
Uh...my name's Ray Santilli.
-This is my friend, Gary Shoefield.
-All right?
You've...probably never heard of us, though, have you?
Correct.
Why don't you type Ray's name into Google, and see what happens?
-(Morgan) S-A-N-T-l...
-L-L-l.
How many hits?
Three million, nine hundred eighty two thousand... (All) Four hundred and seven.
Yeah.
( Supergrass.:
Alright)
Bet you want to hear their story now.
We are young
We run green Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights Feel alright
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag Put it out
See our friends, see the sights Feel alright
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around lf we like
But we're alright... (Phone)
-Gary, how you doing?
-How do you think I'm doing?
-You took my car.
-Calm down, Gary.
We discussed this.
Yes, Ray.
We discussed it, and I said no.
Gary, please. lt's only for one day.
Look, whatever you do, don't eat in the car.
OK, mate.
Hey, thanks, Gary.
I appreciate this.
-Ray!
- We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright...
-(Man) lf you suspect this is a pirated video...
-You up yet, Nan?
I'm putting the new Woody Harrelson on.
It's called Natural Born Killers.
I think you'll like it.
Just, er...don't stop it once it's started, will you?
-l'm taping it for a couple of friends.
-All right, sweetheart.
-l thought you wanted to watch the film.
-Maybe later, when I get back.
-Back from where?
-My date.
-Your date?
-His name's Maurice. I met him at bingo.
-Where's he taking you?
-Margate for the day.
Oh, I cannot wait.
I haven't been on a date in 47 years.
Now, just hold on. I don't know anything about this Maurice character and if you've just met him, you don't either.
I don't like this one little bit, Nan.
(Doorbell)
Ah...
-Oh, hello. I'm...
-Maurice.
Right.
-This is a first date, yes?
No funny business.
-l'm not sure I under... I want her back by four o'clock, or there'll be trouble.
(Nan) Raymond, go, please.
(Ray) Do we understand each other?
Four o'clock. I'll be waiting.
Nice one, Edgar.
-You get them Babe tapes?
-Yeah, plus a free GoldenEye.
(Ray) Come on, I've got cushions.
I've got pillows.
T-shirts of the The King.
What about you, my darling?
All the way from Vegas.
Oh...
So, are you saying this is a genuine Toy Story video?
Yes. I've got friends in the business.
They look after me.
-You got friends in Hollywood?
-Yeah.
Me and Mr Potato Head are like this.
-That's me on top there, look.
-Eh?
Got something for you.
Here you go, my friend.
Timecop, special edition.
Van Damme has never been better.
I don't want one of your stolen videos, thank you very much.
They're copied, with great care and attention by me.
-You'll have no problem.
-That's where you're right, Mr Santilli.
Islington Council Trading Standards Officer.
And it's you that's got the problem.
Oi!
Arrest him.
(He mouths)
-l told you on the phone, I can't help you.
-You're my lawyer!
I'm not your lawyer. I'm not anyone's lawyer... (Raises voice) ...because I'm not a lawyer.
I'm a clerk, in a legal department.
But they've impounded all me stock.
I have to get it back.
This month's sales are paying for my trip to America.
A buying trip that's gonna transform my whole business.
I'm sorry.
Please go now.
All right.
Help me out of this, and I'll cut you in as well.
You're sitting on my receipts.
I want you to leave.
You can't want to be a legal clerk for the rest of your life.
(Man) Gary, a word in your ear, please.
I'm not going to be.
(Man) Come on, chop-chop.
Come in, have a seat.
I wanted to have a word with you, Gary, because there's going to be an opportunity for a bright young individual that the firm is willing to send back to college to get their law degree and then put on a fast track to top management.
I had heard some rumours.
Because of your experience, your knowledge of this company, and the people working in this company, we wanted to ask you.
Really?
Who you'd choose.
Marcus or Rachel?
It's not easy, is it?
Who would you be more comfortable calling boss?
(Woman) Yes, sir, two portions?
OK.
(Man) You all right, mate?
Best thing that ever happened to you, Gary.
Now you know you've got no future there, tell 'em to shove it.
Look, how are you ever going to date a Page Three girl or drive a Pontiac GTO, working as a lawyer for a biscuit firm?
I don't care what you say, I'm not going to America with you.
Aren't you tired of playing it safe yet?
I mean, take a risk, bet on yourself.
Bet on myself?
Yeah!
-Maybe you're right.
-Course I'm right.
-Why do I need them?
-Exactly.
I could pay for myself to go to law school.
What?
Apply for a place myself, pay the fees myself.
-After we get back from America?
-l'm not going to America.
-But you haven't got any money.
-But I will have, though.
When I sell my car.
Do you have any idea what a mint condition, perfectly restored 1 97 4 Ford Capri goes for these days?
Ray, where's my car?
(Ray) I can sell Elvis stuff standing on my head.
Authentic memorabilia, that's the business we're going into.
You can't still be huffy about the car.
-Why not?
-But look what you've got in its place.
A stake in your own business.
And this time, we're going right to the top.
-Mm.
-Don't want your Sag Aloo?
-No.
-Wicked.
Cheers.
(Ray) The plan was perfect.
Elvis had given a concert in Cleveland in 1 954.
So, we stuck an ad in the local paper saying we were gonna be in town for a few days and we'd pay cash to anybody who had any old photos or, better still, film footage of the King himself performing there 40 years before.
Then the idea was we'd bring it all home, sell it for a fortune.
(Gary) Well, that was the idea.
Gary!
Gary, you've got to come and see this.
-This is Harvey.
-Hello.
(Whispers) Look!
Look at that.
It's the King, performing here 41 years ago.
And it's uncopyrighted.
So, you think you might be interested?
Uh, maybe...maybe.
Condition's not great.
-There's no sound, which is a problem.
-No sound. lt's a problem.
I'll tell you what, why don't we forget the whole thing?
Why don't you go and get some more punch, while I discuss this with my business partner?
Fine, fine.
(Both chuckle)
-Will it be expensive?
-No, I've got him in the palm of my hand.
(Gary) I feel so lonely, baby I feel so lonely
Since my baby left, ooh-ooh I found a new place to dwell, ooh-ooh
Down at the end of lonely street ls Heartbreak Hotel, oh, baby...
Jesus!
You scared the life out of me.
Hang on a minute. lf you've come back about the film, I'm sorry, you're too late.
-A deal's a deal.
-l'm fine with the deal.
You see... I have another piece of film I think you'll be interested in.
-Well, what is it?
-l don't have it with me.
But you've really got to see it, to understand.
-Did you just see that?
-What?
There's a shooting star, just there, right above us.
Yeah, but it's gone now.
Yeah... there are things up there so beautiful sometimes I've cried... just thinking about them.
Beautiful and terrible both.
Well, it's going to be a wild ride for you, Raymond.
Wild, wild ride.
After you.
(Door bangs shut)
This is it.
I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corps.
One night in 1 947... I was pulled out of bed and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where l was ordered to...film this.
(Morgan) All right, just a minute...
Can you say that again?
The film showed the autopsy of an alien being.
It was carried out at Roswell Air Base,
New Mexico in July 1 947.
And you saw the footage?
What did you think?
I didn't see it, you see. I'd had the early night, so I didn't go with him to Florida.
-Didn't you have jet lag?
-No, I drank too much punch, to be honest.
(Both) We had pretty strong punch.
Oh, do me a favour.
Do you have any idea what it would mean if this was actually true?
If you'd actually found documentary proof that man wasn't alone in the universe?
It would be the most important discovery in the history of mankind.
It would change everything forever.
You're telling me out of all the people on the planet you're the one who's been blessed with this discovery?
Isn't it brilliant?
(Sighs) I can't deal with this. I can't deal with another one of your fantastic lies.
But it's not a lie.
Just sell your imaginary film, give me my money back, and we won't talk about it again.
I can't.
Harvey wants $30,000 for the film.
-Where am I gonna get $30,000 from?
-l don't care.
I need an investor to put up the money.
You have to help me.
If you ask me, it wasn't an investor he needed, it was a nutcase who already believed this UFO nonsense.
Fortunately, just the right nutcase happened to share Gary's passion for cars.
(Gary) Lazlo Voros.
(Morgan) This guy was some kind of investor or something?
(Gary) No, he was a psycho Hungarian art dealer who had a booming coke business on the side.
He lived with his Jamaican boyfriend-cum-bodyguard in Belgravia.
I'd met him at a car show in Birmingham, 'cause we're both obsessed with Detroit muscle cars of the 1 97 0s.
And, frankly, he scared the shit out of me.
But Ray was desperate and Voros was a big fan of crop circles.
(Manic laughter)
(Ray) So, Gary made the call.
-Um...hi.
Are you, er...?
-Get in.
OK.
This had better be good, Mr Santilli.
(Muffled cries) ls there someone in the boot?
Just concentrate on telling me about this film.
Well, it's the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen.
Unbelievable.
There it is, in front of me, up on the screen.
Proof that there is life on other planets.
And all I need is thirty grand.
(Voros) Hm.
Why don't we get some air?
(Muffled cries and banging)
(Seagulls cry)
(Voros laughs)
Ah!
You know what I like about the heavens, Mr Santilli?
No.
-All that beauty.
You know what it is?
-No.
Just the remnants of a massive explosion.
Violence is everywhere, and I'm something of a connoisseur when it comes to violence.
(Click)
-(Seagulls cry)
-Are you lying to me about what's on this film?
-(Seagulls' cries intensify)
-No.
No, no.
I swear to you, everything I've told you is absolutely true.
-(Gunshot) -(Bird squawks)
(Splash)
I like you, Ray.
I really do.
You'll have the money tomorrow, in the morning.
(Ray) I...
I'm in pieces by this point.
I am the most scared I have ever been in my life.
-You got the money.
-Don't underestimate how scary it was.
-Oh, no, I'm not.
-lt was a really scary moment.
-But you got the money.
-But don't underestimate how scary... (Morgan) Hang on.
Hang on a minute.
-You got the money and...
-(Ray) We got the money.
-lt's all there?
-lt's all there.
It better be.
I don't want anybody knowing it was me who gave you this.
I'm not signing anything, I'm not banking this money, and there's nobody still alive that knows that I've got this film.
And...
I want it kept that way.
(Ray) That was it, I'd got it.
I'd just pulled off the deal of the century.
(Morgan) lf this is the most secret film in history why did the cameraman end up with it?
I don't get that part.
By mistake.
There are eight prints made of the film.
Four of them and the original negative were sent to Washington.
Three more were sent to Air Force Intelligence in Utah.
The final print goes with Harvey to Florida, where he's told it's going to be picked up.
A week later, the whole world of military intelligence is completely turned on its head.
-The Air Force splits from the Army.
-That's when that happened.
The OSS is broken up and restructured into the ClA.
(Ray) None of the cameraman's contact numbers work anymore.
A year later, the film in Florida still hadn't been picked up.
So, he hung onto it, thinking that some day somebody would just come and get it.
(Gary) But no one ever did.
-Right, OK.
Take a seat, Jasmine.
-(Jasmine) Ooh, sorry, excuse me.
I'm sure you've all heard something about the film that I've just brought back from Florida.
And I'm sure a lot of you think it's just old Ray, up to his old tricks, as usual.
(Laughter)
-Preston, get the curtains.
Run the film.
-Righto, mate.
-(Maurice) Get my specs...
-(Man) lt's a good build-up, mate.
-(Gary) Ready?
-(Preston) Here we go.
- Pah-pah pah-pah pah-pah...
-(Man) Eight, seven, six...
-(Jasmine) Five, four, three...
Just coming. lt's gonna take a minute.
Just coming.
is that it?
Hang on, what's happened to it?
This is fine.
The projector's working fine.
It's the film, I think.
No, that's not right.
-l told you this would be a laugh.
-No, that's not what I saw.
I saw American military bringing a body off the back of a truck.
-This body was an alien. lt was an alien.
-(They laugh)
The alien is just lying there, and then they cut it open and pull out all its guts.
You can see President Truman looking in the viewing glass.
-Excuse me, where's the Rank Film Lab?
-Down there, on your left.
On the left, thank you.
You don't believe me.
-Doesn't matter what I believe.
-lt matters to me.
I really appreciate this, Auntie P.
Jeffrey!
My nephew's got a problem with some film.
Ohh.
Walk this way.
Ah.
Ah-ah-ah.
Ah, look at that.
-1 940s Kodak safety stock.
-(Auntie P) ls it?
You know what the worst thing you can do to a film like this is?
Keep it in sealed containers in a high temperature, high-humidity environment for any length of time.
Well, it's been kept in that can, in a garage in Miami.
For 50 years.
There's your problem.
-(Groans) Smell that?
-(Auntie P) That's bad.
Sort of...vinegary.
That's the film eating itself.
Oh, yeah.
From the moment that can was opened the process will have started.
We'll do what we can but don't hold your breath.
Chances of rescuing anything from this film are virtually non-existent.
-lt was gone?
-(Gary) Yeah.
Meanwhile, I've got Lazlo Voros on the phone.
"Where's my film?
Where is my film?"
-All the time ringing.
-The guy who's had a revolver at my head.
-He's gonna kill me.
What do I tell him?
-The truth.
You've got no other choice.
Oh, really?
And how does that go?
"Hey, Lazlo, I've spent $30,000 of your money on a film that was fine when I saw it
"but now it's eaten itself."
(Thunderclap)
(Excited laughter)
(Man talks quietly and woman laughs)
(Excited laughter)
-(Laughter)
-Yes.
Oh, erm...hello, Raymond.
Don't you "Oh, hello, Raymond" me.
What's going on here?
-(Both) Nothing.
-l was just...
I was just leaving.
(Raucous laughter)
What happens with my nan in my house is my business.
-Whether you like it or not.
-Oh!
I tho...
I thought it was your nan's house.
That's beside the point.
How old are you, anyway?
A hundred and two.
Have you got a job?
Or a pension?
-l run my own business.
-Really?
Doing what exactly?
I make those.
My family's been making them for generations.
Harvey Nicks, Harrods, Selfridges...
There's not a shape or size or shop in London we haven't supplied at some point in the last 1 50 years.
It's the most perfect idea.
Last night the answer suddenly came to me.
Maurice can make us an alien.
Then I can film it.
-Film it?
-l know what I saw.
All we do is copy it.
You can't even take a photograph of your nan without cropping her head off.
-How are you gonna shoot an alien autopsy?
-Not me.
Melik.
-Melik runs a kebab shop!
-At weekends he shoots wedding videos.
( Stereo MCs.:
Step lt Up)
Preston can bring in some meat offcuts to be the internal organs.
Edgar does up corpses for open-casket funerals.
He can do make-up.
Jasmine's dad's in antiques.
She can source the props.
Hold on.
Where are you going to shoot this Oscar-winning production?
-Your sister's not back from Ibiza till Sunday.
-No.
-Her flat would be perfect.
-No!
This is never going to work.
Count me out.
Thanks, Gary.
And, hey, I appreciate it.
-Jasmine, we're making a movie.
-l'm not taking my top off again.
Or seeing what I see
Curves with destinations
Poetic symmetry
You cause an inflammation ln my anatomy, don't you see
Yeah, yeah, yeah You can send a forget-me-not
Yeah, yeah, yeah But I'll still reach up to the top
Yeah, yeah, yeah Until the last day that I drop
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To the left
To the right
Keep it going, keep it going, it's alright
To the left
And to the right
Step it up, step it up, it's alright
We want flesh
We want flesh
We want flesh
(Preston) All right?
- All you gotta do is bounce it...
-(Preston) Eurgh!
To see just what goes where
There ain't no way around it...
Can't you just tell me?
-l want to know if it's any good or not.
-(Melik) Any good?
You're working with the best.
-Show me.
-Here we go.
And...open them.
-l'm a genius.
-(All) Eh?
-(Gary) You what?
-l mean...you're a genius.
And you.
-All of you, just all genius...
-(Laughter)
Great.
That's just half of it.
Wait till you see the rest.
We've still got a couple of adjustments to make, but you'll get the basic idea.
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.
-Ta-da!
-(They gasp)
(Jasmine) Oh.
We remoulded an old maternity mannequin we used to make for Mothercare.
Added an extra finger to each hand, and extra toes.
And...see the skull?
Maurice has done it in a special latex, so we can peel the skin back on camera.
We got some mince and some pig's blood balled up in some lady's tights inside.
It'll look just like the exposed brain.
-(Maurice) Are the crash wounds right?
-They're perfect.
The whole thing is just...
exactly like what I saw on the film.
Exactly.
So, we're on, then?
For tonight?
-Yeah.
-Good.
Oh, cheer up, Gary.
Cheer up?
What do you expect?
I've got an alien lying with its arse in my sister's kitchen sink.
-(Ray) Ready?
-l just want to try something with the lights.
-(Jasmine) Would you turn the light...
-One second.
Oh, is that...actual blood?
-lt's pig's blood mixed with food dye.
-(Gary) Eh?
Got the rest of the guts in the corner, by the sofa.
And some flat rib.
Some boneless loin.
A few pounds of braising mince.
And 1 5 packets of sliced ham.
-What's the ham for?
-Sandwiches.
Yeah, I'm a hyphenate.
-Special effects...hyphen...
location catering.
-Right.
First positions, please, everyone.
-Hey, hey, hey!
Look!
-You want me to mop that up?
-Yeah.
-No, don't touch it!
That's well proper. lt looks authentic.
Are you the director?
No, me.
Thank you.
-Extras, could you clear the set, please?
-Good luck, darling.
I need to talk to the actors.
Right!
Boys.
This is your first look at the alien.
Opening scene.
You two?
You're at Roswell.
Area 51 .
So, what I want is a bit of pointing.
Bit of nodding.
You're a natural.
Exactly, just like that.
Bit of pointing, bit of nodding.
Loads of energy.
Remember that you are professionals.
You're excited professionals.
-OK.
Feel it.
First positions.
We'll do a take.
-(Gary) Ridiculous.
Put your hat on.
We'll start from here, then I'll call you in.
-OK.
And...
-lt's not on properly.
-Get off!
-...action!
is mine all right?
(Melik) Edgar, take your position.
That's good.
No, don't wave.
Muppet.
-Try that pointing thing you do.
-Like this?
Yeah, just like that. lt's wicked.
-Cooee!
-(Ray and Gary) Hi, Nan.
-Play with the belly.
-(Gary) This is ridiculous.
(Ray) Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
Stop crying.
Get on with it, will you?
Look, out the way!
-(Melik) Prod it.
-Not like that.
-l'm out...
-Let me do it, like this.
-You're the director now, are you?
-Shut up, we're shooting a movie here!
-Shut up.
-No, you shut up.
Cut!
You just ruined my shot.
(Gary) Nice leg of lamb, this.
-(Ray) Good traction on it, Preston.
-That'll be the mint sauce.
-(Ray) Nice one.
-This is good.
-Oh!
-(Jasmine) I don't believe it.
(Chuckles and sighs)
-lt's all right.
-(Gary) You all right?
(Jasmine) Eugh.
(Melik) That's it.
Ooh, yes, it's looking good.
-(Ray) That looks good.
-That's good.
-Would you like a biscuit?
-Nan!
(Melik) Don't worry, we'll deal with that in the cut.
Yeah, I will, as it happens.
is that a Jammie Dodger?
-(Ray) Get your fingers in there.
-That's all right.
Should we go for the heart next, Ray?
Keep it going.
What does he think he's doing?
-ls he taking the piss?
-Stop messing about!
And...action.
(Melik) Ray, come round the other side.
Sausage on a stick?
-Nan, please!
-Cut!
Cut!
For crying out loud!
-ls someone wrangling Ray's nan?
-Maurice...
-l can't hear you!
-He's got her in the kitchen.
-Keep her there.
Has Jasmine spritzed?
-No, just getting a refill.
OK, now, let's get down and dirty with the intestines.
Go on, Gary, get in there.
(Gary) What on earth is that?
It stinks.
Careful. I'm gonna use that in the shop tomorrow for some sausages and burgers.
(Jasmine) Eurgh.
(Ray) Careful.
(Melik) Right.
That's good.
(Ray) Easy.
Careful with these.
(Melik) God!
-l think it's too real.
-lt's a nice touch.
It's looking at me.
(Melik) OK, this is good.
Right, let's...
let's get ready to...
-...peel back the skin.
-(Gary) Got it, Ray?
(Ray) Yeah.
(Gary) lt looks like raspberry jelly.
(Ray) Yeah, it is raspberry jelly.
(Melik) Give it to Gary.
Make out like there's a real tough, tough bone there. lt's a tough skull.
(Gary) Like that?
(Ray) Go on.
There.
(Melik) That's good.
That's very good.
(Ray) Lovely.
Now, gently...place the brain on the tray.
-Right.
-Gently.
-(Gary) Ready?
-Yeah.
Oh, no!
Mind the brain!
(Gary) Ah... (Gary) Ah, the carpet!
-Cut!
Cut, cut, cut!
-(Gary) Ah...she's gonna kill us.
Don't worry, Gaz.
Put a bit of salt on that.
-Are you sure?
Isn't it salt and wine?
-No, it's for red wine you put...
-(Melik) lt's salt and white wine.
-Put a pot plant on it.
I don't know what else is in the skull so, Preston, please tell me it's gonna work.
Brain's sorted.
No more slippage.
(Melik) OK.
OK, good.
Action!
OK, easy does it, easy.
OK, ready, Ray?
Ready?
Wait!
Cut!
-What the hell is that?
-That would be the stuffed sheep's stomach.
Dash of garlic, 90 minutes at gas mark 4, a highly nutritious meal for a family of five.
That's great.
Our alien travels millions of light years across the universe with nothing but a haggis to guide him?
-lt's not slipping, though, is it?
-(Key in lock)
(Gary) Uh!
(He sighs)
Doreen!
How was Ibiza?
-(Ray) Now, Doreen, don't fly off the handle.
-(She gasps)
-lt's not what it looks like, OK?
-No.
I can explain everything.
Shall we call that a day?
-(Ray) lt won't fit.
-(Gary) lt will, just shove it in.
-What are we doing here?
-This was your idea.
I don't just mean this. I mean the shoot. I mean the whole thing. lt's a complete disaster.
It's not a complete disaster.
I mean, bits of it were quite good.
Bits of it?
-Would you show that film to Lazlo Voros?
-No.
No. I'm a dead man, aren't I?
Not necessarily.
You're the worst liar I have ever met.
Yeah, but that's the difference between you and me, Ray.
That's why you stand a chance with Voros.
Bet on yourself. lsn't that what you said?
-What?
-The bloody head doesn't fit.
(Dogs bark)
(Heavy Caribbean accent) ls what you a-look 'pon?
-Um...what?
-Voros ready to see you now.
Follow me.
(Sobbing)
Follow me.
Mr Voros, good evening.
Lovely to see you again.
If you speak to me again without being spoken to first, I will happily sit here flossing my teeth while Zachary is breaking every single bone in your body.
-Mm.
-ls that the film?
-Mm-hm.
-(Man sobs)
-( Tricky.:
Aftermath)
-Mm!
Zachary, darling?
Run it.
For one poor boy
There's someone
For he
For she
For one poor boy
There's someone...
Um...
Did...did you, er...?
The...
I mean, what did you...think?
Oh, God.
-Look, I'm sorry, Mr Voros.
-This is the most... beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
(Sobs)
We are not alone.
Ray, you proved it, once and for all.
You proved it.
( Tom Jones.:
If I Only Knew)
Thank you, Ray.
Yeah
Home grown, on the bone
All the channels show the same old war zone As I walk alone in the city
Making me an offer Now don't they look pretty...
-Yes!
-Hugged you?
Proper hugged me.
I still can't believe it myself.
You know what this means?
If Voros bought it, maybe other people will as well.
We should run off a few hundred copies for the cornershops who bought my Elvis videos.
If we got £1 0.99 a pop and shifted, say, a thousand of them, that'd be...
-Eleven grand.
-Eleven grand.
-So, I had this idea.
-l had the idea.
-Well...
-lt was...
Gary's idea was to invite all of the cornershop owners to a screening of the footage but do it somewhere impressive.
-To get the credibility up a little bit?
-Yeah.
See, I thought the grander the place was, the more excited the buyers might be and even start bidding against each other.
Raise the price.
And fortunately there was one very grand place who happened to have a room free.
The Natural History Museum.
-No way.
-Yeah, that's exactly what they said.
-Oh, not there?
-(Both) No.
-So, we had to find somewhere else.
-The Museum of London.
-Don't know that place.
-No, not many do.
But it was perfect.
They didn't ask too many questions.
The key thing was to keep the screening quiet.
-What you did is invite just a few?
-Yeah.
And apart from that we would keep it absolutely secret.
-(Crowd shouting)
-There's hundreds of people out there.
The Chief Constable is worried about losing control.
I don't care.
This is my screening and I'm not letting them in.
I'm not going to be blamed for causing a riot in front of the national press.
The national press are here?
The Sun, the Mirror, two television crews.
(Crowd) Let us in!
Let us in!
Not bad for a little press release to the local paper, eh?
You idiot!
There's no way this many people are gonna believe that film.
The national press'll see right through it.
It's a chance worth taking.
You can't buy publicity like this.
-(Klaxon) -l say we do it.
No.
Absolutely, categorically...
Yes, £5 a seat, madam.
Thank you, come on in.
(Tutting)
-You hear that?
-l can't hear anything.
Exactly.
They're not laughing.
( Audience gasps)
(Excited chatter)
(Shouting)
This just came in from London.
-Director know about this?
-He's waiting for you now, sir.
And the next day...
"ls it real?" "Man from Mars". "UFO".
Our alien, full of sausages, was on the front page of every newspaper around the world.
Raymond, there's a man on the phone from Argentina.
-Take a number, Nan. I'll call him back.
-Right.
-(Melik) I've got a woman from Italian TV.
-He cannot speak to you now...
-l'm going to have to get back to them.
-...but give me your number...
-l appreciate your interest.
-...and he will call you back.
-Can I call you back?
-That's us.
-No, I promise.
All right.
OK, bye-bye.
-Yes.
-That's us on the telly.
-lt's been like this all day.
Every TV station in the world wants our film, Gary.
-There's hundreds of them.
-Buenos dias.
Bye, pet.
I have absolutely no idea how we've done this.
But since we have, and it's the only opportunity we'll ever have to make any money at all,
-we have to do it right.
-That's what we are doing.
Make them compete against each other then sell the film to the highest bidder.
No, not the one highest bidder.
You sell it to the highest bidder in every territory round the world.
You're saying...
-...sell it over and over...
-And over again, yes!
We really are gonna be rich!
(Laughter)
( The Beloved.:
Sweet Harmony)
-l'm sorry, we're right in the middle of things.
-This will only take a moment.
Here you go.
is it right or wrong
Try to find a place
We can all belong
Be as one
Try to get on by lf we unify
We should really try...
Um...
AOB.
Any other business.
I'm thinking of letting Gary go.
Mm.
Seven days later, representatives from 1 1 4 television stations from around the world arrived in London ready to start negotiations.
So, we hired a room at a hotel near Heathrow...
-lt was a business suite.
-Yeah, with a little reception area.
We had free tea and coffee all day.
Photocopying machines.
I mean, we looked great.
We looked like a really professional outfit.
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now... (Gary) Loads of people turned up.
People from Argentina, Brazil, France, Japan...
Where else did they come from?
Germany, Argentina...
-You've said Argentina.
-Brazil?
Yeah.
-China didn't come, did they?
-Most people from...
Quite a few countries.
Time is running out Let there be no doubt
We should sort things out lf we care, like we say we do... I appreciate the offer, Mr González, and we'll give it our utmost consideration once we've seen the offers from the other bidders in Argentina.
You're talking to other TV stations from Argentina?
Three of them, yes, seem very keen.
-But, thanks for this.
-Send the next one in, please.
We don't have any more buyers from Argentina.
Wait a minute!
Let's come together
Right now
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together
Right now...
So, if you sign here...
Oui.
Thank you very much.
All I need now is your cheque.
Cheque?
He told me to bring cash.
In sweet harmony, let's come together...
Did he?
Right now, oh, yeah...
Excusez-moi.
In sweet harmony...
Why did you tell her she had to bring cash?
Have they all been bringing cash?
Look, Ray. I'm taking on the world with you.
UFO nutcases, Hungarian psychos, bring them on, but there is one thing I will never ever mess with and that's the Inland Revenue.
-The cash isn't about me fiddling my taxes.
-What is it about, then?
You said it yourself.
This might be the only time in our lives we get to make money like this and I just want to see it. I want to feel it, Gary, you know, I want to...
I want to touch it and smell it.
I know it sounds stupid but there it is.
Seven hundred and...
And forty-six thousand, nine hundred and ninety...
Seven hundred and forty-seven thousand dollars.
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now... (Morgan) Beautifull (Gary) We'd fooled the world.
-We were sitting on a good sum of money.
-Nice.
-(Ray) ln cash.
-Even nicer.
I mean, it was...it was all perfect.
And then things took a bit of a turn for the worse.
(Gary) Yeah, well, you see, I could have sworn I was being followed.
(Morgan) Are you alleging covert surveillance of Shoefield and Santilli by the US Military?
Your words, not mine.
(Morgan) Was there a cla file on them, then?
Almost certainly.
And, generally speaking, when there's a file there's surveillance.
Generally speaking.
-So, the US military thought the film was real?
-There's more to it than that.
Don't know who he is, but I keep seeing him.
It's starting to freak me out.
Do you know what it probably is?
Probably one of your weird ex-girlfriends.
-l don't have any weirdo ex-girlfriends.
-Oh, come on.
What about that one from Basildon?
Big girl, facial hair, ankles like lampposts.
-Janet.
-Janet!
That's the one.
-(Train rumbles)
-She hung around for weeks, didn't she?
-lt's not Janet.
-Look, whoever it is, put it out of your mind, at least for now.
Think about it.
In two days' time, our film goes out in ninety-eight countries around the world.
-We're going to be famous!
-You still don't get it.
Everyone on the planet is going to know we're liars.
Yeah... rich liars, though.
(Phone)
-(Train rumbles and clatters)
-Hello?
There was no deal allowing you to exploit the film and simply pay me a cut of the profits.
But there was.
We talked about it.
-That was the understanding.
-Not my understanding.
Unless you have, er...some signed paperwork that says otherwise.
(Whispers) Ray.
(Dog barks)
Now that we've cleared that up, let me spell things out for you.
I now control all the deals and we split any cash 80 to 20 to me.
I want to review any agreement you've already made and I alone will decide whether to approve them or not.
(Dog barking)
But...it's going out tomorrow night.
That would be a very grave mistake on your part.
(Dog barking)
(Growls and barks like a dog)
So, what did you do?
The only thing we could do.
We tried to pull the broadcast.
Which is when it happened.
What?
(Ray) Voros was in the middle of a crop circle looking up to the heavens hoping for some sort of close encounter, probably.
It just came out of nowhere.
Alien spacecraft?
No.
A green Land Rover.
-Knocked him over, killed him.
-Dead.
He was naked.
Are you saying that the US military intelligence had Lazlo Voros killed?
Think about it.
If there really was a genuine alien autopsy film, then when Ray Santilli popped up
US military would have been shitting their pants.
All of a sudden there's an extra print of a film that they had kept hidden for 50 years, a print they didn't even know existed.
The biggest secret in the history of the world's about to be blown wide open.
Then they see Santilli's film.
Once they realise the film's a fraud, that Ray's a fraud, then he and the film become the best possible smokescreen they could ever ask for.
All the time that people are looking at Ray Santilli and his stupid film they're not looking at them, and the real film.
They know that Ray's gonna be found out as a faker, which will just bury the truth even deeper, for even longer.
Or, of course, it could just have been an accident.
(Screams)
Do you ever wonder if there's someone up there, looking out for us?
Someone.
Or something.
(Ray) Widescreen.
Got it in specially... (Jasmine) I can't believe it.
This is so exciting.
Could you budge up, Skeletor?
-Here's Maurice.
-All right, lover boy?
(Nan) Raymond, did you set the video to record The X-Files?
-All sorted.
They put it on at the same time!
-l think it's a compliment, though.
I still can't believe that our little film is about to be shown in every continent on the planet.
-l know!
-Can you believe it?
-...based on all available information.
-lt's starting!
If what you are about to see is real, it's the most startling film footage in history.
Although we remain sceptical, some believe this is authentic footage of an alien life form.
Real or not, I must warn you, this appears to be an actual autopsy and some of the footage you will see is very gruesome.

(Frakes) Alien Autopsy.: fact or fiction?
Here outside Roswell is where the alleged crash happened some 50 years ago.
Was it a flying saucer?
Were there alien bodies on board?
People still come and look for some kind of clue.
But the evidence of the alien crash didn't come from here.
It was revealed halfway around the world.
What Santilli saw and purchased were reels of black-and-white film showing an autopsy being performed on a strange humanoid being.
The cameraman, who claims to have had a top military clearance told Santilli that in 1 947 he was flown urgently to Roswell where he filmed the recovery of several of these beings, both alive and dead, as well as the autopsy of one of them.
This could be the world's first look at an actual being from another planet.
The strange body appears intact except for an ugly wound on the right thigh.
Two mysterious doctors wearing contamination suits study its bizarre features.
What the fuck is that?
They are either pathologists or they are surgeons who have done a fair number of autopsies.
This supposedly was filmed in 1 947 and, while things haven't changed, we see some things that would have been expected at that time such as the use of a handsaw in removing the skullcap.
(Frakes) A third person wearing a mask watches from behind the glass partition.
is this indeed a top-secret military autopsy performed on an alien in 1 947?
(Man) This is a structure that must be the brain if it is a human being.
It looks like no brain that I have ever seen, whether it's a brain filled with tumour, a brain that has been radiated a brain that has been traumatised and is haemorrhagic...
What is this?
I would prefer to say for the time being that it is humanoid.
But I cannot say that it is a member of the human race as you and I know the human race.
What if?
What if?
What if the alien is real?
Let's consider.
He was an explorer, perhaps a scientist.
Crashed and died on a distant blue planet, light years from his home.
A frightened race of beings found his lifeless body, performed experiments and hid the results.
Why did he come to our planet?
What went wrong?
Obviously his own mission failed but in his death he may have delivered the most important message mankind has ever received.
We are not alone.
They believe it!
Gary, where have you been?
-What's happened?
-They believe it!
They only believe it!
-Right, you ready for this?
-(Cheering)
( Vic Reeves and the Wonderstuff.:
Dizzy)
Nan!
Have you seen these overnights?
Sh...
Dizzy I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl...
Have you seen these overnights?
(TV) ...surrounded a TV station that was about to broadcast the footage and confiscated the film.
time magazine has described the film, which has sent shock waves across the world and gained the biggest television audience since Live Aid, as the most important home movie since the Zapruder film.
Have you seen these overnights?
-lt's not possible.
-l know!
Clear the schedules.
We're running it again.
When?
Tonight.
(Reporters shout)
My God.
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy...
Bloody hell.
-Hundreds of them.
-(Knocking at door)
-(Doorbell)
-Forget about them.
Do you have any idea what happened to me last night?
-Don't tell me someone actually shagged you?
-Ha-ha (!
)
-(Phone)
-No, I had to barricade myself in my flat.
Five nutcases got up on the roof...
-(Doorbell) -...a load more tried to break in the front door, the phone hasn't stopped ringing for 1 2 hours.
-Everyone wants to see the original film.
-(Knock at door)
-That's fantastic.
-No, it isn't fantastic, because we don't have any film to show them.
The only film we ever did have was shot on modern film stock
-and that is still in Lazlo Voros's safe.
-(Doorbell repeatedly rung)
Maybe we could make another one.
You don't get this, do you?
This film means so much to so many people, Ray.
-Scary people, clinically disturbed people.
-(Knock at door)
Can you imagine what will happen if they ever find out it's a fake?
You know, strictly speaking, it's not actually a fake.
It's more of a remake.
You've got to remember that.
And you've got to relax a bit more, Gary.
Nobody's going to find out anything.
-What are you doing, anyway?
-Packing.
-For what?
-My trip to Argentina.
-What?
-l've been getting calls from chat shows in Buenos Aires, in Lima, Rio, yeah.
They want me to go over, all expenses paid.
-But you can't start going on chat shows.
-Why not?
Has nothing I've said made any sense to you?
They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.
-l can answer anything.
-Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.
-They can't keep changing.
-They won't.
-And how do you know they won't?
-Because I'm taking you with me.

The moon and the stars They all look down on me and say...
Would it be OK for me to sit here?
The guy next to me is a...snorer.
No, help yourself.
(Clears throat) OK, thank you.
(She clears throat)
You should, er...get yourself a drink.
It's free.
Oh!
(Speaks Spanish)
( Nouvelle Vague.:
Just Can't Get Enough)
(TV presenter speaks Spanish)
Mr Santilli, welcome back.
Now, the cameraman on this trip you made to the US...
He was a dangerous and highly volatile individual who, quite frankly, scared the living daylights out of most people he ever met.
(Speaks Spanish)
(Speaks Spanish)
( American accent) Put the cocktail down, son, or you'll be picking up your teeth with a broken arm.
-(Interviewer) ...cameraman says...
-(Ray) ...to this waiter, and I'm like,
"Hey, now, Manolitol
"Let's just cool our jets here, compadre.
"Otherwise you and me are taking this downtown."
Why can't you grasp this?
There's reporters everywhere.
They'll be checking every word.
Relax.
They're all enjoying it just as much as me.
-(Speaks Spanish) -(Gary) Hi.
-Hi.
-Right here at the front, Señor Santilli.
-You've been upgraded.
-Oh, thank you.
-l'm here.
-(Stewardess) Keep going.
-To the back, next to the toilets.
-(Baby cries)
-Señor Santilli.
-Oh, thank you.
(Gary) Ow!
Oh!
Hmph!
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough...
Well, hello, you.
No way!
-How are you?
-l'm great, how are you?
Are you following me around?
You got me.
Oh, wait, OK.
-Oooh!
-Oh, here we go.
Oh, thank you very much.
(Both) Cheers.
Hey... (Woman) Oh, Rayl Oh, Ray, Rayl
Rayl
Ooh, yesl Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.
Ohl Yesl -(Ray) Oohl Ohl Ohl
(Woman) No.
Oh.
(They scream and shout)
Pack it in, Santilli!
(Woman) Come on, baby.
Right, I swear to God, if you don't pack it in, I'm going to kill you!
-(Ray) Shh-shh-shhl -(Woman laughs) You be quietl
At last.
(Ray) Amber.
Pretty girl, actually, she was.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
How did that feel?
Having the attention?
You're a celebrity at this point, right?
I didn't like it.
I thought you enjoyed it too much.
Yeah, I mean, I did.
It comes with the territory.
You didn't have to do that, though.
That just drew attention to us.
-No, I think you have to do that.
-Hard to resist, isn't it?
The whole fame thing, I could take it or leave it.
You did too many, wouldn't you say?
You've probably done a few too many chat shows?
Yeah?
( Applause and cheering)
OK, OK, so we're back.
And you were telling me you hooked up at the Plaza Hotel?
That's right, yeah.
Me and Donald Trump, like that.
(Chuckles) That's me on top.
Well, OK, I just...have one final question.
Why have you never produced the original film so it can be verified?
-Excuse me?
The original footage?
-Mm-hm.
Ha!
Exactly.
Answer that, you brainless bloody spanner.
-Er...
-(Man) Where's the original, pal?
-lt's a simple enough question.
-(Loud thud)
-Yeah, yeah.
-Where is it?
Why don't you show it?
(TV off)
-What are you doing?
-(She cries out)
That's Ray's stuff.
Ah, here.
I was looking for a cigarette.
Are you a journalist?
(Gary) What did I tell you?
What did I say?
"Don't do it, Ray." l said, "Don't go on chat shows.
They'll have reporters everywhere."
Do you have any idea how exhausting it is always being right and never being listened to?
When you get angry like this you've got a little vein that pops up...
Shut up!
Thanks to Casanova here, some of the TV stations could sue us for breach of contract.
If they do, the rest'll follow and we'll end up broke and in prison.
-What you talking about, prison?
-No, no, no, no. lt's all right.
Preston?
-Anyone want the last pink wafer?
-So, what do we do?
Well, the only chance we've got is for everyone to stay absolutely silent.
From now on, no one says anything to anyone.
OK?
If we can all do that, then there's just a chance this story'll blow itself out and we can all quietly get on with the rest of our lives.
Quietly's good.
I like quietly.
He's a weirdo. I told you so.
Hey, you know what else we could all do quietly, don't you?
That is just what we need, another biscuit.
We could all, really quietly spend some of this lovely money.
(Laughter)
No.
No.
No.
-Why not?
-Because it's like we've robbed a bank.
-And the one thing any robber knows...
-Never spend the money too soon.
He's right.
Exactly. lt just draws attention to yourself.
Look, if we want to get away with this, we're gonna have to wait till everything dies down.
No more talk about the money till I say so.
When did your say-so become so much more important than...say, my say-so?
(Snorts)
(Door shuts)
-(Laser fire)
-Yaaahhhl
(Knock at door)
-Who is it?
-(Woman) Hello?
-(Knock at door)
-Wait a minute.
Hi.
Hi, there.
Thank you.
Hi, I'm Amber Fuentes from Channel Five News and we are looking for a Harvey Jarrold and we feel that he may live somewhere around here.
Oh, Harvey, yeah. I'll see if he's available.
-Well, maybe we could wait inside.
-No.
Come on!
Stupid idiots!
Slimy bastards.
Gary!
Gary!
Gary?
Gary?
There you are.
You've got to help me.
I'm not talking to you, Ray.
-Where have you been?
-Doing my laundry.
-We're in real trouble here, Gary.
-Shoes!
Sorry, sorry.
(Hoover on)
(Hoover off)
-Are you listening now?
-What?
The press have found Harvey.
Oh.
Now I'm in the middle of God knows where hiding out like a cheap crook, all because of that pile of horse shit you're peddling as my film!
You get rid of that bitch within 48 hours.
And if any other reporters show up,
-l'll blow the whistle on all your asses.
-(Horn blares)
Bastards!
(Morgan) You were busted.
(Ray) Yeah.
So, effectively, the game was up.
There was only one thing I could do.
Kill yourself?
(Both) No.
-He's offering us what?
-An exclusive interview.
-With the cameraman who shot the...
-Actual footage.
Clear the schedules.
But how were you gonna get an interview from a guy that didn't want to be interviewed?
-(Gary) What about him?
-(Ray) No, not old enough.
Hey, look.
That guy.
No, not right.
Him?
(Tyres screech)
Excuse me.
How would you like to make $500 and have a night in a clean hotel room?
What do I have to do?
Just...
learn these lines and say them in front of a camera.
During the Second World War, I was a combat photo... (Coughs) ...tographer for the United States Air Force, a few months after getting...
-Whoa!
-Too much, I know.
...flown to an airbase I'd never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be Ros...well.
I was a combat photographer for the...
United States Airforce.
A few months after my return home from Europe I was rudely awakened in the early hours of the morning and I was flown through the night to an airbase that I had never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be in Roswell, New Mexico.
Shit.
And there in Roswell, I was ordered to film an autopsy being performed... (Sighs) ...on a wretched alien creature apparently extracted from a crashed UFO.
Who the fuck is that?
I'll never forget it.
The stench was unbearable, although I suppose we didn't smell that wonderful to them.
Others of his like were in the back...
-This guy's good.
-This guy's better than Harvey.
Turns out, he used to be an actor.
-An actor?
Perfect.
-Yeah!
He'd made two movies with Lionel Barrymore in 1 935, then after that started drinking.
When we met him, he hadn't had an acting gig in about 40 years.
-You're lucky.
You're very, very lucky.
-Very, very, very.
And there we were sitting upstairs in my nan's house with seven hundred and forty-seven thousand US dollars in a pile like that.
-Bigger, even.
-lt was probably like that.
On my bed.
And, one seventh of it is yours.
Ninety-seven thousand dollars.
There you are, Gary.
Merry Christmas.
Ha-ha!
Thanks.
A seventh of 7 47,000 is about 1 06,700, Ray.
is it?
I know!
Look, I had it all ready for you!
-Get out!
-l did!
You expect me to believe that?
You know what?
I have just one more question.
What was it that you actually saw on the film in Miami?
I mean, there's no way that it was an alien.
So, what was it that gave you the idea?
-l told you.
No one ever believes me.
-Leave it to me.
There's one tiny bit of the story we haven't told you about yet.
-(Doorbell)
-Ah!
-lt's the guy from the film lab.
-Yeah.
And according to him, he'd managed to recover some of the image.
Right.
(Voice echoes) I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corp.
One night in 1 947, I was pulled out of bed
and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where l was ordered to... film this.
Film this.
Film this.
One night in 1 947...
One night in 1 947 to an airbase I'd never heard of...
Told you.
(Snorts)
You know something?
I don't think I can go through this again.
(Snorts) Me neither.
( The Monkees.:
I'm A Believer) I thought love was only true in fairytales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
(Ray) That was ten years ago.
(Morgan) And this has never been exposed?
(Morgan) The world doesn't know this?
(Ray) No.
Until now.
So, the film is still there?
-Right?
-Yeah.
Well, let's go get it.
Michael!
Getting it is exactly what we're gonna do, Morgan.
Just as soon as you've signed this brief deal memo.
What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Oh, then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love...
-l thought you birds was good at multi-tasking.
-l am. I walk and talk and live with you.
Ohl
Sorry there. lt's just instinct.
Looks good, though.
First civilian reaction.
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
(Man on TV) I'll never forget it.
Fucking guy doesn't even look like me!
Then I saw her face...
One can't help but wonder what there is out there.
...of doubt in my mind I'm in love
Maybe we both should have a cigarette?
Eh?
Yes, I saw her face...
-Would you like a biscuit?
-Not now, thank you.
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Said I'm a believer...
But as it rolled out around the world, one of the things that...didn't come back to haunt us but was quite entertaining was that the cameraman who'd sold it to Ray, he had a view that Ray was a foreigner and that selling it to him was the last he'd ever hear of it.

Ray, bless his heart, would sell anything that he felt would turn a profit.
That's not entirely true.
-That's not entirely true
-That is true.
(Woman) Hello, Qwerty Films?
Morgan Banner for Michael Kuhn.
- (Buzzer)
- Push the door.
That works.
Good.
Oh, great.
It's dark.
There's no lights here, so careful.
(Man) What is this story?
.
Michael wouldn't tell me who these people are or what their story is.
So, I don't know.
(Morgan) They're not here?
.
They'll be up in a minute.
Up in a minute?
.
I've travelled 4,000 miles for this meeting!
I know, I know, but they won't come up unless I phone them and tell them that you've signed this.
- It's a confidentiality agreement.
- Jesus!
- I've had enough of this bullshit.
- Morgan, wait!
Michael, what do you think I do?
.
Just action.
Just...
I make documentaries.
They put them in cinemas all over the world for millions of people to watch them.
- I don't make confidential films.
- I realise that.
But this...this thing... this thing these people have done, the thing that I want you to hear, they've kept it secret for ten years, they're not sure how many laws they broke doing it,
and they simply want to know that if you're not interested you won't tell their story to anyone else.
This had better be so good.
- (Footsteps) - (Man # 1) Right... (Man #1) I'll do all the talking, yeah?
.
(Man #2) Yeah... (Man #1) What are you talking about?
.
Don't exaggerate.
(Man #1) You've got to relax a bit more.
You're too uptight.
Careful!

Hi.
You all right?
.
Uh...my name's Ray Santilli.
- This is my friend, Gary Shoefield.
- All right?
.
You've...probably never heard of us, though, have you?

Correct.
Why don't you type Ray's name into Google, and see what happens?

- I'm taping it for a couple of friends.
- All right, sweetheart.
- I thought you wanted to watch the film.
- Maybe later, when I get back.
- Back from where?
.
- My date.
- Your date?
.
- His name's Maurice.
I met him at bingo.
- Where's he taking you?
.
- Margate for the day.
Oh, I cannot wait.
I haven't been on a date in 47 years.
Now, just hold on.
I don't know anything about this Maurice character and if you've just met him, you don't either.
I don't like this one little bit, Nan.
(Doorbell)
Ah...
- Oh, hello.
I'm...
- Maurice.
Right.
- This is a first date, yes?
.
No funny business.
- I'm not sure I under...

(Nan) Raymond, go, please.
(Ray) Do we understand each other?
.

I'll be waiting.

- You get them Babe tapes?
.
- Yeah, plus a free GoldenEye.

I've got pillows.
T-shirts of the The King.
What about you, my darling?
.
All the way from Vegas.
Oh...
So, are you saying this is a genuine Toy Story video?
.
Yes.
I've got friends in the business.
They look after me.
- You got friends in Hollywood?
.
- Yeah.

- That's me on top there, look.
- Eh?
.
Got something for you.
Here you go, my friend.
Timecop, special edition.

I don't want one of your stolen videos, thank you very much.

- You'll have no problem.

Islington Council Trading Standards Offiicer.
And it's you that's got the problem.
Oi!
Arrest him.
(He mouths)
- I told you on the phone, I can't help you.
- You're my lawyer!
I'm not your lawyer.
I'm not anyone's lawyer... (Raises voice)...because I'm not a lawyer.
I'm a clerk, in a legal department.
But they've impounded all me stock.
I have to get it back.
This month's sales are paying for my trip to America.
A buying trip that's gonna transform my whole business.
I'm sorry.
Please go now.
All right.
Help me out of this, and I'll cut you in as well.
You're sitting on my receipts.
I want you to leave.
You can't want to be a legal clerk for the rest of your life.
(Man) Gary, a word in your ear, please.
I'm not going to be.
(Man) Come on, chop-chop.
Come in, have a seat.
I wanted to have a word with you, Gary, because there's going to be an opportunity for a bright young individual that the firm is willing to send back to college to get their law degree and then put on a fast track to top management.
I had heard some rumours.
Because of your experience, your knowledge of this company, and the people working in this company, we wanted to ask you.
Really?
.
Who you'd choose.
Marcus or Rachel?
.
It's not easy, is it?
.
Who would you be more comfortable calling boss?
.
(Woman) Yes, sir, two portions?
.
OK.
(Man) You all right, mate?
.
Best thing that ever happened to you, Gary.
Now you know you've got no future there, tell 'em to shove it.
Look, how are you ever going to date a Page Three girl or drive a Pontiac GTO, working as a lawyer for a biscuit firm?
.
I don't care what you say, I'm not going to America with you.
Aren't you tired of playing it safe yet?
.
I mean, take a risk, bet on yourself.
Bet on myself?
.
Yeah!
- Maybe you're right.
- Course I'm right.
- Why do I need them?
.
- Exactly.
I could pay for myself to go to law school.
What?
.
Apply for a place myself, pay the fees myself.
- After we get back from America?
.
- I'm not going to America.
- But you haven't got any money.
- But I will have, though.
When I sell my car.
Do you have any idea what a mint condition, perfectly restored 1974 Ford Capri goes for these days?
.
Ray, where's my car?
.
(Ray) I can sell Elvis stuff standing on my head.
Authentic memorabilia, that's the business we're going into.
You can't still be huffy about the car.
- Why not?
.
- But look what you've got in its place.
A stake in your own business.
And this time, we're going right to the top.
- Mm.
- Don't want your Sag Aloo?
.
- No.
- Wicked.
Cheers.
(Ray) The plan was perfect.
Elvis had given a concert in Cleveland in 1954.
So, we stuck an ad in the local paper saying we were gonna be in town for a few days and we'd pay cash to anybody who had any old photos or, better still, film footage of the King himself performing there 40 years before.
Then the idea was we'd bring it all home, sell it for a fortune.
(Gary) Well, that was the idea.
Gary!
Gary, you've got to come and see this.
- This is Harvey.
- Hello.
(Whispers) Look!
Look at that.
It's the King, performing here 41 years ago.
And it's uncopyrighted.
So, you think you might be interested?
.
Uh, maybe...maybe.
Condition's not great.
- There's no sound, which is a problem.
- No sound.
It's a problem.
I'll tell you what, why don't we forget the whole thing?
.
Why don't you go and get some more punch, while I discuss this with my business partner?
.
Fine, fine.
(Both chuckle)
- Will it be expensive?
.
- No, I've got him in the palm of my hand.
(Gary) @ I feel so lonely, baby
@ I feel so lonely
@ Since my baby left, ooh-ooh
@ I found a new place to dwell, ooh-ooh
@ Down at the end of lonely street
@ Is Heartbreak Hotel, oh, baby...
Jesus!
You scared the life out of me.
Hang on a minute.
If you've come back about the film, I'm sorry, you're too late.
- A deal's a deal.
- I'm fine with the deal.
You see...
I have another piece of film I think you'll be interested in.
- Well, what is it?
.
- I don't have it with me.
But you've really got to see it, to understand.
- Did you just see that?
.
- What?
.
There's a shooting star, just there, right above us.
Yeah, but it's gone now.
Yeah... there are things up there so beautiful sometimes I've cried... just thinking about them.
Beautiful and terrible both.
Well, it's going to be a wild ride for you, Raymond.
Wild, wild ride.
After you.
(Door bangs shut)
This is it.
I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corps.
One night in 1947...
I was pulled out of bed and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where I was ordered to...film this.
(Morgan) All right, just a minute...
Can you say that again?
.
The film showed the autopsy of an alien being.
It was carried out at Roswell Air Base,
New Mexico in July 1 947.
And you saw the footage?
.
What did you think?
.
I didn't see it, you see.
I'd had the early night, so I didn't go with him to Florida.
- Didn't you have jet lag?
.
- No, I drank too much punch, to be honest.
(Both) We had pretty strong punch.
Oh, do me a favour.
Do you have any idea what it would mean if this was actually true?
.
If you'd actually found documentary proof that man wasn't alone in the universe?
.
It would be the most important discovery in the history of mankind.
It would change everything forever.
You're telling me out of all the people on the planet you're the one who's been blessed with this discovery?
.
Isn't it brilliant?
.
(Sighs) I can't deal with this.
I can't deal with another one of your fantastic lies.
But it's not a lie.
Just sell your imaginary film, give me my money back, and we won't talk about it again.
I can't.
Harvey wants $30,000 for the film.
- Where am I gonna get $30,000 from?
.
- I don't care.
I need an investor to put up the money.
You have to help me.
If you ask me, it wasn't an investor he needed, it was a nutcase who already believed this UFO nonsense.
Fortunately, just the right nutcase happened to share Gary's passion for cars.
(Gary) Lazlo Voros.
(Morgan) This guy was some kind of investor or something?
.
(Gary) No, he was a psycho Hungarian art dealer who had a booming coke business on the side.
He lived with his Jamaican boyfriend-cum-bodyguard in Belgravia.
I'd met him at a car show in Birmingham, 'cause we're both obsessed with Detroit muscle cars of the 1 970s.
And, frankly, he scared the shit out of me.
But Ray was desperate and Voros was a big fan of crop circles.
(Manic laughter)
(Ray) So, Gary made the call.
- Um... hi.
Are you, er...?
.
- Get in.
OK.
This had better be good, Mr Santilli.
(Muffled cries)
Is there someone in the boot?
.
Just concentrate on telling me about this film.
Well, it's the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen.
Unbelievable.
There it is, in front of me, up on the screen.
Proof that there is life on other planets.
And all I need is thirty grand.
(Voros) Hm.
Why don't we get some air?
.
(Muffled cries and banging)
(Seagulls cry)
(Voros laughs)
Ah!
You know what I like about the heavens, Mr Santilli?
.
No.
- All that beauty.
You know what it is?
.
- No.
Just the remnants of a massive explosion.
Violence is everywhere, and I'm something of a connoisseur when it comes to violence.
(Click)
- (Seagulls cry)
- Are you lying to me about what's on this film?
.
- (Seagulls' cries intensify)
- No.
No, no.
I swear to you, everything I've told you is absolutely true.
- (Gunshot) - (Bird squawks)
(Splash)
I like you, Ray.
I really do.
You'll have the money tomorrow, in the morning.
(Ray) I...
I'm in pieces by this point.
I am the most scared I have ever been in my life.
- You got the money.
- Don't underestimate how scary it was.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- It was a really scary moment.
- But you got the money.
- But don't underestimate how scary... (Morgan) Hang on.
Hang on a minute.
- You got the money and...
- (Ray) We got the money.
- It's all there?
.
- It's all there.
It better be.
I don't want anybody knowing it was me who gave you this.
I'm not signing anything, I'm not banking this money, and there's nobody still alive that knows that I've got this film.
And...
I want it kept that way.
(Ray) That was it, I'd got it.
I'd just pulled off the deal of the century.
(Morgan) If this is the most secret film in history why did the cameraman end up with it?
.
I don't get that part.
By mistake.
There are eight prints made of the film.
Four of them and the original negative were sent to Washington.
Three more were sent to Air Force Intelligence in Utah.
The final print goes with Harvey to Florida, where he's told it's going to be picked up.
A week later, the whole world of military intelligence is completely turned on its head.
- The Air Force splits from the Army.
- That's when that happened.
The OSS is broken up and restructured into the ClA.
(Ray) None of the cameraman's contact numbers work anymore.
A year later, the film in Florida still hadn't been picked up.
So, he hung onto it, thinking that some day somebody would just come and get it.
(Gary) But no one ever did.
- Right, OK.
Take a seat, Jasmine.
- (Jasmine) Ooh, sorry, excuse me.
I'm sure you've all heard something about the film that I've just brought back from Florida.
And I'm sure a lot of you think it's just old Ray, up to his old tricks, as usual.
(Laughter)
- Preston, get the curtains.
Run the film.
- Righto, mate.
- (Maurice) Get my specs...
- (Man) It's a good build-up, mate.
- (Gary) Ready?
.
- (Preston) Here we go.
- @ Pah-pah pah-pah pah-pah...
- (Man) Eight, seven, six...
- (Jasmine) Five, four, three...
Just coming.
It's gonna take a minute.
Just coming.
Is that it?
.
Hang on, what's happened to it?
.
This is fine.
The projector's working fine.
It's the film, I think.
No, that's not right.
- I told you this would be a laugh.
- No, that's not what I saw.
I saw American military bringing a body offi the back of a truck.
- This body was an alien.
It was an alien.
- (They laugh)
The alien is just lying there, and then they cut it open and pull out all its guts.
You can see President Truman looking in the viewing glass.
- Excuse me, where's the Rank Film Lab?
.
- Down there, on your left.
On the left, thank you.
You don't believe me.
- Doesn't matter what I believe.
- It matters to me.
I really appreciate this, Auntie P.
Jeffirey!
My nephew's got a problem with some film.
Ohh.
Walk this way.
Ah.
Ah-ah-ah.
Ah, look at that.
- 1 940s Kodak safety stock.
- (Auntie P) Is it?
.
You know what the worst thing you can do to a film like this is?
.
Keep it in sealed containers in a high temperature, high-humidity environment for any length of time.
Well, it's been kept in that can, in a garage in Miami.
For 50 years.
There's your problem.
- (Groans) Smell that?
.
- (Auntie P) That's bad.
Sort of...vinegary.
That's the film eating itself.
Oh, yeah.
From the moment that can was opened the process will have started.
We'll do what we can but don't hold your breath.
Chances of rescuing anything from this film are virtually non-existent.
- It was gone?
.
- (Gary) Yeah.
Meanwhile, I've got Lazlo Voros on the phone.
"Where's my film?
.
Where is my film?"
- All the time ringing.
- The guy who's had a revolver at my head.
- He's gonna kill me.
What do I tell him?
.
- The truth.
You've got no other choice.
Oh, really?
.
And how does that go?
.
"Hey, Lazlo, I've spent $30,000 of your money on a film that was fine when I saw it
"but now it's eaten itself."
(Thunderclap)
(Excited laughter)
(Man talks quietly and woman laughs)
(Excited laughter)
- (Laughter)
- Yes.
Oh, erm...hello, Raymond.
Don't you "Oh, hello, Raymond" me.
What's going on here?
.
- (Both) Nothing.
- I was just...
I was just leaving.
(Raucous laughter)
What happens with my nan in my house is my business.
- Whether you like it or not.
- Oh!
I tho...
I thought it was your nan's house.
That's beside the point.
How old are you, anyway?
.
A hundred and two.
Have you got a job?
.
Or a pension?
.
- I run my own business.
- Really?
.
Doing what exactly?
.
I make those.
My family's been making them for generations.
Harvey Nicks, Harrods, Selfridges...
There's not a shape or size or shop in London we haven't supplied at some point in the last 1 50 years.
It's the most perfect idea.
Last night the answer suddenly came to me.
Maurice can make us an alien.
Then I can film it.
- Film it?
.
- I know what I saw.
All we do is copy it.
You can't even take a photograph of your nan without cropping her head offi.
- How are you gonna shoot an alien autopsy?
.
- Not me.
Melik.
- Melik runs a kebab shop!
- At weekends he shoots wedding videos.
(@ Stereo MCs:
Step It Up)
Preston can bring in some meat officuts to be the internal organs.
Edgar does up corpses for open-casket funerals.
He can do make-up.
Jasmine's dad's in antiques.
She can source the props.
Hold on.
Where are you going to shoot this Oscar-winning production?
.
- Your sister's not back from Ibiza till Sunday.
- No.
- Her flat would be perfect.
- No!
This is never going to work.
Count me out.
Thanks, Gary.
And, hey, I appreciate it.
- Jasmine, we're making a movie.
- I'm not taking my top offi again.

@ To see just what goes where
@ There ain't no way around it...
Can't you just tell me?
.
- I want to know if it's any good or not.
- (Melik) Any good?
.
You're working with the best.
- Show me.
- Here we go.
And...open them.
- I'm a genius.
- (All) Eh?
.
- (Gary) You what?
.
- I mean...you're a genius.
And you.
- All of you, just all genius...
- (Laughter)
Great.
That's just half of it.
Wait till you see the rest.
We've still got a couple of adjustments to make, but you'll get the basic idea.
- Are you ready?
.
- Yeah.
- Ta-da!
- (They gasp)
(Jasmine) Oh.
We remoulded an old maternity mannequin we used to make for Mothercare.
Added an extra finger to each hand, and extra toes.
And...see the skull?
.
Maurice has done it in a special latex, so we can peel the skin back on camera.
We got some mince and some pig's blood balled up in some lady's tights inside.
It'll look just like the exposed brain.
- (Maurice) Are the crash wounds right?
.
- They're perfect.
The whole thing is just...
exactly like what I saw on the film.
Exactly.
So, we're on, then?
.
For tonight?
.
- Yeah.
- Good.
Oh, cheer up, Gary.
Cheer up?
.
What do you expect?
.
I've got an alien lying with its arse in my sister's kitchen sink.
- (Ray) Ready?
.
- I just want to try something with the lights.
- (Jasmine) Would you turn the light...
- One second.
Oh, is that...actual blood?
.
- It's pig's blood mixed with food dye.
- (Gary) Eh?
.
Got the rest of the guts in the corner, by the sofa.
And some flat rib.
Some boneless loin.
A few pounds of braising mince.
And 1 5 packets of sliced ham.
- What's the ham for?
.
- Sandwiches.
Yeah, I'm a hyphenate.
- Special effiects...hyphen...
location catering.
- Right.
First positions, please, everyone.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Look!
- You want me to mop that up?
.
- Yeah.
- No, don't touch it!
That's well proper.
It looks authentic.
Are you the director?
.
No, me.
Thank you.
- Extras, could you clear the set, please?
.
- Good luck, darling.
I need to talk to the actors.
Right!
Boys.
This is your first look at the alien.
Opening scene.
You two?
.
You're at Roswell.
Area 51.
So, what I want is a bit of pointing.
Bit of nodding.
You're a natural.
Exactly, just like that.
Bit of pointing, bit of nodding.
Loads of energy.
Remember that you are professionals.
You're excited professionals.
- OK.
Feel it.
First positions.
We'll do a take.
- (Gary) Ridiculous.
Put your hat on.
We'll start from here, then I'll call you in.
- OK.
And...
- It's not on properly.
- Get offi!
-...action!
Is mine all right?
.
(Melik) Edgar, take your position.
That's good.
No, don't wave.
Muppet.
- Try that pointing thing you do.
- Like this?
.
Yeah, just like that.
It's wicked.
- Cooee!
- (Ray and Gary) Hi, Nan.
- Play with the belly.
- (Gary) This is ridiculous.
(Ray) Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
.
Stop crying.
Get on with it, will you?
.
Look, out the way!
- (Melik) Prod it.
- Not like that.
- I'm out...
- Let me do it, like this.
- You're the director now, are you?
.
- Shut up, we're shooting a movie here!
- Shut up.
- No, you shut up.
Cut!
You just ruined my shot.
(Gary) Nice leg of lamb, this.
- (Ray) Good traction on it, Preston.
- That'll be the mint sauce.
- (Ray) Nice one.
- This is good.
- Oh!
- (Jasmine) I don't believe it.
(Chuckles and sighs)
- It's all right.
- (Gary) You all right?
.
(Jasmine) Eugh.
(Melik) That's it.
Ooh, yes, it's looking good.
- (Ray) That looks good.
- That's good.
- Would you like a biscuit?
.
- Nan!
(Melik) Don't worry, we'll deal with that in the cut.
Yeah, I will, as it happens.
Is that a Jammie Dodger?
.
- (Ray) Get your fingers in there.
- That's all right.
Should we go for the heart next, Ray?
.
Keep it going.
What does he think he's doing?
.
- Is he taking the piss?
.
- Stop messing about!
And...action.
(Melik) Ray, come round the other side.
Sausage on a stick?
.
- Nan, please!
- Cut!
Cut!
For crying out loud!
- Is someone wrangling Ray's nan?
.
- Maurice...
- I can't hear you!
- He's got her in the kitchen.
- Keep her there.
Has Jasmine spritzed?
.
- No, just getting a refill.
OK, now, let's get down and dirty with the intestines.
Go on, Gary, get in there.
(Gary) What on earth is that?
.
It stinks.
Careful.
I'm gonna use that in the shop tomorrow for some sausages and burgers.
(Jasmine) Eurgh.
(Ray) Careful.
(Melik) Right.
That's good.
(Ray) Easy.
Careful with these.
(Melik) God!
- I think it's too real.
- It's a nice touch.
It's looking at me.
(Melik) OK, this is good.
Right, let's...
let's get ready to...
-...peel back the skin.
- (Gary) Got it, Ray?
.
(Ray) Yeah.
(Gary) It looks like raspberry jelly.
(Ray) Yeah, it is raspberry jelly.
(Melik) Give it to Gary.
Make out like there's a real tough, tough bone there.
It's a tough skull.
(Gary) Like that?
.
(Ray) Go on.
There.
(Melik) That's good.
That's very good.
(Ray) Lovely.
Now, gently...place the brain on the tray.
- Right.
- Gently.
- (Gary) Ready?
.
- Yeah.
Oh, no!
Mind the brain!
(Gary) Ah... (Gary) Ah, the carpet!
- Cut!
Cut, cut, cut!
- (Gary) Ah...she's gonna kill us.
Don't worry, Gaz.
Put a bit of salt on that.
- Are you sure?
.
Isn't it salt and wine?
.
- No, it's for red wine you put...
- (Melik) It's salt and white wine.
- Put a pot plant on it.
I don't know what else is in the skull so, Preston, please tell me it's gonna work.
Brain's sorted.
No more slippage.
(Melik) OK.
OK, good.
Action!
OK, easy does it, easy.
OK, ready, Ray?
.
Ready?
.
Wait!
Cut!
- What the hell is that?
.
- That would be the stuffied sheep's stomach.
Dash of garlic, 90 minutes at gas mark 4, a highly nutritious meal for a family of five.
That's great.
Our alien travels millions of light years across the universe with nothing but a haggis to guide him?
.
- It's not slipping, though, is it?
.
- (Key in lock)
(Gary) Uh!
(He sighs)
Doreen!
How was Ibiza?
.
- (Ray) Now, Doreen, don't fly offi the handle.
- (She gasps)
- It's not what it looks like, OK?
.
- No.
I can explain everything.
Shall we call that a day?
.
- (Ray) It won't fit.
- (Gary) It will, just shove it in.
- What are we doing here?
.
- This was your idea.
I don't just mean this.
I mean the shoot.
I mean the whole thing.
It's a complete disaster.
It's not a complete disaster.
I mean, bits of it were quite good.
Bits of it?
.
- Would you show that film to Lazlo Voros?
.
- No.
No.
I'm a dead man, aren't I?
.
Not necessarily.
You're the worst liar I have ever met.
Yeah, but that's the diffierence between you and me, Ray.
That's why you stand a chance with Voros.
Bet on yourself.
Isn't that what you said?
.
- What?
.
- The bloody head doesn't fit.
(Dogs bark)
(Heavy Caribbean accent) Is what you a-look 'pon?
.
- Um...what?
.
- Voros ready to see you now.
Follow me.
(Sobbing)
Follow me.
Mr Voros, good evening.
Lovely to see you again.
If you speak to me again without being spoken to first, I will happily sit here flossing my teeth while Zachary is breaking every single bone in your body.
- Mm.
- Is that the film?
.
- Mm-hm.

- Look, I'm sorry, Mr Voros.
- This is the most... beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life.

We are not alone.

You proved it.

Thank you, Ray.
@ Yeah
@ Home grown, on the bone
@ All the channels show the same old war zone As I walk alone in the city
@ Making me an offer Now don't they look pretty...
- Yes!
- Hugged you?
.
Proper hugged me.
I still can't believe it myself.
You know what this means?
.
If Voros bought it, maybe other people will as well.
We should run offi a few hundred copies for the cornershops who bought my Elvis videos.
If we got 10.99 a pop and shifted, say, a thousand of them, that'd be...
- Eleven grand.
- Eleven grand.
- So, I had this idea.
- I had the idea.
- Well...
- It was...
Gary's idea was to invite all of the cornershop owners to a screening of the footage but do it somewhere impressive.
- To get the credibility up a little bit?
.
- Yeah.
See, I thought the grander the place was, the more excited the buyers might be and even start bidding against each other.
Raise the price.
And fortunately there was one very grand place who happened to have a room free.
The Natural History Museum.
- No way.
- Yeah, that's exactly what they said.
- Oh, not there?
.
- (Both) No.
- So, we had to find somewhere else.
- The Museum of London.
- Don't know that place.
- No, not many do.
But it was perfect.
They didn't ask too many questions.
The key thing was to keep the screening quiet.
- What you did is invite just a few?
.
- Yeah.
And apart from that we would keep it absolutely secret.
- (Crowd shouting)
- There's hundreds of people out there.
The Chief Constable is worried about losing control.
I don't care.
This is my screening and I'm not letting them in.
I'm not going to be blamed for causing a riot in front of the national press.
The national press are here?
.
The Sun, the Mirror, two television crews.
(Crowd) Let us in!
Let us in!
Not bad for a little press release to the local paper, eh?
.
You idiot!
There's no way this many people are gonna believe that film.
The national press'll see right through it.
It's a chance worth taking.
You can't buy publicity like this.
- (Klaxon)
- I say we do it.
No.
Absolutely, categorically...
Yes, 5 a seat, madam.
Thank you, come on in.
(Tutting)
- You hear that?
.
- I can't hear anything.
Exactly.
They're not laughing.

- Director know about this?

- He's waiting for you now, sir.

"ls it real?" "Man from Mars". "UFO".
Our alien, full of sausages, was on the front page of every newspaper around the world.
Raymond, there's a man on the phone from Argentina.
- Take a number, Nan.
I'll call him back.
- Right.
- (Melik) I've got a woman from Italian TV.
- He cannot speak to you now...
- I'm going to have to get back to them.
-...but give me your number...
- I appreciate your interest.
-...and he will call you back.
- Can I call you back?
.
- That's us.
- No, I promise.
All right.
OK, bye-bye.
- Yes.
- That's us on the telly.
- It's been like this all day.
Every TV station in the world wants our film, Gary.
- There's hundreds of them.
- Buenos dias.
Bye, pet.
I have absolutely no idea how we've done this.
But since we have, and it's the only opportunity we'll ever have to make any money at all,
- we have to do it right.
- That's what we are doing.
Make them compete against each other then sell the film to the highest bidder.
No, not the one highest bidder.
You sell it to the highest bidder in every territory round the world.
You're saying...
-...sell it over and over...
- And over again, yes!
We really are gonna be rich!

So, we hired a room at a hotel near Heathrow...
- It was a business suite.
- Yeah, with a little reception area.

I'm taking on the world with you.
UFO nutcases, Hungarian psychos, bring them on, but there is one thing I will never ever mess with and that's the lnland Revenue.
- The cash isn't about me fiddling my taxes.
- What is it about, then?
.
You said it yourself.
This might be the only time in our lives we get to make money like this and I just want to see it.
I want to feel it, Gary, you know, I want to...
I want to touch it and smell it.
I know it sounds stupid but there it is.
Seven hundred and...
And forty-six thousand, nine hundred and ninety...
Seven hundred and forty-seven thousand dollars.
@ Oh, yeah
@ In sweet harmony
@ Let's come together right now
@ Oh, yeah
@ In sweet harmony
@ Let's come together right now... (Morgan) Beautiful!
.
(Gary) We'd fooled the world.
- We were sitting on a good sum of money.
- Nice.
- (Ray) In cash.
- Even nicer.
I mean, it was...it was all perfect.
And then things took a bit of a turn for the worse.
(Gary) Yeah, well, you see, I could have sworn I was being followed.
(Morgan) Are you alleging covert surveillance of Shoefield and Santilli by the US Military?
.
Your words, not mine.
(Morgan) Was there a ClA file on them, then?
.
Almost certainly.
And, generally speaking, when there's a file there's surveillance.
Generally speaking.
- So, the US military thought the film was real?
.
- There's more to it than that.
Don't know who he is, but I keep seeing him.
It's starting to freak me out.
Do you know what it probably is?
.
Probably one of your weird ex-girlfriends.
- I don't have any weirdo ex-girlfriends.
- Oh, come on.
What about that one from Basildon?
.
Big girl, facial hair, ankles like lampposts.
- Janet.
- Janet!
That's the one.
- (Train rumbles)
- She hung around for weeks, didn't she?
.
- It's not Janet.
- Look, whoever it is, put it out of your mind, at least for now.
Think about it.
In two days' time, our film goes out in ninety-eight countries around the world.
- We're going to be famous!
- You still don't get it.
Everyone on the planet is going to know we're liars.
Yeah... rich liars, though.
(Phone)
- (Train rumbles and clatters)
- Hello?
.
There was no deal allowing you to exploit the film and simply pay me a cut of the profits.
But there was.
We talked about it.
- That was the understanding.
- Not my understanding.
Unless you have, er...some signed papework that says othewise.
(Whispers) Ray.
(Dog barks)
Now that we've cleared that up, let me spell things out for you.
I now control all the deals and we split any cash 80 to 20 to me.
I want to review any agreement you've already made and I alone will decide whether to approve them or not.
(Dog barking)
But...it's going out tomorrow night.
That would be a very grave mistake on your part.
(Dog barking)
(Growls and barks like a dog)
So, what did you do?
.
The only thing we could do.
We tried to pull the broadcast.
Which is when it happened.
What?
.
(Ray) Voros was in the middle of a crop circle looking up to the heavens hoping for some sort of close encounter, probably.
It just came out of nowhere.
Alien spacecraft?
.
No.
A green Land Rover.
- Knocked him over, killed him.
- Dead.
He was naked.
Are you saying that the US military intelligence had Lazlo Voros killed?
.
Think about it.
If there really was a genuine alien autopsy film, then when Ray Santilli popped up
US military would have been shitting their pants.
All of a sudden there's an extra print of a film that they had kept hidden for 50 years, a print they didn't even know existed.
The biggest secret in the history of the world's about to be blown wide open.
Then they see Santilli's film.
Once they realise the film's a fraud, that Ray's a fraud, then he and the film become the best possible smokescreen they could ever ask for.
All the time that people are looking at Ray Santilli and his stupid film they're not looking at them, and the real film.
They know that Ray's gonna be found out as a faker, which will just bury the truth even deeper, for even longer.
Or, of course, it could just have been an accident.
(Screams)
Do you ever wonder if there's someone up there, looking out for us?
.
Someone.
Or something.
(Ray) Widescreen.
Got it in specially... (Jasmine) I can't believe it.
This is so exciting.
Could you budge up, Skeletor?
.
- Here's Maurice.
- All right, lover boy?
.
(Nan) Raymond, did you set the video to record The X-Files?
.
- All sorted.
They put it on at the same time!
- I think it's a compliment, though.
I still can't believe that our little film is about to be shown in every continent on the planet.
- I know!
- Can you believe it?
.
-...based on all available information.
- It's starting!
If what you are about to see is real, it's the most startling film footage in history.
Although we remain sceptical, some believe this is authentic footage of an alien life form.
Real or not, I must warn you, this appears to be an actual autopsy and some of the footage you will see is very gruesome.

(Frakes) Alien Autopsy: fact or fiction?
.
Here outside Roswell is where the alleged crash happened some 50 years ago.
Was it a flying saucer?
.
Were there alien bodies on board?
.
People still come and look for some kind of clue.
But the evidence of the alien crash didn't come from here.
It was revealed halfway around the world.
What Santilli saw and purchased were reels of black-and-white film showing an autopsy being performed on a strange humanoid being.
The cameraman, who claims to have had a top military clearance told Santilli that in 1 947 he was flown urgently to Roswell where he filmed the recovery of several of these beings, both alive and dead, as well as the autopsy of one of them.
This could be the world's first look at an actual being from another planet.
The strange body appears intact except for an ugly wound on the right thigh.
Two mysterious doctors wearing contamination suits study its bizarre features.
What the fuck is that?
.
They are either pathologists or they are surgeons who have done a fair number of autopsies.
This supposedly was filmed in 1 947 and, while things haven't changed, we see some things that would have been expected at that time such as the use of a handsaw in removing the skullcap.
(Frakes) A third person wearing a mask watches from behind the glass partition.
Is this indeed a top-secret military autopsy performed on an alien in 1 947?
.
(Man) This is a structure that must be the brain if it is a human being.
It looks like no brain that I have ever seen, whether it's a brain filled with tumour, a brain that has been radiated a brain that has been traumatised and is haemorrhagic...
What is this?
.
I would prefer to say for the time being that it is humanoid.
But I cannot say that it is a member of the human race as you and I know the human race.
What if?
.
What if?
.
What if the alien is real?
.
Let's consider.
He was an explorer, perhaps a scientist.
Crashed and died on a distant blue planet, light years from his home.
A frightened race of beings found his lifeless body, performed experiments and hid the results.
Why did he come to our planet?
.
What went wrong?
.
Obviously his own mission failed but in his death he may have delivered the most important message mankind has ever received.
We are not alone.
They believe it!
Gary, where have you been?
.
- What's happened?
.
- They believe it!
They only believe it!
- Right, you ready for this?

- (Knock at door)
- That's fantastic.
- No, it isn't fantastic, because we don't have any film to show them.
The only film we ever did have was shot on modern film stock
- and that is still in Lazlo Voros's safe.
- (Doorbell repeatedly rung)
Maybe we could make another one.
You don't get this, do you?
.
This film means so much to so many people, Ray.
- Scary people, clinically disturbed people.
- (Knock at door)
Can you imagine what will happen if they ever find out it's a fake?
.
You know, strictly speaking, it's not actually a fake.
It's more of a remake.
You've got to remember that.
And you've got to relax a bit more, Gary.
Nobody's going to find out anything.
- What are you doing, anyway?

- Packing.
- For what?

They want me to go over, all expenses paid.
- But you can't start going on chat shows.
- Why not?

Has nothing I've said made any sense to you?
.
They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.
- I can answer anything.
- Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.
- They can't keep changing.
- They won't.
- And how do you know they won't?

- Because I'm taking you with me.

OK?

If we can all do that, then there's just a chance this story'll blow itself out and we can all quietly get on with the rest of our lives.
Quietly's good.

- Because it's like we've robbed a bank.
- And the one thing any robber knows...
- Never spend the money too soon.

What do I have to do?

Just...
learn these lines and say them in front of a camera.
During the Second World War, I was a combat photo... (Coughs)...tographer for the United States Air Force, a few months after getting...
- Whoa!
- Too much, I know.
...flown to an airbase I'd never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be Ros...well.
I was a combat photographer for the...
United States Airforce.
A few months after my return home from Europe
I was rudely awakened in the early hours of the morning and I was flown through the night to an airbase that I had never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be in Roswell, New Mexico.
Shit.
And there in Roswell, I was ordered to film an autopsy being performed... (Sighs) ...on a wretched alien creature apparently extracted from a crashed UFO.
Who the fuck is that?
.
I'll never forget it.
The stench was unbearable, although I suppose we didn't smell that wonderful to them.
Others of his like were in the back...
- This guy's good.
- This guy's better than Harvey.
Turns out, he used to be an actor.
- An actor?
.
Perfect.
- Yeah!
He'd made two movies with Lionel Barrymore in 1 935, then after that started drinking.
When we met him, he hadn't had an acting gig in about 40 years.
- You're lucky.
You're very, very lucky.
- Very, very, very.
And there we were sitting upstairs in my nan's house with seven hundred and forty-seven thousand US dollars in a pile like that.
- Bigger, even.
- It was probably like that.
On my bed.
And, one seventh of it is yours.
Ninety-seven thousand dollars.
There you are, Gary.
Merry Christmas.
Ha-ha!
Thanks.
A seventh of 747.000 is about 1 06,700, Ray.
Is it?
.
I know!
Look, I had it all ready for you!
- Get out!
- I did!
You expect me to believe that?
.
You know what?
.
I have just one more question.
What was it that you actually saw on the film in Miami?
.
I mean, there's no way that it was an alien.
So, what was it that gave you the idea?
.
- I told you.
No one ever believes me.
- Leave it to me.
There's one tiny bit of the story we haven't told you about yet.
- (Doorbell)
- Ah!
- It's the guy from the film lab.
- Yeah.
And according to him, he'd managed to recover some of the image.
Right.
(Voice echoes) I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corp.
One night in 1947,
I was pulled out of bed and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where I was ordered to... film this.
Film this.
Film this.
One night in 1947...
One night in 1947 to an airbase I'd never heard of...

But as it rolled out around the world, one of the things that...didn't come back to haunt us but was quite entertaining was that the cameraman who'd sold it to Ray, he had a view that Ray was a foreigner and that selling it to him was the last he'd ever hear of it.

You're too uptight.
Careful!
(Knock on door)
Hi.
You all right?
Uh...my name's Ray Santilli.
-This is my friend, Gary Shoefield.
-All right?
You've...probably never heard of us, though, have you?
Correct.
Why don't you type Ray's name into Google, and see what happens?
-(Morgan) S-A-N-T-l...
-L-L-l.
How many hits?
Three million, nine hundred eighty two thousand... (All) Four hundred and seven.
Yeah.
( Supergrass.:
Alright)
Bet you want to hear their story now.
We are young
We run green Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights Feel alright
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag Put it out
See our friends, see the sights Feel alright
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around lf we like
But we're alright... (Phone)
-Gary, how you doing?
-How do you think I'm doing?
-You took my car.
-Calm down, Gary.
We discussed this.
Yes, Ray.
We discussed it, and I said no.
Gary, please. lt's only for one day.
Look, whatever you do, don't eat in the car.
OK, mate.
Hey, thanks, Gary.
I appreciate this.
-Ray!
- We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright...
-(Man) lf you suspect this is a pirated video...
-You up yet, Nan?
I'm putting the new Woody Harrelson on.
It's called Natural Born Killers.
I think you'll like it.
Just, er...don't stop it once it's started, will you?
-l'm taping it for a couple of friends.
-All right, sweetheart.
-l thought you wanted to watch the film.
-Maybe later, when I get back.
-Back from where?
-My date.
-Your date?
-His name's Maurice. I met him at bingo.
-Where's he taking you?
-Margate for the day.
Oh, I cannot wait.
I haven't been on a date in 47 years.
Now, just hold on. I don't know anything about this Maurice character and if you've just met him, you don't either.
I don't like this one little bit, Nan.
(Doorbell)
Ah...
-Oh, hello. I'm...
-Maurice.
Right.
-This is a first date, yes?
No funny business.
-l'm not sure I under... I want her back by four o'clock, or there'll be trouble.
(Nan) Raymond, go, please.
(Ray) Do we understand each other?
Four o'clock. I'll be waiting.
Nice one, Edgar.
-You get them Babe tapes?
-Yeah, plus a free GoldenEye.
(Ray) Come on, I've got cushions.
I've got pillows.
T-shirts of the The King.
What about you, my darling?
All the way from Vegas.
Oh...
So, are you saying this is a genuine Toy Story video?
Yes. I've got friends in the business.
They look after me.
-You got friends in Hollywood?
-Yeah.
Me and Mr Potato Head are like this.
-That's me on top there, look.
-Eh?
Got something for you.
Here you go, my friend.
Timecop, special edition.
Van Damme has never been better.
I don't want one of your stolen videos, thank you very much.
They're copied, with great care and attention by me.
-You'll have no problem.
-That's where you're right, Mr Santilli.
Islington Council Trading Standards Officer.
And it's you that's got the problem.
Oi!
Arrest him.
(He mouths)
-l told you on the phone, I can't help you.
-You're my lawyer!
I'm not your lawyer. I'm not anyone's lawyer... (Raises voice) ...because I'm not a lawyer.
I'm a clerk, in a legal department.
But they've impounded all me stock.
I have to get it back.
This month's sales are paying for my trip to America.
A buying trip that's gonna transform my whole business.
I'm sorry.
Please go now.
All right.
Help me out of this, and I'll cut you in as well.
You're sitting on my receipts.
I want you to leave.
You can't want to be a legal clerk for the rest of your life.
(Man) Gary, a word in your ear, please.
I'm not going to be.
(Man) Come on, chop-chop.
Come in, have a seat.
I wanted to have a word with you, Gary, because there's going to be an opportunity for a bright young individual that the firm is willing to send back to college to get their law degree and then put on a fast track to top management.
I had heard some rumours.
Because of your experience, your knowledge of this company, and the people working in this company, we wanted to ask you.
Really?
Who you'd choose.
Marcus or Rachel?
It's not easy, is it?
Who would you be more comfortable calling boss?
(Woman) Yes, sir, two portions?
OK.
(Man) You all right, mate?
Best thing that ever happened to you, Gary.
Now you know you've got no future there, tell 'em to shove it.
Look, how are you ever going to date a Page Three girl or drive a Pontiac GTO, working as a lawyer for a biscuit firm?
I don't care what you say, I'm not going to America with you.
Aren't you tired of playing it safe yet?
I mean, take a risk, bet on yourself.
Bet on myself?
Yeah!
-Maybe you're right.
-Course I'm right.
-Why do I need them?
-Exactly.
I could pay for myself to go to law school.
What?
Apply for a place myself, pay the fees myself.
-After we get back from America?
-l'm not going to America.
-But you haven't got any money.
-But I will have, though.
When I sell my car.
Do you have any idea what a mint condition, perfectly restored 1 97 4 Ford Capri goes for these days?
Ray, where's my car?
(Ray) I can sell Elvis stuff standing on my head.
Authentic memorabilia, that's the business we're going into.
You can't still be huffy about the car.
-Why not?
-But look what you've got in its place.
A stake in your own business.
And this time, we're going right to the top.
-Mm.
-Don't want your Sag Aloo?
-No.
-Wicked.
Cheers.
(Ray) The plan was perfect.
Elvis had given a concert in Cleveland in 1 954.
So, we stuck an ad in the local paper saying we were gonna be in town for a few days and we'd pay cash to anybody who had any old photos or, better still, film footage of the King himself performing there 40 years before.
Then the idea was we'd bring it all home, sell it for a fortune.
(Gary) Well, that was the idea.
Gary!
Gary, you've got to come and see this.
-This is Harvey.
-Hello.
(Whispers) Look!
Look at that.
It's the King, performing here 41 years ago.
And it's uncopyrighted.
So, you think you might be interested?
Uh, maybe...maybe.
Condition's not great.
-There's no sound, which is a problem.
-No sound. lt's a problem.
I'll tell you what, why don't we forget the whole thing?
Why don't you go and get some more punch, while I discuss this with my business partner?
Fine, fine.
(Both chuckle)
-Will it be expensive?
-No, I've got him in the palm of my hand.
(Gary) I feel so lonely, baby I feel so lonely
Since my baby left, ooh-ooh I found a new place to dwell, ooh-ooh
Down at the end of lonely street ls Heartbreak Hotel, oh, baby...
Jesus!
You scared the life out of me.
Hang on a minute. lf you've come back about the film, I'm sorry, you're too late.
-A deal's a deal.
-l'm fine with the deal.
You see... I have another piece of film I think you'll be interested in.
-Well, what is it?
-l don't have it with me.
But you've really got to see it, to understand.
-Did you just see that?
-What?
There's a shooting star, just there, right above us.
Yeah, but it's gone now.
Yeah... there are things up there so beautiful sometimes I've cried... just thinking about them.
Beautiful and terrible both.
Well, it's going to be a wild ride for you, Raymond.
Wild, wild ride.
After you.
(Door bangs shut)
This is it.
I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corps.
One night in 1 947... I was pulled out of bed and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where l was ordered to...film this.
(Morgan) All right, just a minute...
Can you say that again?
The film showed the autopsy of an alien being.
It was carried out at Roswell Air Base,
New Mexico in July 1 947.
And you saw the footage?
What did you think?
I didn't see it, you see. I'd had the early night, so I didn't go with him to Florida.
-Didn't you have jet lag?
-No, I drank too much punch, to be honest.
(Both) We had pretty strong punch.
Oh, do me a favour.
Do you have any idea what it would mean if this was actually true?
If you'd actually found documentary proof that man wasn't alone in the universe?
It would be the most important discovery in the history of mankind.
It would change everything forever.
You're telling me out of all the people on the planet you're the one who's been blessed with this discovery?
Isn't it brilliant?
(Sighs) I can't deal with this. I can't deal with another one of your fantastic lies.
But it's not a lie.
Just sell your imaginary film, give me my money back, and we won't talk about it again.
I can't.
Harvey wants $30,000 for the film.
-Where am I gonna get $30,000 from?
-l don't care.
I need an investor to put up the money.
You have to help me.
If you ask me, it wasn't an investor he needed, it was a nutcase who already believed this UFO nonsense.
Fortunately, just the right nutcase happened to share Gary's passion for cars.
(Gary) Lazlo Voros.
(Morgan) This guy was some kind of investor or something?
(Gary) No, he was a psycho Hungarian art dealer who had a booming coke business on the side.
He lived with his Jamaican boyfriend-cum-bodyguard in Belgravia.
I'd met him at a car show in Birmingham, 'cause we're both obsessed with Detroit muscle cars of the 1 97 0s.
And, frankly, he scared the shit out of me.
But Ray was desperate and Voros was a big fan of crop circles.
(Manic laughter)
(Ray) So, Gary made the call.
-Um...hi.
Are you, er...?
-Get in.
OK.
This had better be good, Mr Santilli.
(Muffled cries) ls there someone in the boot?
Just concentrate on telling me about this film.
Well, it's the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen.
Unbelievable.
There it is, in front of me, up on the screen.
Proof that there is life on other planets.
And all I need is thirty grand.
(Voros) Hm.
Why don't we get some air?
(Muffled cries and banging)
(Seagulls cry)
(Voros laughs)
Ah!
You know what I like about the heavens, Mr Santilli?
No.
-All that beauty.
You know what it is?
-No.
Just the remnants of a massive explosion.
Violence is everywhere, and I'm something of a connoisseur when it comes to violence.
(Click)
-(Seagulls cry)
-Are you lying to me about what's on this film?
-(Seagulls' cries intensify)
-No.
No, no.
I swear to you, everything I've told you is absolutely true.
-(Gunshot) -(Bird squawks)
(Splash)
I like you, Ray.
I really do.
You'll have the money tomorrow, in the morning.
(Ray) I...
I'm in pieces by this point.
I am the most scared I have ever been in my life.
-You got the money.
-Don't underestimate how scary it was.
-Oh, no, I'm not.
-lt was a really scary moment.
-But you got the money.
-But don't underestimate how scary... (Morgan) Hang on.
Hang on a minute.
-You got the money and...
-(Ray) We got the money.
-lt's all there?
-lt's all there.
It better be.
I don't want anybody knowing it was me who gave you this.
I'm not signing anything, I'm not banking this money, and there's nobody still alive that knows that I've got this film.
And...
I want it kept that way.
(Ray) That was it, I'd got it.
I'd just pulled off the deal of the century.
(Morgan) lf this is the most secret film in history why did the cameraman end up with it?
I don't get that part.
By mistake.
There are eight prints made of the film.
Four of them and the original negative were sent to Washington.
Three more were sent to Air Force Intelligence in Utah.
The final print goes with Harvey to Florida, where he's told it's going to be picked up.
A week later, the whole world of military intelligence is completely turned on its head.
-The Air Force splits from the Army.
-That's when that happened.
The OSS is broken up and restructured into the ClA.
(Ray) None of the cameraman's contact numbers work anymore.
A year later, the film in Florida still hadn't been picked up.
So, he hung onto it, thinking that some day somebody would just come and get it.
(Gary) But no one ever did.
-Right, OK.
Take a seat, Jasmine.
-(Jasmine) Ooh, sorry, excuse me.
I'm sure you've all heard something about the film that I've just brought back from Florida.
And I'm sure a lot of you think it's just old Ray, up to his old tricks, as usual.
(Laughter)
-Preston, get the curtains.
Run the film.
-Righto, mate.
-(Maurice) Get my specs...
-(Man) lt's a good build-up, mate.
-(Gary) Ready?
-(Preston) Here we go.
- Pah-pah pah-pah pah-pah...
-(Man) Eight, seven, six...
-(Jasmine) Five, four, three...
Just coming. lt's gonna take a minute.
Just coming.
is that it?
Hang on, what's happened to it?
This is fine.
The projector's working fine.
It's the film, I think.
No, that's not right.
-l told you this would be a laugh.
-No, that's not what I saw.
I saw American military bringing a body off the back of a truck.
-This body was an alien. lt was an alien.
-(They laugh)
The alien is just lying there, and then they cut it open and pull out all its guts.
You can see President Truman looking in the viewing glass.
-Excuse me, where's the Rank Film Lab?
-Down there, on your left.
On the left, thank you.
You don't believe me.
-Doesn't matter what I believe.
-lt matters to me.
I really appreciate this, Auntie P.
Jeffrey!
My nephew's got a problem with some film.
Ohh.
Walk this way.
Ah.
Ah-ah-ah.
Ah, look at that.
-1 940s Kodak safety stock.
-(Auntie P) ls it?
You know what the worst thing you can do to a film like this is?
Keep it in sealed containers in a high temperature, high-humidity environment for any length of time.
Well, it's been kept in that can, in a garage in Miami.
For 50 years.
There's your problem.
-(Groans) Smell that?
-(Auntie P) That's bad.
Sort of...vinegary.
That's the film eating itself.
Oh, yeah.
From the moment that can was opened the process will have started.
We'll do what we can but don't hold your breath.
Chances of rescuing anything from this film are virtually non-existent.
-lt was gone?
-(Gary) Yeah.
Meanwhile, I've got Lazlo Voros on the phone.
"Where's my film?
Where is my film?"
-All the time ringing.
-The guy who's had a revolver at my head.
-He's gonna kill me.
What do I tell him?
-The truth.
You've got no other choice.
Oh, really?
And how does that go?
"Hey, Lazlo, I've spent $30,000 of your money on a film that was fine when I saw it
"but now it's eaten itself."
(Thunderclap)
(Excited laughter)
(Man talks quietly and woman laughs)
(Excited laughter)
-(Laughter)
-Yes.
Oh, erm...hello, Raymond.
Don't you "Oh, hello, Raymond" me.
What's going on here?
-(Both) Nothing.
-l was just...
I was just leaving.
(Raucous laughter)
What happens with my nan in my house is my business.
-Whether you like it or not.
-Oh!
I tho...
I thought it was your nan's house.
That's beside the point.
How old are you, anyway?
A hundred and two.
Have you got a job?
Or a pension?
-l run my own business.
-Really?
Doing what exactly?
I make those.
My family's been making them for generations.
Harvey Nicks, Harrods, Selfridges...
There's not a shape or size or shop in London we haven't supplied at some point in the last 1 50 years.
It's the most perfect idea.
Last night the answer suddenly came to me.
Maurice can make us an alien.
Then I can film it.
-Film it?
-l know what I saw.
All we do is copy it.
You can't even take a photograph of your nan without cropping her head off.
-How are you gonna shoot an alien autopsy?
-Not me.
Melik.
-Melik runs a kebab shop!
-At weekends he shoots wedding videos.
( Stereo MCs.:
Step lt Up)
Preston can bring in some meat offcuts to be the internal organs.
Edgar does up corpses for open-casket funerals.
He can do make-up.
Jasmine's dad's in antiques.
She can source the props.
Hold on.
Where are you going to shoot this Oscar-winning production?
-Your sister's not back from Ibiza till Sunday.
-No.
-Her flat would be perfect.
-No!
This is never going to work.
Count me out.
Thanks, Gary.
And, hey, I appreciate it.
-Jasmine, we're making a movie.
-l'm not taking my top off again.
Or seeing what I see
Curves with destinations
Poetic symmetry
You cause an inflammation ln my anatomy, don't you see
Yeah, yeah, yeah You can send a forget-me-not
Yeah, yeah, yeah But I'll still reach up to the top
Yeah, yeah, yeah Until the last day that I drop
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To the left
To the right
Keep it going, keep it going, it's alright
To the left
And to the right
Step it up, step it up, it's alright
We want flesh
We want flesh
We want flesh
(Preston) All right?
- All you gotta do is bounce it...
-(Preston) Eurgh!
To see just what goes where
There ain't no way around it...
Can't you just tell me?
-l want to know if it's any good or not.
-(Melik) Any good?
You're working with the best.
-Show me.
-Here we go.
And...open them.
-l'm a genius.
-(All) Eh?
-(Gary) You what?
-l mean...you're a genius.
And you.
-All of you, just all genius...
-(Laughter)
Great.
That's just half of it.
Wait till you see the rest.
We've still got a couple of adjustments to make, but you'll get the basic idea.
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.
-Ta-da!
-(They gasp)
(Jasmine) Oh.
We remoulded an old maternity mannequin we used to make for Mothercare.
Added an extra finger to each hand, and extra toes.
And...see the skull?
Maurice has done it in a special latex, so we can peel the skin back on camera.
We got some mince and some pig's blood balled up in some lady's tights inside.
It'll look just like the exposed brain.
-(Maurice) Are the crash wounds right?
-They're perfect.
The whole thing is just...
exactly like what I saw on the film.
Exactly.
So, we're on, then?
For tonight?
-Yeah.
-Good.
Oh, cheer up, Gary.
Cheer up?
What do you expect?
I've got an alien lying with its arse in my sister's kitchen sink.
-(Ray) Ready?
-l just want to try something with the lights.
-(Jasmine) Would you turn the light...
-One second.
Oh, is that...actual blood?
-lt's pig's blood mixed with food dye.
-(Gary) Eh?
Got the rest of the guts in the corner, by the sofa.
And some flat rib.
Some boneless loin.
A few pounds of braising mince.
And 1 5 packets of sliced ham.
-What's the ham for?
-Sandwiches.
Yeah, I'm a hyphenate.
-Special effects...hyphen...
location catering.
-Right.
First positions, please, everyone.
-Hey, hey, hey!
Look!
-You want me to mop that up?
-Yeah.
-No, don't touch it!
That's well proper. lt looks authentic.
Are you the director?
No, me.
Thank you.
-Extras, could you clear the set, please?
-Good luck, darling.
I need to talk to the actors.
Right!
Boys.
This is your first look at the alien.
Opening scene.
You two?
You're at Roswell.
Area 51 .
So, what I want is a bit of pointing.
Bit of nodding.
You're a natural.
Exactly, just like that.
Bit of pointing, bit of nodding.
Loads of energy.
Remember that you are professionals.
You're excited professionals.
-OK.
Feel it.
First positions.
We'll do a take.
-(Gary) Ridiculous.
Put your hat on.
We'll start from here, then I'll call you in.
-OK.
And...
-lt's not on properly.
-Get off!
-...action!
is mine all right?
(Melik) Edgar, take your position.
That's good.
No, don't wave.
Muppet.
-Try that pointing thing you do.
-Like this?
Yeah, just like that. lt's wicked.
-Cooee!
-(Ray and Gary) Hi, Nan.
-Play with the belly.
-(Gary) This is ridiculous.
(Ray) Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
Stop crying.
Get on with it, will you?
Look, out the way!
-(Melik) Prod it.
-Not like that.
-l'm out...
-Let me do it, like this.
-You're the director now, are you?
-Shut up, we're shooting a movie here!
-Shut up.
-No, you shut up.
Cut!
You just ruined my shot.
(Gary) Nice leg of lamb, this.
-(Ray) Good traction on it, Preston.
-That'll be the mint sauce.
-(Ray) Nice one.
-This is good.
-Oh!
-(Jasmine) I don't believe it.
(Chuckles and sighs)
-lt's all right.
-(Gary) You all right?
(Jasmine) Eugh.
(Melik) That's it.
Ooh, yes, it's looking good.
-(Ray) That looks good.
-That's good.
-Would you like a biscuit?
-Nan!
(Melik) Don't worry, we'll deal with that in the cut.
Yeah, I will, as it happens.
is that a Jammie Dodger?
-(Ray) Get your fingers in there.
-That's all right.
Should we go for the heart next, Ray?
Keep it going.
What does he think he's doing?
-ls he taking the piss?
-Stop messing about!
And...action.
(Melik) Ray, come round the other side.
Sausage on a stick?
-Nan, please!
-Cut!
Cut!
For crying out loud!
-ls someone wrangling Ray's nan?
-Maurice...
-l can't hear you!
-He's got her in the kitchen.
-Keep her there.
Has Jasmine spritzed?
-No, just getting a refill.
OK, now, let's get down and dirty with the intestines.
Go on, Gary, get in there.
(Gary) What on earth is that?
It stinks.
Careful. I'm gonna use that in the shop tomorrow for some sausages and burgers.
(Jasmine) Eurgh.
(Ray) Careful.
(Melik) Right.
That's good.
(Ray) Easy.
Careful with these.
(Melik) God!
-l think it's too real.
-lt's a nice touch.
It's looking at me.
(Melik) OK, this is good.
Right, let's...
let's get ready to...
-...peel back the skin.
-(Gary) Got it, Ray?
(Ray) Yeah.
(Gary) lt looks like raspberry jelly.
(Ray) Yeah, it is raspberry jelly.
(Melik) Give it to Gary.
Make out like there's a real tough, tough bone there. lt's a tough skull.
(Gary) Like that?
(Ray) Go on.
There.
(Melik) That's good.
That's very good.
(Ray) Lovely.
Now, gently...place the brain on the tray.
-Right.
-Gently.
-(Gary) Ready?
-Yeah.
Oh, no!
Mind the brain!
(Gary) Ah... (Gary) Ah, the carpet!
-Cut!
Cut, cut, cut!
-(Gary) Ah...she's gonna kill us.
Don't worry, Gaz.
Put a bit of salt on that.
-Are you sure?
Isn't it salt and wine?
-No, it's for red wine you put...
-(Melik) lt's salt and white wine.
-Put a pot plant on it.
I don't know what else is in the skull so, Preston, please tell me it's gonna work.
Brain's sorted.
No more slippage.
(Melik) OK.
OK, good.
Action!
OK, easy does it, easy.
OK, ready, Ray?
Ready?
Wait!
Cut!
-What the hell is that?
-That would be the stuffed sheep's stomach.
Dash of garlic, 90 minutes at gas mark 4, a highly nutritious meal for a family of five.
That's great.
Our alien travels millions of light years across the universe with nothing but a haggis to guide him?
-lt's not slipping, though, is it?
-(Key in lock)
(Gary) Uh!
(He sighs)
Doreen!
How was Ibiza?
-(Ray) Now, Doreen, don't fly off the handle.
-(She gasps)
-lt's not what it looks like, OK?
-No.
I can explain everything.
Shall we call that a day?
-(Ray) lt won't fit.
-(Gary) lt will, just shove it in.
-What are we doing here?
-This was your idea.
I don't just mean this. I mean the shoot. I mean the whole thing. lt's a complete disaster.
It's not a complete disaster.
I mean, bits of it were quite good.
Bits of it?
-Would you show that film to Lazlo Voros?
-No.
No. I'm a dead man, aren't I?
Not necessarily.
You're the worst liar I have ever met.
Yeah, but that's the difference between you and me, Ray.
That's why you stand a chance with Voros.
Bet on yourself. lsn't that what you said?
-What?
-The bloody head doesn't fit.
(Dogs bark)
(Heavy Caribbean accent) ls what you a-look 'pon?
-Um...what?
-Voros ready to see you now.
Follow me.
(Sobbing)
Follow me.
Mr Voros, good evening.
Lovely to see you again.
If you speak to me again without being spoken to first, I will happily sit here flossing my teeth while Zachary is breaking every single bone in your body.
-Mm.
-ls that the film?
-Mm-hm.
-(Man sobs)
-( Tricky.:
Aftermath)
-Mm!
Zachary, darling?
Run it.
For one poor boy
There's someone
For he
For she
For one poor boy
There's someone...
Um...
Did...did you, er...?
The...
I mean, what did you...think?
Oh, God.
-Look, I'm sorry, Mr Voros.
-This is the most... beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
(Sobs)
We are not alone.
Ray, you proved it, once and for all.
You proved it.
( Tom Jones.:
If I Only Knew)
Thank you, Ray.
Yeah
Home grown, on the bone
All the channels show the same old war zone As I walk alone in the city
Making me an offer Now don't they look pretty...
-Yes!
-Hugged you?
Proper hugged me.
I still can't believe it myself.
You know what this means?
If Voros bought it, maybe other people will as well.
We should run off a few hundred copies for the cornershops who bought my Elvis videos.
If we got £1 0.99 a pop and shifted, say, a thousand of them, that'd be...
-Eleven grand.
-Eleven grand.
-So, I had this idea.
-l had the idea.
-Well...
-lt was...
Gary's idea was to invite all of the cornershop owners to a screening of the footage but do it somewhere impressive.
-To get the credibility up a little bit?
-Yeah.
See, I thought the grander the place was, the more excited the buyers might be and even start bidding against each other.
Raise the price.
And fortunately there was one very grand place who happened to have a room free.
The Natural History Museum.
-No way.
-Yeah, that's exactly what they said.
-Oh, not there?
-(Both) No.
-So, we had to find somewhere else.
-The Museum of London.
-Don't know that place.
-No, not many do.
But it was perfect.
They didn't ask too many questions.
The key thing was to keep the screening quiet.
-What you did is invite just a few?
-Yeah.
And apart from that we would keep it absolutely secret.
-(Crowd shouting)
-There's hundreds of people out there.
The Chief Constable is worried about losing control.
I don't care.
This is my screening and I'm not letting them in.
I'm not going to be blamed for causing a riot in front of the national press.
The national press are here?
The Sun, the Mirror, two television crews.
(Crowd) Let us in!
Let us in!
Not bad for a little press release to the local paper, eh?
You idiot!
There's no way this many people are gonna believe that film.
The national press'll see right through it.
It's a chance worth taking.
You can't buy publicity like this.
-(Klaxon) -l say we do it.
No.
Absolutely, categorically...
Yes, £5 a seat, madam.
Thank you, come on in.
(Tutting)
-You hear that?
-l can't hear anything.
Exactly.
They're not laughing.
( Audience gasps)
(Excited chatter)
(Shouting)
This just came in from London.
-Director know about this?
-He's waiting for you now, sir.
And the next day...
"ls it real?" "Man from Mars". "UFO".
Our alien, full of sausages, was on the front page of every newspaper around the world.
Raymond, there's a man on the phone from Argentina.
-Take a number, Nan. I'll call him back.
-Right.
-(Melik) I've got a woman from Italian TV.
-He cannot speak to you now...
-l'm going to have to get back to them.
-...but give me your number...
-l appreciate your interest.
-...and he will call you back.
-Can I call you back?
-That's us.
-No, I promise.
All right.
OK, bye-bye.
-Yes.
-That's us on the telly.
-lt's been like this all day.
Every TV station in the world wants our film, Gary.
-There's hundreds of them.
-Buenos dias.
Bye, pet.
I have absolutely no idea how we've done this.
But since we have, and it's the only opportunity we'll ever have to make any money at all,
-we have to do it right.
-That's what we are doing.
Make them compete against each other then sell the film to the highest bidder.
No, not the one highest bidder.
You sell it to the highest bidder in every territory round the world.
You're saying...
-...sell it over and over...
-And over again, yes!
We really are gonna be rich!
(Laughter)
( The Beloved.:
Sweet Harmony)
-l'm sorry, we're right in the middle of things.
-This will only take a moment.
Here you go.
is it right or wrong
Try to find a place
We can all belong
Be as one
Try to get on by lf we unify
We should really try...
Um...
AOB.
Any other business.
I'm thinking of letting Gary go.
Mm.
Seven days later, representatives from 1 1 4 television stations from around the world arrived in London ready to start negotiations.
So, we hired a room at a hotel near Heathrow...
-lt was a business suite.
-Yeah, with a little reception area.
We had free tea and coffee all day.
Photocopying machines.
I mean, we looked great.
We looked like a really professional outfit.
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now... (Gary) Loads of people turned up.
People from Argentina, Brazil, France, Japan...
Where else did they come from?
Germany, Argentina...
-You've said Argentina.
-Brazil?
Yeah.
-China didn't come, did they?
-Most people from...
Quite a few countries.
Time is running out Let there be no doubt
We should sort things out lf we care, like we say we do... I appreciate the offer, Mr González, and we'll give it our utmost consideration once we've seen the offers from the other bidders in Argentina.
You're talking to other TV stations from Argentina?
Three of them, yes, seem very keen.
-But, thanks for this.
-Send the next one in, please.
We don't have any more buyers from Argentina.
Wait a minute!
Let's come together
Right now
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together
Right now...
So, if you sign here...
Oui.
Thank you very much.
All I need now is your cheque.
Cheque?
He told me to bring cash.
In sweet harmony, let's come together...
Did he?
Right now, oh, yeah...
Excusez-moi.
In sweet harmony...
Why did you tell her she had to bring cash?
Have they all been bringing cash?
Look, Ray. I'm taking on the world with you.
UFO nutcases, Hungarian psychos, bring them on, but there is one thing I will never ever mess with and that's the Inland Revenue.
-The cash isn't about me fiddling my taxes.
-What is it about, then?
You said it yourself.
This might be the only time in our lives we get to make money like this and I just want to see it. I want to feel it, Gary, you know, I want to...
I want to touch it and smell it.
I know it sounds stupid but there it is.
Seven hundred and...
And forty-six thousand, nine hundred and ninety...
Seven hundred and forty-seven thousand dollars.
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now... (Morgan) Beautifull (Gary) We'd fooled the world.
-We were sitting on a good sum of money.
-Nice.
-(Ray) ln cash.
-Even nicer.
I mean, it was...it was all perfect.
And then things took a bit of a turn for the worse.
(Gary) Yeah, well, you see, I could have sworn I was being followed.
(Morgan) Are you alleging covert surveillance of Shoefield and Santilli by the US Military?
Your words, not mine.
(Morgan) Was there a cla file on them, then?
Almost certainly.
And, generally speaking, when there's a file there's surveillance.
Generally speaking.
-So, the US military thought the film was real?
-There's more to it than that.
Don't know who he is, but I keep seeing him.
It's starting to freak me out.
Do you know what it probably is?
Probably one of your weird ex-girlfriends.
-l don't have any weirdo ex-girlfriends.
-Oh, come on.
What about that one from Basildon?
Big girl, facial hair, ankles like lampposts.
-Janet.
-Janet!
That's the one.
-(Train rumbles)
-She hung around for weeks, didn't she?
-lt's not Janet.
-Look, whoever it is, put it out of your mind, at least for now.
Think about it.
In two days' time, our film goes out in ninety-eight countries around the world.
-We're going to be famous!
-You still don't get it.
Everyone on the planet is going to know we're liars.
Yeah... rich liars, though.
(Phone)
-(Train rumbles and clatters)
-Hello?
There was no deal allowing you to exploit the film and simply pay me a cut of the profits.
But there was.
We talked about it.
-That was the understanding.
-Not my understanding.
Unless you have, er...some signed paperwork that says otherwise.
(Whispers) Ray.
(Dog barks)
Now that we've cleared that up, let me spell things out for you.
I now control all the deals and we split any cash 80 to 20 to me.
I want to review any agreement you've already made and I alone will decide whether to approve them or not.
(Dog barking)
But...it's going out tomorrow night.
That would be a very grave mistake on your part.
(Dog barking)
(Growls and barks like a dog)
So, what did you do?
The only thing we could do.
We tried to pull the broadcast.
Which is when it happened.
What?
(Ray) Voros was in the middle of a crop circle looking up to the heavens hoping for some sort of close encounter, probably.
It just came out of nowhere.
Alien spacecraft?
No.
A green Land Rover.
-Knocked him over, killed him.
-Dead.
He was naked.
Are you saying that the US military intelligence had Lazlo Voros killed?
Think about it.
If there really was a genuine alien autopsy film, then when Ray Santilli popped up
US military would have been shitting their pants.
All of a sudden there's an extra print of a film that they had kept hidden for 50 years, a print they didn't even know existed.
The biggest secret in the history of the world's about to be blown wide open.
Then they see Santilli's film.
Once they realise the film's a fraud, that Ray's a fraud, then he and the film become the best possible smokescreen they could ever ask for.
All the time that people are looking at Ray Santilli and his stupid film they're not looking at them, and the real film.
They know that Ray's gonna be found out as a faker, which will just bury the truth even deeper, for even longer.
Or, of course, it could just have been an accident.
(Screams)
Do you ever wonder if there's someone up there, looking out for us?
Someone.
Or something.
(Ray) Widescreen.
Got it in specially... (Jasmine) I can't believe it.
This is so exciting.
Could you budge up, Skeletor?
-Here's Maurice.
-All right, lover boy?
(Nan) Raymond, did you set the video to record The X-Files?
-All sorted.
They put it on at the same time!
-l think it's a compliment, though.
I still can't believe that our little film is about to be shown in every continent on the planet.
-l know!
-Can you believe it?
-...based on all available information.
-lt's starting!
If what you are about to see is real, it's the most startling film footage in history.
Although we remain sceptical, some believe this is authentic footage of an alien life form.
Real or not, I must warn you, this appears to be an actual autopsy and some of the footage you will see is very gruesome.

(Frakes) Alien Autopsy.: fact or fiction?
Here outside Roswell is where the alleged crash happened some 50 years ago.
Was it a flying saucer?
Were there alien bodies on board?
People still come and look for some kind of clue.
But the evidence of the alien crash didn't come from here.
It was revealed halfway around the world.
What Santilli saw and purchased were reels of black-and-white film showing an autopsy being performed on a strange humanoid being.
The cameraman, who claims to have had a top military clearance told Santilli that in 1 947 he was flown urgently to Roswell where he filmed the recovery of several of these beings, both alive and dead, as well as the autopsy of one of them.
This could be the world's first look at an actual being from another planet.
The strange body appears intact except for an ugly wound on the right thigh.
Two mysterious doctors wearing contamination suits study its bizarre features.
What the fuck is that?
They are either pathologists or they are surgeons who have done a fair number of autopsies.
This supposedly was filmed in 1 947 and, while things haven't changed, we see some things that would have been expected at that time such as the use of a handsaw in removing the skullcap.
(Frakes) A third person wearing a mask watches from behind the glass partition.
is this indeed a top-secret military autopsy performed on an alien in 1 947?
(Man) This is a structure that must be the brain if it is a human being.
It looks like no brain that I have ever seen, whether it's a brain filled with tumour, a brain that has been radiated a brain that has been traumatised and is haemorrhagic...
What is this?
I would prefer to say for the time being that it is humanoid.
But I cannot say that it is a member of the human race as you and I know the human race.
What if?
What if?
What if the alien is real?
Let's consider.
He was an explorer, perhaps a scientist.
Crashed and died on a distant blue planet, light years from his home.
A frightened race of beings found his lifeless body, performed experiments and hid the results.
Why did he come to our planet?
What went wrong?
Obviously his own mission failed but in his death he may have delivered the most important message mankind has ever received.
We are not alone.
They believe it!
Gary, where have you been?
-What's happened?
-They believe it!
They only believe it!
-Right, you ready for this?
-(Cheering)
( Vic Reeves and the Wonderstuff.:
Dizzy)
Nan!
Have you seen these overnights?
Sh...
Dizzy I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl...
Have you seen these overnights?
(TV) ...surrounded a TV station that was about to broadcast the footage and confiscated the film.
time magazine has described the film, which has sent shock waves across the world and gained the biggest television audience since Live Aid, as the most important home movie since the Zapruder film.
Have you seen these overnights?
-lt's not possible.
-l know!
Clear the schedules.
We're running it again.
When?
Tonight.
(Reporters shout)
My God.
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy...
Bloody hell.
-Hundreds of them.
-(Knocking at door)
-(Doorbell)
-Forget about them.
Do you have any idea what happened to me last night?
-Don't tell me someone actually shagged you?
-Ha-ha (!
)
-(Phone)
-No, I had to barricade myself in my flat.
Five nutcases got up on the roof...
-(Doorbell) -...a load more tried to break in the front door, the phone hasn't stopped ringing for 1 2 hours.
-Everyone wants to see the original film.
-(Knock at door)
-That's fantastic.
-No, it isn't fantastic, because we don't have any film to show them.
The only film we ever did have was shot on modern film stock
-and that is still in Lazlo Voros's safe.
-(Doorbell repeatedly rung)
Maybe we could make another one.
You don't get this, do you?
This film means so much to so many people, Ray.
-Scary people, clinically disturbed people.
-(Knock at door)
Can you imagine what will happen if they ever find out it's a fake?
You know, strictly speaking, it's not actually a fake.
It's more of a remake.
You've got to remember that.
And you've got to relax a bit more, Gary.
Nobody's going to find out anything.
-What are you doing, anyway?
-Packing.
-For what?
-My trip to Argentina.
-What?
-l've been getting calls from chat shows in Buenos Aires, in Lima, Rio, yeah.
They want me to go over, all expenses paid.
-But you can't start going on chat shows.
-Why not?
Has nothing I've said made any sense to you?
They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.
-l can answer anything.
-Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.
-They can't keep changing.
-They won't.
-And how do you know they won't?
-Because I'm taking you with me.

You should, er...get yourself a drink.
It's free.

( Nouvelle Vague.:
Just Can't Get Enough)
(TV presenter speaks Spanish)
Mr Santilli, welcome back.
Now, the cameraman on this trip you made to the US...
He was a dangerous and highly volatile individual who, quite frankly, scared the living daylights out of most people he ever met.
(Speaks Spanish)
(Speaks Spanish)
( American accent) Put the cocktail down, son, or you'll be picking up your teeth with a broken arm.
-(Interviewer) ...cameraman says...
-(Ray) ...to this waiter, and I'm like,
"Hey, now, Manolitol
"Let's just cool our jets here, compadre.
"Otherwise you and me are taking this downtown."
Why can't you grasp this?
There's reporters everywhere.
They'll be checking every word.
Relax.
They're all enjoying it just as much as me.
-(Speaks Spanish) -(Gary) Hi.
-Hi.
-Right here at the front, Señor Santilli.
-You've been upgraded.
-Oh, thank you.
-l'm here.
-(Stewardess) Keep going.
-To the back, next to the toilets.
-(Baby cries)
-Señor Santilli.
-Oh, thank you.
(Gary) Ow!
Oh!
Hmph!
I just can't get enough I just can't get enough...
Well, hello, you.
No way!
-How are you?
-l'm great, how are you?
Are you following me around?
You got me.
Oh, wait, OK.
-Oooh!
-Oh, here we go.
Oh, thank you very much.
(Both) Cheers.
Hey... (Woman) Oh, Rayl Oh, Ray, Rayl

Ooh, yesl Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.
Ohl Yesl -(Ray) Oohl Ohl Ohl
(Woman) No.
Oh.
(They scream and shout)
Pack it in, Santilli!
(Woman) Come on, baby.
Right, I swear to God, if you don't pack it in, I'm going to kill you!
-(Ray) Shh-shh-shhl -(Woman laughs) You be quietl
At last.
(Ray) Amber.
Pretty girl, actually, she was.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
How did that feel?
Having the attention?
You're a celebrity at this point, right?
I didn't like it.
I thought you enjoyed it too much.
Yeah, I mean, I did.
It comes with the territory.
You didn't have to do that, though.
That just drew attention to us.
-No, I think you have to do that.
-Hard to resist, isn't it?
The whole fame thing, I could take it or leave it.
You did too many, wouldn't you say?
You've probably done a few too many chat shows?
Yeah?
( Applause and cheering)
OK, OK, so we're back.
And you were telling me you hooked up at the Plaza Hotel?
That's right, yeah.
Me and Donald Trump, like that.
(Chuckles) That's me on top.
Well, OK, I just...have one final question.
Why have you never produced the original film so it can be verified?
-Excuse me?
The original footage?
-Mm-hm.
Ha!
Exactly.
Answer that, you brainless bloody spanner.
-Er...
-(Man) Where's the original, pal?
-lt's a simple enough question.
-(Loud thud)
-Yeah, yeah.
-Where is it?
Why don't you show it?
(TV off)
-What are you doing?
-(She cries out)
That's Ray's stuff.
Ah, here.
I was looking for a cigarette.
Are you a journalist?
(Gary) What did I tell you?
What did I say?
"Don't do it, Ray." l said, "Don't go on chat shows.
They'll have reporters everywhere."
Do you have any idea how exhausting it is always being right and never being listened to?
When you get angry like this you've got a little vein that pops up...
Shut up!
Thanks to Casanova here, some of the TV stations could sue us for breach of contract.
If they do, the rest'll follow and we'll end up broke and in prison.
-What you talking about, prison?
-No, no, no, no. lt's all right.
Preston?
-Anyone want the last pink wafer?
-So, what do we do?
Well, the only chance we've got is for everyone to stay absolutely silent.
From now on, no one says anything to anyone.
OK?
If we can all do that, then there's just a chance this story'll blow itself out and we can all quietly get on with the rest of our lives.
Quietly's good.
I like quietly.
He's a weirdo. I told you so.
Hey, you know what else we could all do quietly, don't you?
That is just what we need, another biscuit.
We could all, really quietly spend some of this lovely money.
(Laughter)
No.
No.
No.
-Why not?
-Because it's like we've robbed a bank.
-And the one thing any robber knows...
-Never spend the money too soon.
He's right.
Exactly. lt just draws attention to yourself.
Look, if we want to get away with this, we're gonna have to wait till everything dies down.
No more talk about the money till I say so.
When did your say-so become so much more important than...say, my say-so?
(Snorts)
(Door shuts)
-(Laser fire)
-Yaaahhhl
(Knock at door)
-Who is it?
-(Woman) Hello?
-(Knock at door)
-Wait a minute.
Hi.
Hi, there.
Thank you.
Hi, I'm Amber Fuentes from Channel Five News and we are looking for a Harvey Jarrold and we feel that he may live somewhere around here.
Oh, Harvey, yeah. I'll see if he's available.
-Well, maybe we could wait inside.
-No.
Come on!
Stupid idiots!
Slimy bastards.
Gary!
Gary!
Gary?
Gary?
There you are.
You've got to help me.
I'm not talking to you, Ray.
-Where have you been?
-Doing my laundry.
-We're in real trouble here, Gary.
-Shoes!
Sorry, sorry.
(Hoover on)
(Hoover off)
-Are you listening now?
-What?
The press have found Harvey.
Oh.
Now I'm in the middle of God knows where hiding out like a cheap crook, all because of that pile of horse shit you're peddling as my film!
You get rid of that bitch within 48 hours.
And if any other reporters show up,
-l'll blow the whistle on all your asses.
-(Horn blares)
Bastards!
(Morgan) You were busted.
(Ray) Yeah.
So, effectively, the game was up.
There was only one thing I could do.
Kill yourself?
(Both) No.
-He's offering us what?
-An exclusive interview.
-With the cameraman who shot the...
-Actual footage.
Clear the schedules.
But how were you gonna get an interview from a guy that didn't want to be interviewed?
-(Gary) What about him?
-(Ray) No, not old enough.
Hey, look.
That guy.
No, not right.
Him?
(Tyres screech)
Excuse me.
How would you like to make $500 and have a night in a clean hotel room?
What do I have to do?
Just...
learn these lines and say them in front of a camera.
During the Second World War, I was a combat photo... (Coughs) ...tographer for the United States Air Force, a few months after getting...
-Whoa!
-Too much, I know.
...flown to an airbase I'd never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be Ros...well.
I was a combat photographer for the...
United States Airforce.
A few months after my return home from Europe I was rudely awakened in the early hours of the morning and I was flown through the night to an airbase that I had never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be in Roswell, New Mexico.
Shit.
And there in Roswell, I was ordered to film an autopsy being performed... (Sighs) ...on a wretched alien creature apparently extracted from a crashed UFO.
Who the fuck is that?
I'll never forget it.
The stench was unbearable, although I suppose we didn't smell that wonderful to them.
Others of his like were in the back...
-This guy's good.
-This guy's better than Harvey.
Turns out, he used to be an actor.
-An actor?
Perfect.
-Yeah!
He'd made two movies with Lionel Barrymore in 1 935, then after that started drinking.
When we met him, he hadn't had an acting gig in about 40 years.
-You're lucky.
You're very, very lucky.
-Very, very, very.
And there we were sitting upstairs in my nan's house with seven hundred and forty-seven thousand US dollars in a pile like that.
-Bigger, even.
-lt was probably like that.
On my bed.
And, one seventh of it is yours.
Ninety-seven thousand dollars.
There you are, Gary.
Merry Christmas.
Ha-ha!
Thanks.
A seventh of 7 47,000 is about 1 06,700, Ray.
is it?
I know!
Look, I had it all ready for you!
-Get out!
-l did!
You expect me to believe that?
You know what?
I have just one more question.
What was it that you actually saw on the film in Miami?
I mean, there's no way that it was an alien.
So, what was it that gave you the idea?
-l told you.
No one ever believes me.
-Leave it to me.
There's one tiny bit of the story we haven't told you about yet.
-(Doorbell)
-Ah!
-lt's the guy from the film lab.
-Yeah.
And according to him, he'd managed to recover some of the image.
Right.
(Voice echoes) I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corp.
One night in 1 947, I was pulled out of bed
and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where l was ordered to... film this.
Film this.
Film this.
One night in 1 947...
One night in 1 947 to an airbase I'd never heard of...
Told you.
(Snorts)
You know something?
I don't think I can go through this again.
(Snorts) Me neither.
( The Monkees.:
I'm A Believer) I thought love was only true in fairytales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
(Ray) That was ten years ago.
(Morgan) And this has never been exposed?
(Morgan) The world doesn't know this?
(Ray) No.
Until now.
So, the film is still there?
-Right?
-Yeah.
Well, let's go get it.
Michael!
Getting it is exactly what we're gonna do, Morgan.
Just as soon as you've signed this brief deal memo.
What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Oh, then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love...
-l thought you birds was good at multi-tasking.
-l am. I walk and talk and live with you.
Ohl
Sorry there. lt's just instinct.
Looks good, though.
First civilian reaction.
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
(Man on TV) I'll never forget it.
Fucking guy doesn't even look like me!
Then I saw her face...
One can't help but wonder what there is out there.
...of doubt in my mind I'm in love
Maybe we both should have a cigarette?
Eh?
Yes, I saw her face...
-Would you like a biscuit?
-Not now, thank you.
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Said I'm a believer...
But as it rolled out around the world, one of the things that...didn't come back to haunt us but was quite entertaining was that the cameraman who'd sold it to Ray, he had a view that Ray was a foreigner and that selling it to him was the last he'd ever hear of it.

The truth the Pentagon ignored and Roswell kept behind closed doors
The lies that you've been reassured lt just can't be denied if you open your mind
- lf the universe is a place that we call home

Why should we believe that we're here on our own?
We're not alone ls there anyone here with a doubt in their mind?
is there anyone too blind to open their eyes
Realise we're not alone, we're not alone
We've all been abducted We get taken every day
They zap us with their red light and our memory goes away
The proof is in the backyard lt's all buried in the ground
So beam me up like Scotty Let me take a look around
The truth the Pentagon ignored and Roswell kept behind closed doors

Ray, bless his heart, would sell anything that he felt would turn a profit.
That's not entirely true.

(Woman) Hello, Qwerty Films?
Morgan Banner for Michael Kuhn.
-(Buzzer)
-Push the door.
That works.
Good.
Oh, great. lt's dark.
There's no lights here, so careful.
(Man) What is this story?
Michael wouldn't tell me who these people are or what their story is.
So, I don't know.
(Morgan) They're not here?
They'll be up in a minute.
Up in a minute?
I've travelled 4,000 miles for this meeting!
I know, I know, but they won't come up unless I phone them and tell them that you've signed this.
-lt's a confidentiality agreement.
-Jesus!
-l've had enough of this bullshit.
-Morgan, wait!
Michael, what do you think I do?
Just action.
Just... I make documentaries.
They put them in cinemas all over the world for millions of people to watch them.
-l don't make confidential films.
-l realise that.
But this...this thing... this thing these people have done, the thing that I want you to hear, they've kept it secret for ten years, they're not sure how many laws they broke doing it,
and they simply want to know that if you're not interested you won't tell their story to anyone else.
This had better be so good.
-(Footsteps) -(Man # 1 ) Right... (Man #1 ) I'll do all the talking, yeah?
(Man #2) Yeah... (Man #1 ) What are you talking about?
Don't exaggerate.
(Man #1 ) You've got to relax a bit more.
You're too uptight.
Careful!
(Knock on door)
Hi.
You all right?
Uh...my name's Ray Santilli.
-This is my friend, Gary Shoefield.
-All right?
You've...probably never heard of us, though, have you?
Correct.
Why don't you type Ray's name into Google, and see what happens?
-(Morgan) S-A-N-T-l...
-L-L-l.
How many hits?
Three million, nine hundred eighty two thousand... (All) Four hundred and seven.
Yeah.
( Supergrass.:
Alright)
Bet you want to hear their story now.
We are young
We run green Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights Feel alright
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag Put it out
See our friends, see the sights Feel alright
Are we like you?
I can't be sure
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds
But we are young, we get by
Can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around lf we like
But we're alright... (Phone)
-Gary, how you doing?
-How do you think I'm doing?
-You took my car.
-Calm down, Gary.
We discussed this.
Yes, Ray.
We discussed it, and I said no.
Gary, please. lt's only for one day.
Look, whatever you do, don't eat in the car.
OK, mate.
Hey, thanks, Gary.
I appreciate this.
-Ray!
- We run green
Keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights
Feel alright...
-(Man) lf you suspect this is a pirated video...
-You up yet, Nan?
I'm putting the new Woody Harrelson on.
It's called Natural Born Killers.
I think you'll like it.
Just, er...don't stop it once it's started, will you?
-l'm taping it for a couple of friends.
-All right, sweetheart.
-l thought you wanted to watch the film.
-Maybe later, when I get back.
-Back from where?
-My date.
-Your date?
-His name's Maurice. I met him at bingo.
-Where's he taking you?
-Margate for the day.
Oh, I cannot wait.
I haven't been on a date in 47 years.
Now, just hold on. I don't know anything about this Maurice character and if you've just met him, you don't either.
I don't like this one little bit, Nan.
(Doorbell)
Ah...
-Oh, hello. I'm...
-Maurice.
Right.
-This is a first date, yes?
No funny business.
-l'm not sure I under... I want her back by four o'clock, or there'll be trouble.
(Nan) Raymond, go, please.
(Ray) Do we understand each other?
Four o'clock. I'll be waiting.
Nice one, Edgar.
-You get them Babe tapes?
-Yeah, plus a free GoldenEye.
(Ray) Come on, I've got cushions.
I've got pillows.
T-shirts of the The King.
What about you, my darling?
All the way from Vegas.
Oh...
So, are you saying this is a genuine Toy Story video?
Yes. I've got friends in the business.
They look after me.
-You got friends in Hollywood?
-Yeah.
Me and Mr Potato Head are like this.
-That's me on top there, look.
-Eh?
Got something for you.
Here you go, my friend.
Timecop, special edition.
Van Damme has never been better.
I don't want one of your stolen videos, thank you very much.
They're copied, with great care and attention by me.
-You'll have no problem.
-That's where you're right, Mr Santilli.
Islington Council Trading Standards Officer.
And it's you that's got the problem.
Oi!
Arrest him.
(He mouths)
-l told you on the phone, I can't help you.
-You're my lawyer!
I'm not your lawyer. I'm not anyone's lawyer... (Raises voice) ...because I'm not a lawyer.
I'm a clerk, in a legal department.
But they've impounded all me stock.
I have to get it back.
This month's sales are paying for my trip to America.
A buying trip that's gonna transform my whole business.
I'm sorry.
Please go now.
All right.
Help me out of this, and I'll cut you in as well.
You're sitting on my receipts.
I want you to leave.
You can't want to be a legal clerk for the rest of your life.
(Man) Gary, a word in your ear, please.
I'm not going to be.
(Man) Come on, chop-chop.
Come in, have a seat.
I wanted to have a word with you, Gary, because there's going to be an opportunity for a bright young individual that the firm is willing to send back to college to get their law degree and then put on a fast track to top management.
I had heard some rumours.
Because of your experience, your knowledge of this company, and the people working in this company, we wanted to ask you.
Really?
Who you'd choose.
Marcus or Rachel?
It's not easy, is it?
Who would you be more comfortable calling boss?
(Woman) Yes, sir, two portions?
OK.
(Man) You all right, mate?
Best thing that ever happened to you, Gary.
Now you know you've got no future there, tell 'em to shove it.
Look, how are you ever going to date a Page Three girl or drive a Pontiac GTO, working as a lawyer for a biscuit firm?
I don't care what you say, I'm not going to America with you.
Aren't you tired of playing it safe yet?
I mean, take a risk, bet on yourself.
Bet on myself?
Yeah!
-Maybe you're right.
-Course I'm right.
-Why do I need them?
-Exactly.
I could pay for myself to go to law school.
What?
Apply for a place myself, pay the fees myself.
-After we get back from America?
-l'm not going to America.
-But you haven't got any money.
-But I will have, though.
When I sell my car.
Do you have any idea what a mint condition, perfectly restored 1 97 4 Ford Capri goes for these days?
Ray, where's my car?
(Ray) I can sell Elvis stuff standing on my head.
Authentic memorabilia, that's the business we're going into.
You can't still be huffy about the car.
-Why not?
-But look what you've got in its place.
A stake in your own business.
And this time, we're going right to the top.
-Mm.
-Don't want your Sag Aloo?
-No.
-Wicked.
Cheers.
(Ray) The plan was perfect.
Elvis had given a concert in Cleveland in 1 954.
So, we stuck an ad in the local paper saying we were gonna be in town for a few days and we'd pay cash to anybody who had any old photos or, better still, film footage of the King himself performing there 40 years before.
Then the idea was we'd bring it all home, sell it for a fortune.
(Gary) Well, that was the idea.
Gary!
Gary, you've got to come and see this.
-This is Harvey.
-Hello.
(Whispers) Look!
Look at that.
It's the King, performing here 41 years ago.
And it's uncopyrighted.
So, you think you might be interested?
Uh, maybe...maybe.
Condition's not great.
-There's no sound, which is a problem.
-No sound. lt's a problem.
I'll tell you what, why don't we forget the whole thing?
Why don't you go and get some more punch, while I discuss this with my business partner?
Fine, fine.
(Both chuckle)
-Will it be expensive?
-No, I've got him in the palm of my hand.
(Gary) I feel so lonely, baby I feel so lonely
Since my baby left, ooh-ooh I found a new place to dwell, ooh-ooh
Down at the end of lonely street ls Heartbreak Hotel, oh, baby...
Jesus!
You scared the life out of me.
Hang on a minute. lf you've come back about the film, I'm sorry, you're too late.
-A deal's a deal.
-l'm fine with the deal.
You see... I have another piece of film I think you'll be interested in.
-Well, what is it?
-l don't have it with me.
But you've really got to see it, to understand.
-Did you just see that?
-What?
There's a shooting star, just there, right above us.
Yeah, but it's gone now.
Yeah... there are things up there so beautiful sometimes I've cried... just thinking about them.
Beautiful and terrible both.
Well, it's going to be a wild ride for you, Raymond.
Wild, wild ride.
After you.
(Door bangs shut)
This is it.
I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corps.
One night in 1 947... I was pulled out of bed and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where l was ordered to...film this.
(Morgan) All right, just a minute...
Can you say that again?
The film showed the autopsy of an alien being.
It was carried out at Roswell Air Base,
New Mexico in July 1 947.
And you saw the footage?
What did you think?
I didn't see it, you see. I'd had the early night, so I didn't go with him to Florida.
-Didn't you have jet lag?
-No, I drank too much punch, to be honest.
(Both) We had pretty strong punch.
Oh, do me a favour.
Do you have any idea what it would mean if this was actually true?
If you'd actually found documentary proof that man wasn't alone in the universe?
It would be the most important discovery in the history of mankind.
It would change everything forever.
You're telling me out of all the people on the planet you're the one who's been blessed with this discovery?
Isn't it brilliant?
(Sighs) I can't deal with this. I can't deal with another one of your fantastic lies.
But it's not a lie.
Just sell your imaginary film, give me my money back, and we won't talk about it again.
I can't.
Harvey wants $30,000 for the film.
-Where am I gonna get $30,000 from?
-l don't care.
I need an investor to put up the money.
You have to help me.
If you ask me, it wasn't an investor he needed, it was a nutcase who already believed this UFO nonsense.
Fortunately, just the right nutcase happened to share Gary's passion for cars.
(Gary) Lazlo Voros.
(Morgan) This guy was some kind of investor or something?
(Gary) No, he was a psycho Hungarian art dealer who had a booming coke business on the side.
He lived with his Jamaican boyfriend-cum-bodyguard in Belgravia.
I'd met him at a car show in Birmingham, 'cause we're both obsessed with Detroit muscle cars of the 1 97 0s.
And, frankly, he scared the shit out of me.
But Ray was desperate and Voros was a big fan of crop circles.
(Manic laughter)
(Ray) So, Gary made the call.
-Um...hi.
Are you, er...?
-Get in.
OK.
This had better be good, Mr Santilli.
(Muffled cries) ls there someone in the boot?
Just concentrate on telling me about this film.
Well, it's the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen.
Unbelievable.
There it is, in front of me, up on the screen.
Proof that there is life on other planets.
And all I need is thirty grand.
(Voros) Hm.
Why don't we get some air?
(Muffled cries and banging)
(Seagulls cry)
(Voros laughs)
Ah!
You know what I like about the heavens, Mr Santilli?
No.
-All that beauty.
You know what it is?
-No.
Just the remnants of a massive explosion.
Violence is everywhere, and I'm something of a connoisseur when it comes to violence.
(Click)
-(Seagulls cry)
-Are you lying to me about what's on this film?
-(Seagulls' cries intensify)
-No.
No, no.
I swear to you, everything I've told you is absolutely true.
-(Gunshot) -(Bird squawks)
(Splash)
I like you, Ray.
I really do.
You'll have the money tomorrow, in the morning.
(Ray) I...
I'm in pieces by this point.
I am the most scared I have ever been in my life.
-You got the money.
-Don't underestimate how scary it was.
-Oh, no, I'm not.
-lt was a really scary moment.
-But you got the money.
-But don't underestimate how scary... (Morgan) Hang on.
Hang on a minute.
-You got the money and...
-(Ray) We got the money.
-lt's all there?
-lt's all there.
It better be.
I don't want anybody knowing it was me who gave you this.
I'm not signing anything, I'm not banking this money, and there's nobody still alive that knows that I've got this film.
And...
I want it kept that way.
(Ray) That was it, I'd got it.
I'd just pulled off the deal of the century.
(Morgan) lf this is the most secret film in history why did the cameraman end up with it?
I don't get that part.
By mistake.
There are eight prints made of the film.
Four of them and the original negative were sent to Washington.
Three more were sent to Air Force Intelligence in Utah.
The final print goes with Harvey to Florida, where he's told it's going to be picked up.
A week later, the whole world of military intelligence is completely turned on its head.
-The Air Force splits from the Army.
-That's when that happened.
The OSS is broken up and restructured into the ClA.
(Ray) None of the cameraman's contact numbers work anymore.
A year later, the film in Florida still hadn't been picked up.
So, he hung onto it, thinking that some day somebody would just come and get it.
(Gary) But no one ever did.
-Right, OK.
Take a seat, Jasmine.
-(Jasmine) Ooh, sorry, excuse me.
I'm sure you've all heard something about the film that I've just brought back from Florida.
And I'm sure a lot of you think it's just old Ray, up to his old tricks, as usual.
(Laughter)
-Preston, get the curtains.
Run the film.
-Righto, mate.
-(Maurice) Get my specs...
-(Man) lt's a good build-up, mate.
-(Gary) Ready?
-(Preston) Here we go.
- Pah-pah pah-pah pah-pah...
-(Man) Eight, seven, six...
-(Jasmine) Five, four, three...
Just coming. lt's gonna take a minute.
Just coming.
is that it?
Hang on, what's happened to it?
This is fine.
The projector's working fine.
It's the film, I think.
No, that's not right.
-l told you this would be a laugh.
-No, that's not what I saw.
I saw American military bringing a body off the back of a truck.
-This body was an alien. lt was an alien.
-(They laugh)
The alien is just lying there, and then they cut it open and pull out all its guts.
You can see President Truman looking in the viewing glass.
-Excuse me, where's the Rank Film Lab?
-Down there, on your left.
On the left, thank you.
You don't believe me.
-Doesn't matter what I believe.
-lt matters to me.
I really appreciate this, Auntie P.
Jeffrey!
My nephew's got a problem with some film.
Ohh.
Walk this way.
Ah.
Ah-ah-ah.
Ah, look at that.
-1 940s Kodak safety stock.
-(Auntie P) ls it?
You know what the worst thing you can do to a film like this is?
Keep it in sealed containers in a high temperature, high-humidity environment for any length of time.
Well, it's been kept in that can, in a garage in Miami.
For 50 years.
There's your problem.
-(Groans) Smell that?
-(Auntie P) That's bad.
Sort of...vinegary.
That's the film eating itself.
Oh, yeah.
From the moment that can was opened the process will have started.
We'll do what we can but don't hold your breath.
Chances of rescuing anything from this film are virtually non-existent.
-lt was gone?
-(Gary) Yeah.
Meanwhile, I've got Lazlo Voros on the phone.
"Where's my film?
Where is my film?"
-All the time ringing.
-The guy who's had a revolver at my head.
-He's gonna kill me.
What do I tell him?
-The truth.
You've got no other choice.
Oh, really?
And how does that go?
"Hey, Lazlo, I've spent $30,000 of your money on a film that was fine when I saw it
"but now it's eaten itself."
(Thunderclap)
(Excited laughter)
(Man talks quietly and woman laughs)
(Excited laughter)
-(Laughter)
-Yes.
Oh, erm...hello, Raymond.
Don't you "Oh, hello, Raymond" me.
What's going on here?
-(Both) Nothing.
-l was just...
I was just leaving.
(Raucous laughter)
What happens with my nan in my house is my business.
-Whether you like it or not.
-Oh!
I tho...
I thought it was your nan's house.
That's beside the point.
How old are you, anyway?
A hundred and two.
Have you got a job?
Or a pension?
-l run my own business.
-Really?
Doing what exactly?
I make those.
My family's been making them for generations.
Harvey Nicks, Harrods, Selfridges...
There's not a shape or size or shop in London we haven't supplied at some point in the last 1 50 years.
It's the most perfect idea.
Last night the answer suddenly came to me.
Maurice can make us an alien.
Then I can film it.
-Film it?
-l know what I saw.
All we do is copy it.
You can't even take a photograph of your nan without cropping her head off.
-How are you gonna shoot an alien autopsy?
-Not me.
Melik.
-Melik runs a kebab shop!
-At weekends he shoots wedding videos.
( Stereo MCs.:
Step lt Up)
Preston can bring in some meat offcuts to be the internal organs.
Edgar does up corpses for open-casket funerals.
He can do make-up.
Jasmine's dad's in antiques.
She can source the props.
Hold on.
Where are you going to shoot this Oscar-winning production?
-Your sister's not back from Ibiza till Sunday.
-No.
-Her flat would be perfect.
-No!
This is never going to work.
Count me out.
Thanks, Gary.
And, hey, I appreciate it.
-Jasmine, we're making a movie.
-l'm not taking my top off again.
Or seeing what I see
Curves with destinations
Poetic symmetry
You cause an inflammation ln my anatomy, don't you see
Yeah, yeah, yeah You can send a forget-me-not
Yeah, yeah, yeah But I'll still reach up to the top
Yeah, yeah, yeah Until the last day that I drop
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To the left
To the right
Keep it going, keep it going, it's alright
To the left
And to the right
Step it up, step it up, it's alright
We want flesh
We want flesh
We want flesh
(Preston) All right?
- All you gotta do is bounce it...
-(Preston) Eurgh!
To see just what goes where
There ain't no way around it...
Can't you just tell me?
-l want to know if it's any good or not.
-(Melik) Any good?
You're working with the best.
-Show me.
-Here we go.
And...open them.
-l'm a genius.
-(All) Eh?
-(Gary) You what?
-l mean...you're a genius.
And you.
-All of you, just all genius...
-(Laughter)
Great.
That's just half of it.
Wait till you see the rest.
We've still got a couple of adjustments to make, but you'll get the basic idea.
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.
-Ta-da!
-(They gasp)
(Jasmine) Oh.
We remoulded an old maternity mannequin we used to make for Mothercare.
Added an extra finger to each hand, and extra toes.
And...see the skull?
Maurice has done it in a special latex, so we can peel the skin back on camera.
We got some mince and some pig's blood balled up in some lady's tights inside.
It'll look just like the exposed brain.
-(Maurice) Are the crash wounds right?
-They're perfect.
The whole thing is just...
exactly like what I saw on the film.
Exactly.
So, we're on, then?
For tonight?
-Yeah.
-Good.
Oh, cheer up, Gary.
Cheer up?
What do you expect?
I've got an alien lying with its arse in my sister's kitchen sink.
-(Ray) Ready?
-l just want to try something with the lights.
-(Jasmine) Would you turn the light...
-One second.
Oh, is that...actual blood?
-lt's pig's blood mixed with food dye.
-(Gary) Eh?
Got the rest of the guts in the corner, by the sofa.
And some flat rib.
Some boneless loin.
A few pounds of braising mince.
And 1 5 packets of sliced ham.
-What's the ham for?
-Sandwiches.
Yeah, I'm a hyphenate.
-Special effects...hyphen...
location catering.
-Right.
First positions, please, everyone.
-Hey, hey, hey!
Look!
-You want me to mop that up?
-Yeah.
-No, don't touch it!
That's well proper. lt looks authentic.
Are you the director?
No, me.
Thank you.
-Extras, could you clear the set, please?
-Good luck, darling.
I need to talk to the actors.
Right!
Boys.
This is your first look at the alien.
Opening scene.
You two?
You're at Roswell.
Area 51 .
So, what I want is a bit of pointing.
Bit of nodding.
You're a natural.
Exactly, just like that.
Bit of pointing, bit of nodding.
Loads of energy.
Remember that you are professionals.
You're excited professionals.
-OK.
Feel it.
First positions.
We'll do a take.
-(Gary) Ridiculous.
Put your hat on.
We'll start from here, then I'll call you in.
-OK.
And...
-lt's not on properly.
-Get off!
-...action!
is mine all right?
(Melik) Edgar, take your position.
That's good.
No, don't wave.
Muppet.
-Try that pointing thing you do.
-Like this?
Yeah, just like that. lt's wicked.
-Cooee!
-(Ray and Gary) Hi, Nan.
-Play with the belly.
-(Gary) This is ridiculous.
(Ray) Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
Stop crying.
Get on with it, will you?
Look, out the way!
-(Melik) Prod it.
-Not like that.
-l'm out...
-Let me do it, like this.
-You're the director now, are you?
-Shut up, we're shooting a movie here!
-Shut up.
-No, you shut up.
Cut!
You just ruined my shot.
(Gary) Nice leg of lamb, this.
-(Ray) Good traction on it, Preston.
-That'll be the mint sauce.
-(Ray) Nice one.
-This is good.
-Oh!
-(Jasmine) I don't believe it.
(Chuckles and sighs)
-lt's all right.
-(Gary) You all right?
(Jasmine) Eugh.
(Melik) That's it.
Ooh, yes, it's looking good.
-(Ray) That looks good.
-That's good.
-Would you like a biscuit?
-Nan!
(Melik) Don't worry, we'll deal with that in the cut.
Yeah, I will, as it happens.
is that a Jammie Dodger?
-(Ray) Get your fingers in there.
-That's all right.
Should we go for the heart next, Ray?
Keep it going.
What does he think he's doing?
-ls he taking the piss?
-Stop messing about!
And...action.
(Melik) Ray, come round the other side.
Sausage on a stick?
-Nan, please!
-Cut!
Cut!
For crying out loud!
-ls someone wrangling Ray's nan?
-Maurice...
-l can't hear you!
-He's got her in the kitchen.
-Keep her there.
Has Jasmine spritzed?
-No, just getting a refill.
OK, now, let's get down and dirty with the intestines.
Go on, Gary, get in there.
(Gary) What on earth is that?
It stinks.
Careful. I'm gonna use that in the shop tomorrow for some sausages and burgers.
(Jasmine) Eurgh.
(Ray) Careful.
(Melik) Right.
That's good.
(Ray) Easy.
Careful with these.
(Melik) God!
-l think it's too real.
-lt's a nice touch.
It's looking at me.
(Melik) OK, this is good.
Right, let's...
let's get ready to...
-...peel back the skin.
-(Gary) Got it, Ray?
(Ray) Yeah.
(Gary) lt looks like raspberry jelly.
(Ray) Yeah, it is raspberry jelly.
(Melik) Give it to Gary.
Make out like there's a real tough, tough bone there. lt's a tough skull.
(Gary) Like that?
(Ray) Go on.
There.
(Melik) That's good.
That's very good.
(Ray) Lovely.
Now, gently...place the brain on the tray.
-Right.
-Gently.
-(Gary) Ready?
-Yeah.
Oh, no!
Mind the brain!
(Gary) Ah... (Gary) Ah, the carpet!
-Cut!
Cut, cut, cut!
-(Gary) Ah...she's gonna kill us.
Don't worry, Gaz.
Put a bit of salt on that.
-Are you sure?
Isn't it salt and wine?
-No, it's for red wine you put...
-(Melik) lt's salt and white wine.
-Put a pot plant on it.
I don't know what else is in the skull so, Preston, please tell me it's gonna work.
Brain's sorted.
No more slippage.
(Melik) OK.
OK, good.
Action!
OK, easy does it, easy.
OK, ready, Ray?
Ready?
Wait!
Cut!
-What the hell is that?
-That would be the stuffed sheep's stomach.
Dash of garlic, 90 minutes at gas mark 4, a highly nutritious meal for a family of five.
That's great.
Our alien travels millions of light years across the universe with nothing but a haggis to guide him?
-lt's not slipping, though, is it?
-(Key in lock)
(Gary) Uh!
(He sighs)
Doreen!
How was Ibiza?
-(Ray) Now, Doreen, don't fly off the handle.
-(She gasps)
-lt's not what it looks like, OK?
-No.
I can explain everything.
Shall we call that a day?
-(Ray) lt won't fit.
-(Gary) lt will, just shove it in.
-What are we doing here?
-This was your idea.
I don't just mean this. I mean the shoot. I mean the whole thing. lt's a complete disaster.
It's not a complete disaster.
I mean, bits of it were quite good.
Bits of it?
-Would you show that film to Lazlo Voros?
-No.
No. I'm a dead man, aren't I?
Not necessarily.
You're the worst liar I have ever met.
Yeah, but that's the difference between you and me, Ray.
That's why you stand a chance with Voros.
Bet on yourself. lsn't that what you said?
-What?
-The bloody head doesn't fit.
(Dogs bark)
(Heavy Caribbean accent) ls what you a-look 'pon?
-Um...what?
-Voros ready to see you now.
Follow me.
(Sobbing)
Follow me.
Mr Voros, good evening.
Lovely to see you again.
If you speak to me again without being spoken to first, I will happily sit here flossing my teeth while Zachary is breaking every single bone in your body.
-Mm.
-ls that the film?
-Mm-hm.
-(Man sobs)
-( Tricky.:
Aftermath)
-Mm!
Zachary, darling?
Run it.
For one poor boy
There's someone
For he
For she
For one poor boy
There's someone...
Um...
Did...did you, er...?
The...
I mean, what did you...think?
Oh, God.
-Look, I'm sorry, Mr Voros.
-This is the most... beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
(Sobs)
We are not alone.
Ray, you proved it, once and for all.
You proved it.
( Tom Jones.:
If I Only Knew)
Thank you, Ray.
Yeah
Home grown, on the bone
All the channels show the same old war zone As I walk alone in the city
Making me an offer Now don't they look pretty...
-Yes!
-Hugged you?
Proper hugged me.
I still can't believe it myself.
You know what this means?
If Voros bought it, maybe other people will as well.
We should run off a few hundred copies for the cornershops who bought my Elvis videos.
If we got £1 0.99 a pop and shifted, say, a thousand of them, that'd be...
-Eleven grand.
-Eleven grand.
-So, I had this idea.
-l had the idea.
-Well...
-lt was...
Gary's idea was to invite all of the cornershop owners to a screening of the footage but do it somewhere impressive.
-To get the credibility up a little bit?
-Yeah.
See, I thought the grander the place was, the more excited the buyers might be and even start bidding against each other.
Raise the price.
And fortunately there was one very grand place who happened to have a room free.
The Natural History Museum.
-No way.
-Yeah, that's exactly what they said.
-Oh, not there?
-(Both) No.
-So, we had to find somewhere else.
-The Museum of London.
-Don't know that place.
-No, not many do.
But it was perfect.
They didn't ask too many questions.
The key thing was to keep the screening quiet.
-What you did is invite just a few?
-Yeah.
And apart from that we would keep it absolutely secret.
-(Crowd shouting)
-There's hundreds of people out there.
The Chief Constable is worried about losing control.
I don't care.
This is my screening and I'm not letting them in.
I'm not going to be blamed for causing a riot in front of the national press.
The national press are here?
The Sun, the Mirror, two television crews.
(Crowd) Let us in!
Let us in!
Not bad for a little press release to the local paper, eh?
You idiot!
There's no way this many people are gonna believe that film.
The national press'll see right through it.
It's a chance worth taking.
You can't buy publicity like this.
-(Klaxon) -l say we do it.
No.
Absolutely, categorically...
Yes, £5 a seat, madam.
Thank you, come on in.
(Tutting)
-You hear that?
-l can't hear anything.
Exactly.
They're not laughing.
( Audience gasps)
(Excited chatter)
(Shouting)
This just came in from London.
-Director know about this?
-He's waiting for you now, sir.
And the next day...
"ls it real?" "Man from Mars". "UFO".
Our alien, full of sausages, was on the front page of every newspaper around the world.
Raymond, there's a man on the phone from Argentina.
-Take a number, Nan. I'll call him back.
-Right.
-(Melik) I've got a woman from Italian TV.
-He cannot speak to you now...
-l'm going to have to get back to them.
-...but give me your number...
-l appreciate your interest.
-...and he will call you back.
-Can I call you back?
-That's us.
-No, I promise.
All right.
OK, bye-bye.
-Yes.
-That's us on the telly.
-lt's been like this all day.
Every TV station in the world wants our film, Gary.
-There's hundreds of them.
-Buenos dias.
Bye, pet.
I have absolutely no idea how we've done this.
But since we have, and it's the only opportunity we'll ever have to make any money at all,
-we have to do it right.
-That's what we are doing.
Make them compete against each other then sell the film to the highest bidder.
No, not the one highest bidder.
You sell it to the highest bidder in every territory round the world.
You're saying...
-...sell it over and over...
-And over again, yes!
We really are gonna be rich!
(Laughter)
( The Beloved.:
Sweet Harmony)
-l'm sorry, we're right in the middle of things.
-This will only take a moment.
Here you go.
is it right or wrong
Try to find a place
We can all belong
Be as one
Try to get on by lf we unify
We should really try...
Um...
AOB.
Any other business.
I'm thinking of letting Gary go.
Mm.
Seven days later, representatives from 1 1 4 television stations from around the world arrived in London ready to start negotiations.
So, we hired a room at a hotel near Heathrow...
-lt was a business suite.
-Yeah, with a little reception area.
We had free tea and coffee all day.
Photocopying machines.
I mean, we looked great.
We looked like a really professional outfit.
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now... (Gary) Loads of people turned up.
People from Argentina, Brazil, France, Japan...
Where else did they come from?
Germany, Argentina...
-You've said Argentina.
-Brazil?
Yeah.
-China didn't come, did they?
-Most people from...
Quite a few countries.
Time is running out Let there be no doubt
We should sort things out lf we care, like we say we do... I appreciate the offer, Mr González, and we'll give it our utmost consideration once we've seen the offers from the other bidders in Argentina.
You're talking to other TV stations from Argentina?
Three of them, yes, seem very keen.
-But, thanks for this.
-Send the next one in, please.
We don't have any more buyers from Argentina.
Wait a minute!
Let's come together
Right now
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together
Right now...
So, if you sign here...
Oui.
Thank you very much.
All I need now is your cheque.
Cheque?
He told me to bring cash.
In sweet harmony, let's come together...
Did he?
Right now, oh, yeah...
Excusez-moi.
In sweet harmony...
Why did you tell her she had to bring cash?
Have they all been bringing cash?
Look, Ray. I'm taking on the world with you.
UFO nutcases, Hungarian psychos, bring them on, but there is one thing I will never ever mess with and that's the Inland Revenue.
-The cash isn't about me fiddling my taxes.
-What is it about, then?
You said it yourself.
This might be the only time in our lives we get to make money like this and I just want to see it. I want to feel it, Gary, you know, I want to...
I want to touch it and smell it.
I know it sounds stupid but there it is.
Seven hundred and...
And forty-six thousand, nine hundred and ninety...
Seven hundred and forty-seven thousand dollars.
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now
Oh, yeah ln sweet harmony
Let's come together right now... (Morgan) Beautifull (Gary) We'd fooled the world.
-We were sitting on a good sum of money.
-Nice.
-(Ray) ln cash.
-Even nicer.
I mean, it was...it was all perfect.
And then things took a bit of a turn for the worse.
(Gary) Yeah, well, you see, I could have sworn I was being followed.
(Morgan) Are you alleging covert surveillance of Shoefield and Santilli by the US Military?
Your words, not mine.
(Morgan) Was there a cla file on them, then?
Almost certainly.
And, generally speaking, when there's a file there's surveillance.
Generally speaking.
-So, the US military thought the film was real?
-There's more to it than that.
Don't know who he is, but I keep seeing him.
It's starting to freak me out.
Do you know what it probably is?
Probably one of your weird ex-girlfriends.
-l don't have any weirdo ex-girlfriends.
-Oh, come on.
What about that one from Basildon?
Big girl, facial hair, ankles like lampposts.
-Janet.
-Janet!
That's the one.
-(Train rumbles)
-She hung around for weeks, didn't she?
-lt's not Janet.
-Look, whoever it is, put it out of your mind, at least for now.
Think about it.
In two days' time, our film goes out in ninety-eight countries around the world.
-We're going to be famous!
-You still don't get it.
Everyone on the planet is going to know we're liars.
Yeah... rich liars, though.
(Phone)
-(Train rumbles and clatters)
-Hello?
There was no deal allowing you to exploit the film and simply pay me a cut of the profits.
But there was.
We talked about it.
-That was the understanding.
-Not my understanding.
Unless you have, er...some signed paperwork that says otherwise.
(Whispers) Ray.
(Dog barks)
Now that we've cleared that up, let me spell things out for you.
I now control all the deals and we split any cash 80 to 20 to me.
I want to review any agreement you've already made and I alone will decide whether to approve them or not.
(Dog barking)
But...it's going out tomorrow night.
That would be a very grave mistake on your part.
(Dog barking)
(Growls and barks like a dog)
So, what did you do?
The only thing we could do.
We tried to pull the broadcast.
Which is when it happened.
What?
(Ray) Voros was in the middle of a crop circle looking up to the heavens hoping for some sort of close encounter, probably.
It just came out of nowhere.
Alien spacecraft?
No.
A green Land Rover.
-Knocked him over, killed him.
-Dead.
He was naked.
Are you saying that the US military intelligence had Lazlo Voros killed?
Think about it.
If there really was a genuine alien autopsy film, then when Ray Santilli popped up
US military would have been shitting their pants.
All of a sudden there's an extra print of a film that they had kept hidden for 50 years, a print they didn't even know existed.
The biggest secret in the history of the world's about to be blown wide open.
Then they see Santilli's film.
Once they realise the film's a fraud, that Ray's a fraud, then he and the film become the best possible smokescreen they could ever ask for.
All the time that people are looking at Ray Santilli and his stupid film they're not looking at them, and the real film.
They know that Ray's gonna be found out as a faker, which will just bury the truth even deeper, for even longer.
Or, of course, it could just have been an accident.
(Screams)
Do you ever wonder if there's someone up there, looking out for us?
Someone.
Or something.
(Ray) Widescreen.
Got it in specially... (Jasmine) I can't believe it.
This is so exciting.
Could you budge up, Skeletor?
-Here's Maurice.
-All right, lover boy?
(Nan) Raymond, did you set the video to record The X-Files?
-All sorted.
They put it on at the same time!
-l think it's a compliment, though.
I still can't believe that our little film is about to be shown in every continent on the planet.
-l know!
-Can you believe it?
-...based on all available information.
-lt's starting!
If what you are about to see is real, it's the most startling film footage in history.
Although we remain sceptical, some believe this is authentic footage of an alien life form.
Real or not, I must warn you, this appears to be an actual autopsy and some of the footage you will see is very gruesome.

(Frakes) Alien Autopsy.: fact or fiction?
Here outside Roswell is where the alleged crash happened some 50 years ago.
Was it a flying saucer?
Were there alien bodies on board?
People still come and look for some kind of clue.
But the evidence of the alien crash didn't come from here.
It was revealed halfway around the world.
What Santilli saw and purchased were reels of black-and-white film showing an autopsy being performed on a strange humanoid being.
The cameraman, who claims to have had a top military clearance told Santilli that in 1 947 he was flown urgently to Roswell where he filmed the recovery of several of these beings, both alive and dead, as well as the autopsy of one of them.
This could be the world's first look at an actual being from another planet.
The strange body appears intact except for an ugly wound on the right thigh.
Two mysterious doctors wearing contamination suits study its bizarre features.
What the fuck is that?
They are either pathologists or they are surgeons who have done a fair number of autopsies.
This supposedly was filmed in 1 947 and, while things haven't changed, we see some things that would have been expected at that time such as the use of a handsaw in removing the skullcap.
(Frakes) A third person wearing a mask watches from behind the glass partition.
is this indeed a top-secret military autopsy performed on an alien in 1 947?
(Man) This is a structure that must be the brain if it is a human being.
It looks like no brain that I have ever seen, whether it's a brain filled with tumour, a brain that has been radiated a brain that has been traumatised and is haemorrhagic...
What is this?
I would prefer to say for the time being that it is humanoid.
But I cannot say that it is a member of the human race as you and I know the human race.
What if?
What if?
What if the alien is real?
Let's consider.
He was an explorer, perhaps a scientist.
Crashed and died on a distant blue planet, light years from his home.
A frightened race of beings found his lifeless body, performed experiments and hid the results.
Why did he come to our planet?
What went wrong?
Obviously his own mission failed but in his death he may have delivered the most important message mankind has ever received.
We are not alone.
They believe it!
Gary, where have you been?
-What's happened?
-They believe it!
They only believe it!
-Right, you ready for this?
-(Cheering)
( Vic Reeves and the Wonderstuff.:
Dizzy)
Nan!
Have you seen these overnights?
Sh...
Dizzy I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning
Like a whirlpool, it never ends
And it's you, girl...
Have you seen these overnights?
(TV) ...surrounded a TV station that was about to broadcast the footage and confiscated the film.
time magazine has described the film, which has sent shock waves across the world and gained the biggest television audience since Live Aid, as the most important home movie since the Zapruder film.
Have you seen these overnights?
-lt's not possible.
-l know!
Clear the schedules.
We're running it again.
When?
Tonight.
(Reporters shout)
My God.
And it's you, girl, making it spin
You're making me dizzy...
Bloody hell.
-Hundreds of them.
-(Knocking at door)
-(Doorbell)
-Forget about them.
Do you have any idea what happened to me last night?
-Don't tell me someone actually shagged you?
-Ha-ha (!
)
-(Phone)
-No, I had to barricade myself in my flat.
Five nutcases got up on the roof...
-(Doorbell) -...a load more tried to break in the front door, the phone hasn't stopped ringing for 1 2 hours.
-Everyone wants to see the original film.
-(Knock at door)
-That's fantastic.
-No, it isn't fantastic, because we don't have any film to show them.
The only film we ever did have was shot on modern film stock
-and that is still in Lazlo Voros's safe.
-(Doorbell repeatedly rung)
Maybe we could make another one.
You don't get this, do you?
This film means so much to so many people, Ray.
-Scary people, clinically disturbed people.
-(Knock at door)
Can you imagine what will happen if they ever find out it's a fake?
You know, strictly speaking, it's not actually a fake.
It's more of a remake.
You've got to remember that.
And you've got to relax a bit more, Gary.
Nobody's going to find out anything.
-What are you doing, anyway?
-Packing.
-For what?
-My trip to Argentina.
-What?
-l've been getting calls from chat shows in Buenos Aires, in Lima, Rio, yeah.
They want me to go over, all expenses paid.
-But you can't start going on chat shows.
-Why not?
Has nothing I've said made any sense to you?
They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.
-l can answer anything.
-Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.
-They can't keep changing.
-They won't.
-And how do you know they won't?
-Because I'm taking you with me.

Mr Santilli, welcome back.
Now, the cameraman on this trip you made to the US...
He was a dangerous and highly volatile individual who, quite frankly, scared the living daylights out of most people he ever met.
(Speaks Spanish)
(Speaks Spanish)
( American accent) Put the cocktail down, son, or you'll be picking up your teeth with a broken arm.

-(Ray) ...to this waiter, and I'm like,
"Hey, now, Manolitol
"Let's just cool our jets here, compadre.
"Otherwise you and me are taking this downtown."

There's reporters everywhere.
They'll be checking every word.

-(Ray) Shh-shh-shhl -(Woman laughs) You be quietl
At last.
(Ray) Amber.
Pretty girl, actually, she was.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
How did that feel?
Having the attention?
You're a celebrity at this point, right?
I didn't like it.
I thought you enjoyed it too much.
Yeah, I mean, I did.
It comes with the territory.
You didn't have to do that, though.
That just drew attention to us.
-No, I think you have to do that.
-Hard to resist, isn't it?
The whole fame thing, I could take it or leave it.
You did too many, wouldn't you say?
You've probably done a few too many chat shows?
Yeah?
( Applause and cheering)
OK, OK, so we're back.
And you were telling me you hooked up at the Plaza Hotel?
That's right, yeah.
Me and Donald Trump, like that.
(Chuckles) That's me on top.
Well, OK, I just...have one final question.
Why have you never produced the original film so it can be verified?
-Excuse me?
The original footage?
-Mm-hm.
Ha!
Exactly.
Answer that, you brainless bloody spanner.
-Er...
-(Man) Where's the original, pal?
-lt's a simple enough question.
-(Loud thud)
-Yeah, yeah.
-Where is it?
Why don't you show it?
(TV off)
-What are you doing?
-(She cries out)
That's Ray's stuff.
Ah, here.
I was looking for a cigarette.
Are you a journalist?
(Gary) What did I tell you?
What did I say?
"Don't do it, Ray." l said, "Don't go on chat shows.
They'll have reporters everywhere."
Do you have any idea how exhausting it is always being right and never being listened to?
When you get angry like this you've got a little vein that pops up...
Shut up!
Thanks to Casanova here, some of the TV stations could sue us for breach of contract.
If they do, the rest'll follow and we'll end up broke and in prison.
-What you talking about, prison?
-No, no, no, no. lt's all right.
Preston?
-Anyone want the last pink wafer?
-So, what do we do?
Well, the only chance we've got is for everyone to stay absolutely silent.
From now on, no one says anything to anyone.
OK?
If we can all do that, then there's just a chance this story'll blow itself out and we can all quietly get on with the rest of our lives.
Quietly's good.
I like quietly.
He's a weirdo. I told you so.
Hey, you know what else we could all do quietly, don't you?
That is just what we need, another biscuit.
We could all, really quietly spend some of this lovely money.
(Laughter)
No.
No.
No.
-Why not?
-Because it's like we've robbed a bank.
-And the one thing any robber knows...
-Never spend the money too soon.
He's right.
Exactly. lt just draws attention to yourself.
Look, if we want to get away with this, we're gonna have to wait till everything dies down.
No more talk about the money till I say so.
When did your say-so become so much more important than...say, my say-so?

Hi, I'm Amber Fuentes from Channel Five News and we are looking for a Harvey Jarrold and we feel that he may live somewhere around here.
Oh, Harvey, yeah. I'll see if he's available.

-No.

(Morgan) You were busted.
(Ray) Yeah.
So, effectively, the game was up.
There was only one thing I could do.
Kill yourself?
(Both) No.
-He's offering us what?
-An exclusive interview.
-With the cameraman who shot the...
-Actual footage.
Clear the schedules.
But how were you gonna get an interview from a guy that didn't want to be interviewed?
-(Gary) What about him?
-(Ray) No, not old enough.
Hey, look.
That guy.
No, not right.
Him?
(Tyres screech)
Excuse me.
How would you like to make $500 and have a night in a clean hotel room?
What do I have to do?
Just...
learn these lines and say them in front of a camera.
During the Second World War, I was a combat photo... (Coughs) ...tographer for the United States Air Force, a few months after getting...
-Whoa!
-Too much, I know.
...flown to an airbase I'd never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be Ros...well.
I was a combat photographer for the...
United States Airforce.
A few months after my return home from Europe I was rudely awakened in the early hours of the morning and I was flown through the night to an airbase that I had never heard of.
An airbase that turned out to be in Roswell, New Mexico.
Shit.
And there in Roswell, I was ordered to film an autopsy being performed... (Sighs) ...on a wretched alien creature apparently extracted from a crashed UFO.
Who the fuck is that?
I'll never forget it.
The stench was unbearable, although I suppose we didn't smell that wonderful to them.
Others of his like were in the back...
-This guy's good.
-This guy's better than Harvey.
Turns out, he used to be an actor.
-An actor?
Perfect.
-Yeah!
He'd made two movies with Lionel Barrymore in 1 935, then after that started drinking.
When we met him, he hadn't had an acting gig in about 40 years.
-You're lucky.
You're very, very lucky.
-Very, very, very.
And there we were sitting upstairs in my nan's house with seven hundred and forty-seven thousand US dollars in a pile like that.
-Bigger, even.
-lt was probably like that.
On my bed.
And, one seventh of it is yours.
Ninety-seven thousand dollars.
There you are, Gary.
Merry Christmas.
Ha-ha!
Thanks.
A seventh of 7 47,000 is about 1 06,700, Ray.
is it?
I know!
Look, I had it all ready for you!
-Get out!
-l did!
You expect me to believe that?
You know what?
I have just one more question.
What was it that you actually saw on the film in Miami?
I mean, there's no way that it was an alien.
So, what was it that gave you the idea?
-l told you.
No one ever believes me.
-Leave it to me.
There's one tiny bit of the story we haven't told you about yet.
-(Doorbell)
-Ah!
-lt's the guy from the film lab.
-Yeah.
And according to him, he'd managed to recover some of the image.
Right.
(Voice echoes) I was a combat photographer for the United States Air Corp.
One night in 1 947, I was pulled out of bed
and flown for five hours to an airbase that I'd never heard of where l was ordered to... film this.
Film this.
Film this.
One night in 1 947...
One night in 1 947 to an airbase I'd never heard of...
Told you.
(Snorts)
You know something?
I don't think I can go through this again.
(Snorts) Me neither.
( The Monkees.:
I'm A Believer) I thought love was only true in fairytales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all my dreams
Then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
(Ray) That was ten years ago.
(Morgan) And this has never been exposed?
(Morgan) The world doesn't know this?
(Ray) No.
Until now.
So, the film is still there?
-Right?
-Yeah.
Well, let's go get it.
Michael!
Getting it is exactly what we're gonna do, Morgan.
Just as soon as you've signed this brief deal memo.
What's the use in trying?
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
Oh, then I saw her face
Now I'm a believer
Not a trace of doubt in my mind I'm in love...
-l thought you birds was good at multi-tasking.
-l am. I walk and talk and live with you.
Ohl
Sorry there. lt's just instinct.
Looks good, though.
First civilian reaction.
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
(Man on TV) I'll never forget it.
Fucking guy doesn't even look like me!
Then I saw her face...
One can't help but wonder what there is out there.
...of doubt in my mind I'm in love
Maybe we both should have a cigarette?
Eh?
Yes, I saw her face...
-Would you like a biscuit?
-Not now, thank you.
Not a trace of doubt in my mind
Said I'm a believer...
But as it rolled out around the world, one of the things that...didn't come back to haunt us but was quite entertaining was that the cameraman who'd sold it to Ray, he had a view that Ray was a foreigner and that selling it to him was the last he'd ever hear of it.

Confrontation
Within the spreading darkness
I pledged a vow to the revolution
I can't let anybody interrupt it
I'm going to change
The future that the forbidden fruit foretells...
I'm going to change the dream into reality
The ending that everybody wants.
Within the spreading darkness
I pledged our vow to the revolution
I can't let anybody interrupt it
Someday I'll show you
A bright and ideal world.
The human whose name is written in this note shall die.
Please...
Takuo Shibuimaru Accidental Death
- Stop!
- Now let's see...
What'll happen!
The Death Note is real!
Don't think for a moment, that any human who's used the Death Note can go to Heaven, or Hell.
I want the world to know...
of my existence!
That there is someone is passing judgment on them!
And I will become... the god of this new world!
I had no idea what he was thinking, so I'm through with him.
Really?
Then how was it with that other old guy?
Mr. Yagami.
Please translate that sentence into Japanese.
Yes.
"When finally, he fully succeeded in making his dream a reality, he was immersed in beatitude."
Very good.
As usual, a perfect answer.
Well then, class is dismissed.
It's finally over.
School sure is boring.
Hey, Light!
Light, are you listening to me?
Don't talk to me.
Others can hear my voice when I talk unlike yours.
You're so boring.
Hey, Light!
We're going to go--
Sorry, I have something to do.
You don't have anything to do.
Aren't you just going home like you usually do?
What are you talking about?
I have something to do.
Something very important.
Yamada is suspected of stabbing a fellow employee in the abdomen at a restaurant in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, yesterday.
The knife was from the restaurant and was roughly twelve inches long.
- Hey!
- The suspect said...
- Hey, Light!
- "he was being rude, so I just lost it. "
What is it?
You sure are working very hard.
I can't waste any time.
I only have a limited amount of time to write names in the notebook...
The only time I have is when I get home from school and until I go to bed.
I also need to maintain my grades.
I can't sleep during class.
I need to do all of my homework for school and my prep classes.
Lack of sleep is dangerous.
It'll affect my health and concentration.
After all, I'm trying to change this world into a utopia without evil.
There's never enough time.
Huh?
Why did you lock the door, Light?
It's Sayu.
What is it?
Help me with my homework.
Okay, sure.
It's on quadratic equations.
I'm sorry if you were studying.
But... it just doesn't make any sense.
Please help me.
All right.
Light, be careful.
Any human who touches the notebook in your drawer... will be able to see me.
He waits to tell me that crucial detail now?
Damn Shinigami!
What's wrong, Light?
Hm?
It's nothing.
Well, what exactly don't you understand?
Well, umm...
I think everything.
From what we know, there have been 52 deaths just this past week.
They all had heart attacks.
They're all criminals who were wanted or being held in prison.
There are probably other criminals whose deaths are still unaccounted for.
Does that mean the death toll could easily be over a hundred?
Chief...we've already started.
I know.
I had a call from headquarters.
At any rate... they were all criminals who probably would have been executed.
Perhaps we shouldn't concern ourselves...
How stupid!
It doesn't matter if they're criminals or on death row.
Killing them is murder.
We aren't even sure that they were murdered.
There's no way over 100 people could have heart attacks at the same time!
It has got to be murder.
Is it even possible to kill that many people at the same time?
We believe that a large organization carefully orchestrated these killings.
If you say a large organization is involved,
I can't help but think that the fbi or ClA is involved.
I dare you to say that again!
Now, now.
Let's stop joking around.
We have to first clarify if these are murders, or strange coincidences.
But don't all the autopsy reports say that the deaths were caused by inexplicable heart attacks?
I don't see what else can be learned from just the way they died.
That's right!
It would be worth looking into if they were stabbed with knives!
If that's the case, we'll just have to have L solve this!
Chief, what is L?
This is your first time at this conference, isn't it?
No one knows L's name, location or what he looks like.
But he's managed to solve every case he's taken, no matter how difficult it is.
He's cracked many of the world's unsolved cases.
He's our trump card, the ace in the hole.
Our last hope.
Something like that.
But isn't L an arrogant individual who'll only take on cases he's interested in?
That's right.
We can't even contact him.
L is already involved.
L is already investigating this case.
Huh?
Watari?
Watari?
He's the only man who can contact L.
Furthermore, Watari's identity is also unknown...
Please be silent.
L will now speak.
Members of the lCPO...
I am L.
What are we doing sneaking around in such a desolate place, Light?
People who touch the Death Note can see you, can't they?
I can't just walk around with something this dangerous.
Up until now, I thought that if my family saw the notebook...
I could pass it off as a record of cases which I'm using to study to become a detective.
But I'm walking a fine line right now.
If I'm not careful,
I might end up killing... my own family.
This case is unprecedented in scope and difficulty because... it involves more people than any other case has before.
It is also an unforgivable crime of serial murder.
In order to solve this case,
I need the lCPO... no, various worldwide organizations, to cooperate fully.
I want you to decide whether you'll support me at this conference.
Also...
I strongly desire to work with the Japanese Police.
Huh?
W-Why Japan?
Regardless of how many suspects there are, there's a strong possibility they're Japanese.
Even if they aren't Japanese, they are hiding in Japan.
What grounds do you have for your claims?
Why Japan?
I think I can show you very soon by directly confronting the culprit.
A direct confrontation?
At any rate, I would like set up headquarters in Japan.
That was pretty easy to make...
Hmm?
Does that mean you were able to hide the notebook?
Yeah, in this drawer.
Does that count as a hiding place?
You left the key in the lock.
That's fine.
It's better that I intentionally left the key in a noticeable place.
It's just a regular diary...
Most people will probably be satisfied with the secrets of this drawer... after reading this diary.
But...
The real key... is this.
There's nothing suspicious about having one of these on my desk.
It's just a regular ballpoint pen.
I'll use the ink cartridge.
That's the key?
Yeah.
On the back of the drawer... there's a small hole that's hard to notice if you don't look closely.
You put this in the hole.
I see.
It's got a false bottom.
Well, you also have the fake diary, so I doubt anyone will find it.
That's not all.
Even if they discovered it has a false bottom, there would be no way that they could take the notebook.
You see...
This ink cartridge is an insulator so it doesn't channel electricity, and stops the flow of electricity in the circuit.
When the bottom of this drawer is closed, this piece of rubber also stops the flow of electricity.
However, if someone were to force open the bottom, gasoline in thin plastic bags will ignite at that moment and... the notebook will instantly be set aflame.
All evidence will be completely destroyed.
That's how it's set up.
I can just say the reason I burned it was that,
"l didn't want anyone to see my real diary."
It's a believable excuse.
It is a notebook, after all.
I've heard when a human gets a Death Note, the biggest problem they have is finding a good place to hide it.
But, Light, you're probably the first to go this far.
But that setup is really dangerous.
If you make even the slightest mistake, you could be badly burned.
Dangerous?
You're talking nonsense again, Ryuk.
I've been putting myself in danger from the very beginning.
Ever since I first got a hold of the Death Note.
Compared to that, this is hardly dangerous.
In fact, quite the opposite.
It protects me.
Which is better?
A small fire in the house, or being executed?
Last night, within the Tokyo West Penitentiary,
Naoki Kurotsukayama, aged thirty-two, who was detained for armed robbery... is reported to have died of a heart attack.
In response to the endless, bizarre deaths of prisoners...
That's amazing...
Bad guys just keep dying.
It's a little scary, but it does feel great.
But now, we really can't do anything bad.
I wonder if the police are behind it.
The police don't have that kind of power.
Don't you know about him?
Huh?
About who?
Kira...
Kira!
I wonder who's going to be killed next...
Kira, kill everyone.
Do you want to send this Message?
Send
Name:
Rococo Kira, kill everyone.
Name:
Misery Ryuk, take a look at this.
Hmm?
Someone's already created a website.
"The legend of Kira the savior."
That's pretty cool.
Is this about you?
Yeah.
"Kira" seems to come from the English word "killer."
I don't like that, but...
I've become "Kira" to the world.
Just searching the word "Kira," and countless sites like this one appear.
Television and newspapers have only publicized
Deepening Mystery Causes Controversy Mysterious Deaths in Prisons Continue Reconsidering the investigative System "the successive, mysterious deaths of vicious criminals."
But the people of the world can already feel it.
The existence of someone passing judgment.
Oh?
Ryuk, humans are like that.
For example, there's no way that anyone would bring up the topic of killing bad people in homeroom at school.
But if someone were to bring it up, everyone would act pious.
That's wrong.
That's what they're bound to say.
Of course, it's the right thing to say.
Humans must put up a front like that in public.
But their true feelings are there.
They may be afraid or not acknowledge my existence on the surface, but on the internet, where one can remain anonymous...
Kira is already thriving.
They don't talk about it, but they all understand.
Someone is making the bad guys disappear.
Those who have a clean conscience are cheering for Kira in their hearts...
And those who have done wrong fear that heaven's judgment will strike upon them.
It's perfect.
Everything is going exactly as planned.
Notice The Scheduled Program will be interrupted for a Special Broadcast
We interrupt this program to bring you a special, worldwide broadcast from the lCPO, lnterpol.
Hmm?
What's this?
Interpol?
We'll start now.
I am Lind L. Tailor the sole person able to mobilize the world's police.
Also known as L.
W-Who is this?
It's finally started.
He's never shown his face, right?
So why now?
It means that L is serious.
All right, L...
We're doing exactly what you told us to do.
Now, let's see you prove what you said at the lCPO conference.
There has been a string of serial killings targeting criminals.
This is the most atrocious act of murder in history and it will not go unpunished.
I will definitely catch the one behind the murders, commonly known as "Kira. "
He said he'll definitely catch you.
The fool.
There's no way he can catch me.
This is the Death Note!
If you don't have this, there's no evidence.
There's no way you can catch me.
I knew that the police would start investigating and that someone like you would turn up.
Kira, I have a pretty good idea behind your motive and why you're doing this.
But what you're doing is...
Evil!
I'm evil?
I am justice!
I'm saving the week, who fear evil.
I'm the man who will become... the god of the ideal, new world!
All those who oppose that god...
they are evil!
L, you're too stupid.
This could've been more interesting if you'd been a bit smarter...
The entire world is watching to see what happens if anyone defies me...
L.
Just five more seconds...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One...
What's wrong?
Why don't you say something?
U-Unbelievable.
I had to check to be sure.
Who would have thought you could have done this?
Kira, it seems you can kill people without direct contact.
I couldn't believe it before seeing it with my own eyes.
Listen to me, Kira.
If you just killed the man on-screen, Lind L. Tailor, you just killed a man who was scheduled to be executed today.
It wasn't me.
What?
!
This criminal is someone who the police caught secretly.
His capture wasn't broadcast on television or the internet.
It seems that even you couldn't get information on him.
He got you.
But I, L... do exist!
So come on!
Try and kill me!
Why that...!
- What's wrong?
Do it quickly!
- What's going on?
!
This is unreal!
- C'mon!
Kill me!
- Are you trying to die, L?
!
- What's going on?
- It's Kira versus L!
It's a live murder!
- Come on, Kira!
- This is scary!
Try and kill me!
What's the matter?
Can't you do it?
!
It seems that you can't kill me.
So, there are some people that you can't kill.
You've given me a good clue.
I'll tell you something good in return.
I told you that this is a live broadcast worldwide, but...
This is only being broadcast in the Kanto region of Japan.
I was planning on broadcasting this in different areas at different times, but it seems that I no longer need to.
Now I know that you are based in the Kanto region.
This L guy is pretty good.
The first victim was the killer in Shinjuku.
The police overlooked this case because it was so minor.
Of all the criminals who died of heart attacks,
Kurou Otoharada Unemployed Shinjuku Phantom Killer this one's crime was the least serious.
Furthermore, his crime was
Kurou Otoharada only broadcast in Japan.
I have been able to deduce this much.
You are in Japan and your first victim was your guinea pig.
You're just lucky that you're in Kanto, the most heavily populated region in Japan.
I never thought that things would go quite so well, but...
Kira, it won't be too long before I can sentence you to death.
L certainly lives up to his reputation...
Yes, he's proved that Kira exists, that the killings took place, and that Kira's in Japan.
Kira, I'm interested how you commit the murders.
But...
I'll find that out when I catch you.
Until we meet again...
Kira...
He's going to... sentence me to death?
Interesting.
I'll accept your challenge.
They both have to hunt down each other, but neither of them know each other's name or face.
And the first one who gets found is dead!
Humans sure are interesting!
L...!
Kira...
- I will definitely find and finish you!
- I will definitely find and finish you!
I am...
I am...
- justice!
- justice!
I dreamed a dream that no one could see,
I threw away everything that I didn't need
I'm holding these feelings that I can't give up in my heart
Even if my feet fall victim to the shackles of sacrifice
In between reality and my ideal
I can't hold back the flooding impulses
Because I have a strong desire to accomplish [deceit] [fear] [vanity] [melancholy]
I'm not weak enough to believe any of these negative perceptions
I'm a trickster who doesn't know solitude
I'm not the one who's going to find L.
The police will track him down...
Serial Murder Special Investigation Headquarters And I will eliminate him.
Looks like I may be able to provide you a little more entertainment, Ryuk.
Within the spreading darkness

It's just a regular diary...
Most people will probably be satisfied with the secrets of this drawer... after reading this diary.
But...
The real key... is this.
There's nothing suspicious about having one of these on my desk.
It's just a regular ballpoint pen.
I'll use the ink cartridge.
That's the key?
Yeah.
On the back of the drawer... there's a small hole that's hard to notice if you don't look closely.
You put this in the hole.
I see.
It's got a false bottom.
so I doubt anyone will find it.
That's not all. there would be no way that they could take the notebook.
You see... and stops the flow of electricity in the circuit. this piece of rubber also stops the flow of electricity. gasoline in thin plastic bags will ignite at that moment and... the notebook will instantly be set aflame.
All evidence will be completely destroyed.
That's how it's set up.
l didn't want anyone to see my real diary.
It's a believable excuse.
after all. the biggest problem they have is finding a good place to hide it.
you're probably the first to go this far.
But that setup is really dangerous. you could be badly burned.
Ryuk.
I've been putting myself in danger from the very beginning.
Ever since I first got a hold of the Death Note.
this is hardly dangerous.
quite the opposite.
It protects me.
Which is better?
or being executed? who was detained for armed robbery... is reported to have died of a heart attack.
bizarre deaths of prisoners...
That's amazing...
Bad guys just keep dying.
but it does feel great.
we really can't do anything bad.
I wonder if the police are behind it.
The police don't have that kind of power.
Don't you know about him?
Huh?
About who?

Kira!

there's no way that anyone would bring up the topic of killing bad people in homeroom at school.

So why now?
It means that L is serious.
L...
We're doing exactly what you told us to do.
let's see you prove what you said at the ICPO conference.
There has been a string of serial killings targeting criminals.
This is the most atrocious act of murder in history and it will not go unpunished. commonly known as "Kira.
He said he'll definitely catch you.
The fool.
There's no way he can catch me.
This is the Death Note!
there's no evidence.
There's no way you can catch me.
I knew that the police would start investigating and that someone like you would turn up.
I have a pretty good idea behind your motive and why you're doing this.
But what you're doing is...
Evil!
I'm evil?
I am justice!
who fear evil.
I'm the man who will become... new world!
All those who oppose that god...
they are evil!
you're too stupid.
This could've been more interesting if you'd been a bit smarter...

Why don't you say something?
U-Unbelievable.
I had to check to be sure.
Who would have thought you could have done this?
it seems you can kill people without direct contact.
I couldn't believe it before seeing it with my own eyes.
Kira. you just killed a man who was scheduled to be executed today.
It wasn't me.
What?
!
This criminal is someone who the police caught secretly.
His capture wasn't broadcast on television or the internet.
It seems that even you couldn't get information on him.
He got you.

So come on!
Try and kill me!
Why that...!

Do it quickly!

Can't you do it?

It seems that you can't kill me.
there are some people that you can't kill.
You've given me a good clue.
I'll tell you something good in return.
but...
This is only being broadcast in the Kanto region of Japan. but it seems that I no longer need to.
Now I know that you are based in the Kanto region.
This L guy is pretty good.
The first victim was the killer in Shinjuku.

L certainly lives up to his reputation... and that Kira's in Japan.
I'm interested how you commit the murders.

I'll find that out when I catch you.

The Death Note is real!
Don't think for a moment, that any human who's used the Death Note can go to Heaven or Hell.
I want the world to know...

And that there's someone who is passing judgment onto them!
And I will become... the god of this new world!
CONFRONTATION
I had no idea what he was thinking, so I'm done with him.
Really?
Then how was it with that other older guy?
Mr. Yagami.
Please translate the sentence into Japanese.
Yes.
"When finally, he fully succeeded in making his dream a reality, he was immersed in beatitude. "
Very good.
As usual, a perfect answer.
Well then, class is dismissed.
â€ It's finally over.
â€ Where do you want to go after?
â€ School sure is boring.
â€ Hmm, where should we go?
Hey, Light!
Light, are you listening to me?
Don't talk to me.
Others can hear my voice when I talk, unlike yours.
You're so boring.
Hey, Light!
We're going to go...
Sorry, I have something to do.
You don't have anything to do.
Aren't you just going home like you usually do?
What are you talking about?
I have something to do.
Something very important.
Yamada is suspected of stabbing a fellow employee in the abdomen at a restaurant in Kabukicho, Shinjuku, yesterday.
The knife was from the restaurant and was roughly twelve inches long.
- Hey!
- The suspect said...
- Hey, Light!
- "he was being rude, so I just lost it. "
What is it?
You're really working very hard.
I can't waste any time.
I only have a limited amount of time to write names in the notebook...
The only time I have is when I get home from school and until I go to bed.
I also need to maintain my grades.
I can't sleep during class.
I need to do all of my homework for school and my prep classes.
Lack of sleep is dangerous.
It will affect my health and concentration.
After all, I'm trying to change this world into a utopia without evil.
There's never enough time.
Why did you lock the door, Light?
It's Sayu.
What is it?
Help me with my homework.
Okay, sure.
It's on quadratic equations!
I'm sorry if you were studying.
But it just doesn't make any sense.
Please help me.
All right.
Light, be careful.
Any human who touches the notebook in your drawer... will be able to see me.
He waits to tell me that crucial detail now?
Damn Shinigami!
What's wrong, Light?
It's nothing.
Well, what exactly don't you understand?
Well, umm...
I think everything.
From what we know, there have been 52 deaths just this past week.
All from heart attacks.
They're all criminals who were wanted or being held in prison.
There are probably other criminals whose deaths are still unaccounted for.
Does that mean the death toll could easily be over a hundred?
Chief... we've already started!
I know.
I had a call from headquarters.
At any rate... they were all criminals who probably would have been executed.
Perhaps we shouldn't concern ourselves...
Are you stupid?
!
It doesn't matter if they're criminals or on death row.
Killing them is still murder.
We aren't even sure that they were murdered.
How can over 100 people have heart attacks at the same time?
!
It has got to be murder.
Is it even possible to kill that many people at the same time?
We believe that a large organization carefully orchestrated these killings.
If you say a large organization is involved,
I can't help but think that the FBI or CIA is involved.
I dare you to say that again!
Now, now.
Let's stop joking around.
We have to first clarify if these are murders, or strange coincidences.
But don't all the autopsy reports say that the deaths were caused by inexplicable heart attacks?
I don't see what else can be learned from just the way they died.
That's right!
It would be worth looking into if they were stabbed with knives!
If that's the case, we'll just have to have L solve this!
What do you think?
Chief, what is "L"?
This is your first time at this conference, isn't it?
No one knows L's name, location or what he looks like.
But he's managed to solve every case he's taken, no matter how difficult it is.
He's cracked many of the world's unsolved cases.
He's our trump card, our secret weapon.
Our last hope.
Something like that.
But isn't L so arrogant that he only takes cases that interest him?
That's right.
We can't even contact him.
L is already involved.
L is already investigating this case.
Huh?
Watari?
Watari?
He's the only man who can contact L.
Furthermore, Watari's identity is also unknown...
Please be silent.
L will now speak.
Members of the ICPO... lam L.
What are we doing sneaking around such a desolate place, Light?
People who touch the Death Note can see you, can't they?
I can't walk around with something this dangerous.
Up until now, I thought that if my family saw the notebook...
I could pass it off as a record of cases which I'm using to study to become a detective.
But I'm walking a fine line right now.
If I'm not careful,
I might end up killing... my own family.
This case is unprecedented in scope and difficulty.
It involves more people than any other case preceding it.
It is also an unforgivable case of serial murder.
In order to solve this case, I need the ICPO... no, various worldwide organizations, to cooperate fully.
I want you to decide whether you'll support me at this conference.
Also...
I strongly desire to work with the Japanese Police.
W
- Why Japan?
Regardless of how many suspects there are, there's a strong possibility that they are Japanese.
Even if they aren't Japanese, they are hiding in Japan.
What grounds do you have for your claims?
Why Japan?
I think I can show you very soon by directly confronting the perpetrator.
A direct confrontation?
At any rate, I would like set up headquarters in Japan.
That was pretty easy to make...
Hmm?
Does that mean you were able to hide the notebook?
Yeah, in this drawer.
Does that count as a hiding place?
You left the key in the lock.
That's fine.
It's better that I intentionally left the key in a noticeable place.
That's just a regular diary!
Most people will probably be satisfied with the secrets of this drawer... after reading this diary.
But...
The real key... is this.
There's nothing suspicious about having one of these on my desk.
It's just a regular ballpoint pen.
I'll use the ink cartridge.
That's the key?
Yeah.
On the back of the drawer... there's a small hole that's hard to notice if you don't look closely.
You put this in the hole.
I see.
It's got a false bottom.
Well, you also have the fake diary, so I doubt anyone will find it.
That's not all.
Even if they discovered it has a false bottom, there would be no way that they could take the notebook.
You see...
This ink cartridge is an insulator so it doesn't channel electricity, and stops the flow of electricity in the circuit.
When the bottom of this drawer is closed, this piece of rubber also stops the flow of electricity.
However, if someone were to force open the bottom, gasoline in thin plastic bags will ignite at that moment and... the notebook will instantly be set aflame.
All evidence will be completely destroyed.
That's how it's set up.
I can just say the reason I set it up to burn was that,
"| didn't want anyone to see my real diary. "
It's a believable excuse.
It is a notebook, after all.
I've heard when a human gets a Death Note, the biggest problem they have is finding a good place to hide it.
But Light, you're probably the first to go this far.
But that setup is really dangerous.
If you make the slightest mistake, you could be badly burned.
Dangerous?
You're talking nonsense again, Ryuk.
I've been putting myself in danger from the very beginning.
Ever since I first got a hold of the Death Note.
Compared to that, this is hardly dangerous.
In fact, quite the opposite.
It protects me.
Which is better?
A small fire in the house, or being executed?
Last night, within the Tokyo West Penitentiary,
Naoki Kurotsukayama, aged thirty-two, who was being detained for armed robbery... is reported to have died of a heart attack.
In response to the endless, bizarre deaths of prisoners...
That's amazing...
Bad guys just keep dying.
It's a little scary, but it does feel great.
But we really can't do anything bad now.
I wonder if the police are behind it.
The police don't have that kind of power.
Don't you know about him?
Huh?
About who?
It's Kira...
Kira!
I wonder who's going to be killed next...

Of course, it's the right thing to say.

Who would have thought you could have done this?
Kira, it seems you can kill people without direct contact.
I couldn't believe it before seeing it with my own eyes.
Listen to me, Kira.
If you just killed the man on-screen, Lind L. Tailor, you just killed a man who was scheduled to be executed today.
That wasn't me.
What?
!
This criminal is someone who the police caught secretly.
His capture wasn't broadcast on television or the internet.
It seems that even you couldn't get information on him.

It seems that you can't kill me.
So, there are some people that you can't kill.
You've given me a good clue.
I'll tell you something good in return.
I told you that this is a live broadcast worldwide, but...
This is only being broadcast in the Kanto region of Japan.
I was planning on broadcasting this in different areas at different times, but it seems that I no longer need to.
I now know that you are based in the Kanto region.
This L guy is pretty good.
The first victim was the perpetrator of the random murders in Shinjuku.
The police overlooked this case because it was so minor.
Of all the criminals who died of heart attacks, this one's crime was the least serious.
only broadcast in Japan.
I have been able to deduce this much.
You are in Japan and your first victim was your guinea pig.
You're just lucky that you're in Kanto, the most heavily populated region in Japan.
I never thought that things would go quite so well, but...
Kira, it probably won't be too long before I can sentence you to death.
L certainly lives up to his reputation...
Yes, he's proved that Kira exists, that the killings took place, and that Kira's in Japan.
Kira, I'm interested how you commit the murders.
But...
I'll find that out when I catch you.
Until we meet again...
Kira...
He's going to... sentence me to death?
Interesting.
I'll accept your challenge.
They both have to hunt each other down... but neither of them know each other's name or what they look like.
And the first one who's discovered, dies!

DEALINGS
Torchwood.
Outside the government, beyond the police.
Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future.
The 21st century is when everything changes.
And you've gotta be ready.
Nearly there.
We've been right busy since you lot were billeted here.
This your first time?
The others been teasing you?
That it?
My name's Mary.
Mary, like the Virgin.
Religious man, are you?
I'm not your bloody hound.
Whore!
Do whores have prayers?
Once, just once,
I'd like to walk into one of these tents and find it's a party.
You know, with food and drink, people dancing, a girl crying in the corner.
- Is it alien?
- And how.
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite, pyroxene and even Dark Matter.
- Any idea what it is?
- Not a clue.
Could be a weapon or a really big stapler.
How's our friend there?
- She's dead.
- Yeah, thanks, Quincy. "She"?
- Judging by the size of her skull.
- How long have they been here, Tosh?
From the depth they found them, 196 years, 11 to 11 -and-a-half months.
The Earth's been disturbed, so I'm afraid I can't be more accurate.
What killed her?
The stapler?
No.
See those shattered ribs?
I reckon she was shot.
- Well, let's get her back to the Hub and find out.
- Yep.
Need a hand?
- Oh, you're so light!
You're like a girl.
- I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.
But I guess I don't need to tell you that.
I'm really sorry.
I think your computer might be dead.
You're kidding.
What happened?
Okay, so she said I was no good at sport.
Hello?
So I said, "Well, throw something to me and..."
- What happened to the computer?
- Oh, I kicked out the plug.
What?
I was running a translation program I'd written.
I'd collated every scrap of alien language we've got and broken it down into binary threads to see if there was a common derivation.
That's a bit of a mouthful.
Sorry.
Private joke...
Erm, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.
We've got a job to do.
She's right.
You're right, Tosh.
I'm sorry.
Do you know what, Tosh?
Sometimes I think even that stick up your arse has got a stick up its arse.
So the guy over there's been staring at me all evening, and I've told him he's wasting his time, but he won't listen.
So I've come over to talk to you because I know how this ends.
He gets a punch in the neck and I get barred.
And I've already been barred from about 20 pubs, and I don't want to get barred from this one because they do these nice olives on the tables.
- Er... right.
Okay, then.
- Cool.
Let me get you a drink.
- Really, there's no need.
- JD and Coke.
And, Toshiko, what do you want?
- I didn't tell you my name.
- Oh, yeah.
That was the other thing.
- I kind of know who you are.
- I think you're mistaken...
Toshiko Sato.
Born in London, 1975, moved to Osaka when you were two, then back to the UK in 1986.
Parents in the RAF, grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.
Very impressive.
University, blah, blah.
Snapped up to government science think tank when you were 20.
Recruited to Torchwood three years ago.
I saw you at the building site this morning.
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?
There's stuff on the Internet, but you have to dig really deep.
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from police radio scanners.
We also...
- "We"?
- Scavengers.
Collectors, just like you.
How many of there are you?
Listen, don't think it's in any way organized.
It's really just a disparate bunch of IT guys who live with their mothers.
I shouldn't talk to you.
So go.
What's most amazing are the similarities with our own culture.
But that can be horrible, 'cause we find lots of weapons and it just makes you think, "My God, everything wages war.
"It's not just a trait of ours, but a trait of existence."
And it makes you feel so hopeless.
But then there are times...
We found this thing.
It was about A4 size and it had all these symbols on it, and it took me about three months to translate.
And it was a letter someone had written to his family, to his children, to say how much he was missing them.
It just made me cry, because I thought, even across these unimaginable distances, there are fundamentals that stay exactly the same.
And there's no one to talk to about this.
I mean, the guys at work, they're great, but they don't see it the way I do.
I could be fired just for telling you that.
I want to show you something.
It's a pendant.
Put it on.
I'll drink one more and just drive slowly.
Does coffee count as food if you've got sugar in it?
If he tugs his groin one more time, I'm gonna smack him in the face.
I should have said it was Hammer time when she asked what the time was earlier.
That would have made them all laugh.
What are they?
I can hear voices.
Bloody Sudoku.
So bloody smug.
Did I send that e-mail?
Did I click the "Reply to All"?
They're people's thoughts.
- He doesn't touch me any more.
- What?
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.
I wish I'd shagged that single dad I met at the parents' evening.
What's that Asian girl doing?
Is she having a fit or something?
If I move slightly to the left...
It's...
They're so loud.
She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?
Marcus Farrell reckons he's done it with two lesbians, lucky sod.
How would it work?
That man over there with...
I can hear him.
I mean, does one of them sort of sit on...
Okay, Toshiko, I need you to focus.
- I can hear all of them.
- No way I'm showing that to a doctor.
Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out.
- It's so...
- Just me.
There's no one else but me.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?
Okay, I want you to home in on just my thoughts.
Ignore everything else.
- There's just so much...
- You can do it.
It takes practice, but this is what you have to learn.
Now, what am I thinking?
- This is so hard.
- Follow my voice.
What am I thinking?
- You're thinking...
- That I want to kiss you.
- I..
I'm sorry.
That was...
- No, look, it's...
- Sometimes you can't control...
- I know.
It's fine.
- Where did you get it?
- It's been in the family a long time.
- I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
- It's more than incredible.
With this, you can read people's minds.
It levels the pitch between man and God.
- Is it alien?
- I guess.
No, I want you to keep it.
- What?
I can't, Mary.
- Please.
I've kept it too long.
After a while it gets...
You hear too much.
It changes how you see people.
I'll have to show it to the others.
What?
Nothing.
Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding my CV on the Internet?
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.
Because I will.
Yeah?
But you won't.
- Good morning.
- Yeah, hi, Ianto.
What the hell would produce such a perfect circular puncture?
Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.
She better not go into one about the computer again.
Morning.
Sergeant Giving-It-All. "Oh, Gwennie has deigned to call her old mates."
Should put a Weevil in his bathroom.
- I've got something to show you.
- Sure.
Please don't make us sit through another slide show about the Incas or whatever it was.
- I want a biscuit.
- Have I got time for a pee first?
Oh, sweetheart, the jeans-in-the-boots thing has really kind of had its day.
I...
I found this thing.
What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.
Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet.
Okay, I don't know if this comes under actual technology...
I can smell Owen.
I can smell him on me after that shag in his car this morning.
That's twice now.
Does that make it an arrangement?
No, it has to be more than two times, surely.
Long as we keep it to just the two times, we're fine.
What's Tosh looking at?
You okay, Tosh?
When she did that thing when she ran her tongue across my teeth...
I should have worn different jeans.
I'm gonna have to sit down till this subsides a bit.
- Yeah.
No, fine.
- So what is it you want to show us?
I wonder if I could get Owen to come down to the vault.
No, couldn't have sex in front of a Weevil.
I couldn't even do it in front of Trevor Kendall's cat.
Forget it.
It's...
I found this article.
I'll bring it in tomorrow.
No worries.
But thanks for that rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh.
I can't imagine a time when this isn't everything.
The pain's so constant, like my stomach's full of rats.
Feels like this is all I am now.
There isn't an inch of me that doesn't hurt.
I'm about to brew some of Jack's industrial-strength coffee.
- Would you like a cup?
- I'm...
I'm fine.
Thanks, Ianto.
Might have known you'd have my address as well.
- Did you tell them?
- No, I didn't.
What made you change your mind?
You listened to them, didn't you?
See, I told you.
Isn't it incredible?
Some of the stuff you hear!
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?
- I told you.
- The things I heard.
What they thought of me, what they really thought.
God, these are people that are supposed to like me.
They do like you.
People are complicated.
They...
Okay, I should have warned you about this.
It isn't like reading someone's diary.
The stuff you've been hearing, it's so deep, so personal, stuff they're not even aware they're thinking.
You think you know someone, then suddenly you see them for real and they're bastard, little kids!
Not everything.
Not everyone.
I wouldn't say your thoughts were exactly pure.
At least they're consistent.
No agenda.
No resentment.
They pity me.
- You don't pity me.
- Why would I?
- What you're thinking now, that's pretty graphic.
- That wasn't my thought.
- What?
- I wasn't thinking anything.
That wasn't my thought.
Must have been yours.
- That one.
There.
That's yours.
- Yeah, that was mine.
I certainly seem to be enjoying myself.
You would.
You will.
You have no ashtrays in your whole house, not one.
What are you using?
- I think it's an egg cup.
- I see.
You okay?
Freaking out a little?
- Your birthday's July, right?
- You're the expert.
- Isn't it a little late to still have your cards up?
- What?
" Lots of love, Owen."
I'm guessing that's Owen from work, Owen from the building site yesterday morning,
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
- Put that down.
- All I'm saying is,
- I don't want to get in the way of anything.
- There's nothing to get in the way of.
I see.
- You want to talk about it?
- Not really.
It's okay.
Wouldn't be the first time I'd been a rebound shag.
You weren't, okay?
Nothing's happened.
Nothing will ever happen.
One of the delightful things I found out, thanks to your bloody pendant.
It's not all bad, the pendant.
Some of the things it can do are extraordinary.
What good could ever come of that?
You need to work that out for yourself.
You need to go somewhere public, somewhere crowded.
What am I looking for?
It will find you.
I'm sick of these riddles.
What's going on?
- Where did you get this?
- I told you.
Who are you, Mary?
- Is that even your real name?
- Okay.
Here's another name.
Philoctetes.
I'm Philoctetes.
Could bandage my hand, say I shut it in a car door.
That would explain why the signatures don't match.
Gives me an hour before Lisa gets back to dress up.
I've got to be careful.
She's starting to notice her tights getting baggy around the crotch.
All big-eyed and giggly, and I'm sat there with my boobs like something out of the National Geographic.
Six cigarettes today and all of them post-coital.
Glorious.
"Ah, Mr Bond, we've been expecting you.
We expect you to die."
Some people should actually be prohibited from wearing a thong.
What's that girl looking at?
Reckons "just gay enough" is the new black.
I'm gonna kill them.
I'm gonna kill them.
I'm gonna kill them.
I'm gonna kill them, lay their bodies out afterwards and lie next to them.
So I'll have to do myself lying down.
I should have practiced that.
Sorry.
I wear my glasses 'cause it makes me look more sensitive.
If Lawrence comes in and finds us, he'll know that this is what's right and what he's been doing is trespassing.
I'll tell him it's not a love bite.
Something fell on my neck.
Couldn't switch to another therapist.
We'd spend a year just doing the catch-up.
I won't miss anything.
I won't miss this city, I won't miss this body, I won't miss anything.
- Go.
Go and open the door.
- He's here.
All right, Danny?
I want him back at 6:00, and I mean 6:00 this time.
Kelly's given me 90 minutes after-hours at the tanning salon as a wedding present.
Besides, you're breaking the law, bringing him home late.
My dad reckons I can have you arrested, so think on.
Hey, put your shoes on and go to the toilet.
What's that face?
- I don't wanna go.
- Well, you have to.
Lawrence will be here in a minute and we're looking at napkins.
- It's boring.
- Well, take your Space Invaders.
Lawrence bought him that.
Don't hear a peep out of him now.
Mind, that's Lawrence all over, dead thoughtful.
Not like some.
Oh, and no cola.
I don't want him coming home here all excited.
- I thought you'd stopped going fishing.
- I have.
Oh, my God, Neil, what are you doing?
I was thinking of the Isle of Wight.
You remember?
We had that chalet, around when Danny was walking, and the chalet was just full of spiders,
and you called me your hero because I wasn't scared.
I would just pick them up and throw them out.
Oh, my God, Neil!
No, you're scaring me.
It was this perfect little memory.
We were happy because we were together.
And all this nonsense with Lawrence, it's fine.
I forgive you.
'Cause I'm looking at the bigger picture now.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Christ!
No, no!
Don't, please.
It's okay.
It's just like falling asleep, really.
Oh, no.
Don't do this to Danny, please!
Then we will be together forever.
It's okay.
You're okay now.
Plodders.
♪ The leg bone's connected to the hip bone
Stop singing.
Please stop singing.
♪ The hip bone's connected to the something bone ♪
Anything to stop you singing.
Don't know what you're laughing at.
Stop singing.
Please don't sing.
Please don't sing.
Not listening.
Right.
Okay.
What's going on?
You know the skeleton we found at the building site?
Well, Amanda Burton here has just completed the postmortem.
- Okay, I can explain.
- As you may remember, at the building site,
Owen said this was a woman killed by a single gunshot.
Yeah, I'd been there, like, a minute.
Since then, he's had to "tweak" some of his initial conclusions, the first being that this isn't in fact a woman, but a man.
A young man.
A very girly man.
But still, ultimately, a man.
Then there was the cause of death.
Owen said GSW.
- The correct answer was...
- Unidentified trauma, but...
Unidentified trauma?
You see it in RTAs when something like a steering column or a post goes into a body at great velocity.
But the one thing that could be ruled out was...
- Gunshot wound.
- Gunshot wound.
Was there, in fact, any part of your prognosis that was right?
I got that it was a skeleton.
- Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.
- You've just passed the point of no return now.
- Where did you train?
Did you train?
- I trained at...
Look.
Absolutely useless.
Jack, do you know anything about Greek mythology?
Security visa 45895.
Harkness.
A little, why?
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.
- You went to a pub quiz?
- Yeah.
No, I love pub quizzes.
Down at the Prince of...
Tides.
Philoctetes was an archer recruited to fight in the Trojan War.
He got in an argument and was marooned on the island of Lemnos for about 10 years.
Just left there?
Hey, what's happening with that list for UNIT?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I'm still working on it.
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready.
Prime Minister, is this a secure line?
Can you tell me why Torchwood operations have become part of your security briefings to the Leader of the Opposition?
The deal is...
No.
This is incredible.
This is the most incredible thing I ever heard.
- They should make an action figure of you.
- You were right about the pendant.
I see it now.
It can be used for good.
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?
- I didn't tell them.
- I think that's wise.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kiss you now.
- Mary, no.
- Listen.
You do something unbelievably brave and sexy, I have to kiss you.
I don't make the rules.
So, what's happening with the thing you found on the building site?
Don't know.
My boss is dealing with that.
I thought you did all the technological stuff.
I do, but sometimes our jobs overlap a bit.
I'm doing...
There's an admin thing he's asked me to do.
Don't you have a secretary for that?
It's actually quite complicated.
- So what's he found out?
- I don't know.
He's not said anything.
- Hmm.
That's kind of strange.
- It isn't.
It's fine.
No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from you, there's bound to be a reason.
You're not still worrying about that, are you?
Okay, so I'm thinking if it isn't a gunshot or a musket shot or whatever they had then, maybe it's some kind of ritual.
You are gorgeous.
So I started looking into devil worship and stuff from that era to see if there's anything about plucking out hearts, and would you believe it?
There's nothing.
They ate eyeballs, they drank blood, they had sex with animals, but they did not pluck out each other's hearts, 'cause, obviously, that would have been weird.
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat to society any more.
Yeah, I know, it's just...
There's something...
- Does that remind you of anything?
- Erm...
That bit in Alien where that thing bursts out of John Hurt?
I'm sorry, I should have been more specific.
Does that remind you of anything helpful?
- No, sorry.
- Right.
Just go over there, do your computer stuff and think about shoes, eh?
Thank you.
Has Jack said anything to you about the hardware we found with the skeleton?
No, why?
Check if there were any hospitals nearby.
Could have been someone died in an operation.
This has got sugar in it.
No worries.
Just asking.
Hello.
Keep looking at the skeleton.
Don't look at her.
You're grinning.
Stop grinning.
Hey, Tosh.
That coffee going begging?
What's the matter with him?
Why isn't he looking at me?
There's copies of that Michael Hamilton statement on your desk.
He's still seeing Cybermen outside his mother's house.
Don't think about her palm on the bottom of my spine, her hand in my hair.
- I think I'll just go over there.
- Okay.
I'll phone Social Services, see if there's a history of mental illness.
No, Gwen, this is good.
It can't go on.
This is a good thing.
Why the hell isn't he looking at me?
I think my desk is on fire.
So I've just come from a really interesting conversation
- with a Detective Inspector Henderson.
- Right.
Interesting because, firstly, the man had the biggest hands I've ever seen, and secondly, because of the story he told me about you saving a woman and her kid from being murdered by her ex-husband.
- Yeah.
No, I was going to tell you about that.
- So why didn't you?
I don't know.
It wasn't a work thing, just a thing thing.
Stuff happens all the time that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?
So you secretly fight crime, is that it, Tosh?
I didn't want it to look like I was showing off.
The guy they arrested, Henderson said, you heard him muttering to himself as he was walking along, and that's what tipped you off.
Mmm-hmm.
Couldn't really work out what he was saying at first, and then I was like, "Jesus!"
That's weird, 'cause when I'm about to murder someone,
I'm really careful not to talk to myself about it while I'm in the street.
No, sure.
I mean, that's lesson one.
I was wondering how you were getting on with this.
It's ongoing.
- Gonna dismantle it?
- Like I said, it's ongoing.
What?
Have I got something on my face?
Is it food?
No, sorry, I zoned out.
Well, listen, that was a good save, Tosh.
Well done.
Okay, so I've got crisps, I've got coffee, real coffee, wine...
I'm giving them the pendant.
- Right, let's...
- You're right.
It's not like reading someone's diary.
It's so much worse, and it makes me feel dirty and ashamed,
- and now I've been spying on my friends.
- Some friends.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- They pity you.
They exclude you.
They've got you doing bloody admin.
So?
- No.
I've made up my mind.
- Toshiko, don't do this.
So they'll probably want to talk to you.
Why do you care?
It's the pendant they're interested in.
They don't care about you.
I go in that place, I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come...
Put the phone down!
Okay, I'll show you.
This is why you can't tell them.
You're cold.
- Who are you?
- Still the person you kissed.
The person you caressed.
Say something.
So I'm shagging a woman and an alien.
Which is worse?
Well, I know which one my parents would say.
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be anything bigger than this?
The freedom you have...
When I first got here, I found it almost obscene.
My world was savage.
Enforced worship in temples the size of cities, execution squads roaming the streets.
Dissent of any kind meant death or transportation to what they'd call a feral outpost.
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.
It's how we've communicated for centuries.
Speaking orally, using a prearranged and finite number of words, it's so archaic.
And kind of gross to look at.
The machine you found is a transporter.
It brought me here, it can get me home again.
- I need it back before you dismantle it.
- Won't you be in danger?
Two hundred years have passed.
There'll be a new government.
There'll have been 20 new governments by now.
Then why hasn't someone come back for you?
I've been forgotten, like Philoctetes on Lemnos.
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you, fix the transporter, get you back home.
You won't.
You'll examine me, assess whether or not I'm useful, whether I'm a danger, then lock me in a cell.
You're not interested in understanding alien cultures.
It's just as well you haven't got the technology to reach other planets yet.
Yours is a culture of invasion.
Do you really think I'm going to walk, hands raised in surrender, into that?
Silence when the door opens.
Can't do another night of this silence.
His hands were cold.
Giving it all.
"We're calling Social Services,"
just over a couple of bruises.
Worst-case scenario, she lives to be really old and the whole inheritance goes on sheltered accommodation.
Calling it "Granddad's little secret".
I can't stand it any more, the weight of it.
The depravity.
The fear.
It fills me up.
It's in my mouth and my hair and my eyes.
Marmer?
Like I'm drowning in ink.
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
" Heart removed.
Records and postmortem passed to Operation Lowry."
Operation Lowry.
And even when I don't have the pendant on, even when there's nothing,
I can't forget the things I've seen, the things I've heard.
" Heart removed.
" Heart removed.
Removed."
How far back does it go?
It's like a curse, something the gods sent to drive someone mad.
I had hope I'd see something, some little random act of kindness to make me think we were safe, there was some essential good in us.
This is impossible.
But there isn't.
It's like one of the Weevils.
Look inside, it's just this great yawning scream.
This is completely impossible.
You were right.
Everything you said about us.
We're frightened and we're callous.
- Owen.
- You need to see this.
And I can't be part of it any longer.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do.
Get me into Torchwood.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man
" Down to a sunless sea"
So where is it, lover?
Stay here.
Jack, my boss, has got it.
Be quick.
I've a long journey ahead of me.
I might need something to eat before I go.
This what you're looking for?
- Jack.
- Friend of mine...
Let's call him Vincent.
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend, likes his sport, likes a beer.
Starts acting a little strange, a little distracted.
Suddenly, he disappears for a couple of months.
He comes back and we've gotta start calling him Vanessa.
Since then, I've always been a little nervous when a friend behaves out of character.
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.
Jack Harkness.
My guess is you're not from around these parts.
Now, this...
This is incredible.
- You know what it is?
- It's a transporter.
Mary was a political prisoner.
She was exiled here.
- Look, Jack...
- You got half of it right.
Mary...
It is Mary, isn't it?
You want to tell her the really interesting bit?
No?
Chatty, isn't she?
I don't know how you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.
It's a two-man transporter, or whatever you people may be.
You might be squids, for all I know.
A two-squid transporter.
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what happened to the guard, Mary?
I killed him.
But I was disturbed.
Then another came, a soldier.
He tried to shoot me.
Do whores have prayers?
So I plunged my new human hand into his chest and plucked out his heart.
- And that's what you've been doing ever since.
- This form needs to be fed.
All the punctures were all about the size of a fist.
My God, all those people.
You killed all those people.
I fled before any more soldiers came.
I had so much to explore.
And how I love this body.
So soft.
So wicked.
The power such a body has in this world.
Within a few years, the forest had gone, transporter was safely buried under the spread of the city.
I didn't care.
I wasn't exactly in a hurry to get home.
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when my situation here became complicated, but I was safe as long as I knew where the transporter was.
The way she looks at you with those eyes.
She's like an animal.
When they brought that girl into the hospital,
I'd only been qualified six months.
I wanted to throw up.
And then the machine was uncovered.
As soon as the air touched its surface, I could feel it.
She's just talking.
She's not even frightened of us.
She's just talking.
Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.
- Gonna go for it now.
- Owen, no!
- Let her go, Mary!
Let her go!
- Wait.
- Toshiko, tell them to give me the transporter.
- I can't, Mary.
Ridiculous.
We're unarmed and we're just shouting at her.
Not again, please.
God, not again.
Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out.
You.
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.
Your choice.
No, no, not Gwen.
- Just put the knife down.
- Did you hear him?
He didn't want you, did he?
She read my thoughts.
She actually read my thoughts.
What happened?
Did he not want...
What did he say?
Please don't.
That's what they think of you.
That's who you've been working with for all these years.
- It's not true, Tosh.
Don't listen.
- But not me.
Whatever I've done, it doesn't change the way I feel about you.
We have a connection, Toshiko, something real.
Toshiko, don't move.
Don't do anything until I say.
- Please.
- Okay.
You want the transporter, we want Toshiko.
I think that's a fair swap.
I've been trained for these hostage situations.
For God's sake, Gwen, think.
Keep the knife, and I'll give you the transporter myself.
He's just going to let her go.
It's a bluff, but thank God, it's going to work.
You smell different to them.
That's nothing.
It's when you compare teeth with a British guy, that's when it's really scary.
- What are you?
- I don't know.
And you would have put me in a cage?
- What's happening?
- Oh, that.
I reprogrammed it for you.
It's set to enable... sort of now.
What did she...
Has she gone home?
I reset the coordinates.
- Where to?
- To the center of the sun.
It shouldn't be hot.
I mean, we sent her there at night and everything.
- You killed her?
- Yes.
- Just ask her.
- I will, Owen, but give it a bit of time.
It's fucking sly.
Say something to her...
Owen, I don't know what you want me to do.
She's been through enough.
- Look, it's really creeping me out.
- Okay, all right.
I don't know...
Owen, don't be selfish about this.
All right!
- When did you have this, I don't know, ability?
- Just a couple of days.
- What did you hear?
- A lot of it was noise, emotions.
References I wouldn't understand.
- Yeah, and the rest?
- The rest was none of my business.
No, it wasn't.
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me, neither.
We can't really take the moral high ground over this.
- This thing between me and Owen, it...
- No, Gwen.
What I did was an invasion.
I wasn't in control.
I realise that now.
Even so, I can't...
I have to live with this.
Not what I heard, but what I did to you.
- And my betrayal?
- What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop.
But I won't.
What does that say about me?
I'm not really in a position to make judgments.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.
Neither am I.
Don't let this...
It doesn't matter.
Sorry, forget it.
- What?
- Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days, you've had a look about you.
Love suited you.
It's funny.
Such a small thing.
It could be the most powerful piece of technology we've ever found.
It could tear down governments, wipe out armies.
- What do we do with it?
- Your call.
It's a curse.
Why couldn't I read your mind?
I don't know.
Though I could feel you scrabbling around in there.
But I got nothing.
It's like you were, I don't know, dead.
I want that list for UNIT on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...
What do bosses do in situations like these?
You know, regular bosses.
Do I get to beat people?
We've got rules for that.
Red tape.
Jack?
Something Mary said, probably the only honest thing she ever did say...
I asked her why she gave it to me and she said, "After a while it gets to you.
"It changes how you see people."
How can I live with it?
There are some things we're not supposed to know.
You got a snapshot, nothing more.
I don't mean about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.
I mean the whole world.
Doesn't matter.
Now these people are paying the price, ripped apart with your name written in their own blood.
It brings people back to life.
We could question the murder victims.
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
There's gotta be a link between the victims.
Find the link, find the killer.
It's time Suzie came back.
We've been talking to the wrong corpse.
Torchwood.
Outside the Government, beyond the Police.
Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future.
The 21st century is when everything changes, and you've got to be ready.
Nearly there.
We've been right busy since you lot were billeted here.
This your first time?
The others been teasing you, is that it?
My name's Mary.
Mary, like the virgin.
Religious man, are ya?
I'm not your bloody hound.
Whore!
Do whores have prayers?
Once, just once, I'd like to walk into one of these tents and find it's a party.
You know, food, drink, people dancing, girl crying in the corner.
Is it alien?
And how.
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite, pyroxene, and even Dark Matter.
Any idea what it is?
Not a clue.
Could be a weapon, or a really big stapler.
How's our friend there?
She's dead.
Yeah, thanks, Quincy She?
Judging by the size of her skull.
How long have they been here, Tosh?
From the depth they found them...
196 years, 11 to 11.5 months.
The earth's been disturbed so I'm afraid I can't be more accurate.
What killed her?
The stapler?
Nah.
See those shattered ribs?
I reckon she was shot.
Well, let's get her back to the Hub and find out.
You're so light!
You're like a girl.
I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.
But I guess I don't need to tell you that.
I'm really sorry, I think your computer might be dead.
You're kidding.
What happened?
OK, so she said I was no good at sport...
Hello?
!
So I said, "Throw something to me and... "
What happened to the computer?
Oh.
I kicked out the plug.
What?
It was running a translation programme I'd written.
I'd collated every scrap of alien language we've got, and broken it down into binary threads to see if there was a common derivation.
That's a bit of a mouthful.
Sorry.
Private joke.
Um, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.
We've got a job to do.
She's right.
You're right, Tosh, I'm sorry.
Do you know what, Tosh?
Sometimes I think even that stick up your arse has got a stick up its arse.
The guy over there's been staring at me all evening, and I told him he's wasting his time but he won't listen, so I've come over to talk to you because I know how this ends -
he gets a punch in the neck and I get barred, and I've already been barred from about 20 pubs.
And I don't want to get barred from this one because they do these nice olives on the tables.
Right.
OK, then.
Cool.
Let me get you a drink.
Really, there's no need.
JD and Coke, and...
Toshiko, what do you want?
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, yeah.
That was the other thing.
I kind of know who you are.
I think you're mistaken.
Toshiko Sato.
Born in London, 1975, moved to Osaka when you were two, then back to the UK in 1986.
Parents in the RAF, grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.
Very impressive.
University... blah-blah, snapped up to Government science think tank when you were 20, recruited to Torchwood three years ago.
I saw you at the building site this morning.
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?
There's stuff on the internet, but you have to dig really deep.
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from police radio scanners, we also...
We?
Scavengers.
Collectors.
Just like you.
How many of there are you?
Oh, listen, don't think it's in any way organised.
It's really just a disparate bunch of IT guys who live with their mothers.
I shouldn't talk to you.
So go.
What's most amazing are the similarities with our own culture.
But that can be horrible, because we find lots of weapons, and it just makes you think, "My God, everything wages war. "
It's not just a trait of ours, but a trait of existence.
It makes you feel so hopeless.
But then there are times...
We found this thing, it was about A4 size, and it had all these symbols on it.
And it took me about three months to translate, and it was a letter someone had written to his family, to his children, to say how much he was missing them.
And it just made me cry, because I thought, even across these unimaginable distances, there are fundamentals that stay exactly the same.
And there's no-one to talk to about this.
I mean, the guys at work, they're great, but they don't...
see it the way I do.
I could be fired... just for telling you that.
I want to show you something.
It's a pendant.
Put it on.
I'll drink one more, then just drive slowly.
Does coffee count as food if you take sugar?
If he tugs his groin one more time, I'll smack him in the face...
I should have said it was Hammer Time when she asked what the time was.
That would have made them laugh.
What are they?
I can hear voices.
Bloody Sudoku...
Did I send that email?
Did I click "reply to all"?
They're people's thoughts.
He doesn't touch me any more.
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.
'I wish I'd shagged that single dad I met. '
'What's that Asian girl doing - having a fit or something?
'
It's...
They're so loud.
'She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?
'Marcus reckons he's done it with two lesbians, lucky sod.
'How would it work?
' That man over there with...
I can hear him.
OK, Toshiko, I need you to focus.
I can hear all of them.
'Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out. '
It's so... 'Just me.
There's no-one else but me.
Can you hear me?
'Can you hear me now?
'OK, I want you to home in on just MY thoughts.
'Ignore everything else.
There's just so much... '
'You can do it.
It takes practice, but this is what you have to learn.
'Now, what am I thinking?
'This is so hard...
'Follow my voice.
What am I thinking?
'You're thinking...
That I want to kiss you... '
I'm sorry, that was...
No, look, it's...
Sometimes you can't control...
I know, it's fine.
Where did you get it?
It's been in the family a long time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
It's more than incredible.
With this, you can read people's minds.
It levels the pitch between man and God.
Is it alien?
I guess.
No, I want you to keep it.
What?
I can't, Mary.
Please.
I've kept it too long.
After a while, it gets...
You hear too much.
It changes how you... see people.
I'll have to show it to the others.
What?
Nothing.
Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding my CV on the internet?
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.
Because I will.
Yeah.
But you won't.
Good morning.
Yeah, hi... Ianto.
'What the hell would produce such a perfect circular puncture?
'Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.
'She'd better not go into one about the computer again. ' Morning.
'Sergeant giving it all, "Oh, Gwennie has deigned to call her old mates. "
'Should put a weevil in his bathroom.
' I've got something to show you.
Sure. 'Please don't make us sit through another slideshow about the Incas or whatever it was.
'I want a biscuit. '
Have I got time for a pee first?
'Oh, the jeans in the boots thing has really kind of had its day. '
I...
I found this thing... 'What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.
'Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet. ' OK.
Um, I don't know if this comes under actual technology.
'I can smell Owen on me from that shag in his car this morning.
'That's twice now - does that make it an arrangement?
Has to be more than two times surely...
'Long as we keep it to just the two times we're fine.
What's Tosh looking at?
' You OK, Tosh?
'When she ran her tongue across my teeth...
'I should have worn different trousers
- I'm gonna have to sit down till this subsides a bit. '
Yeah.
No.
Fine.
So what is it you wanted to show us?
'I wonder if I could get Owen to come down to the vault.
No, couldn't have sex in front of a weevil.
'I couldn't even do it in front of Trevor Kendall's cat. ' Forget it.
It's...
I found this article...
I'll bring it in tomorrow.
No worries. 'But thanks for that rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh. '
'Can't imagine the time when this isn't everything.
'Pain so constant, like my stomach's full of rats.
'Feels like this is all I am now.
'There isn't an inch of me that doesn't hurt. '
I'm about to brew some of Jack's industrial strength coffee.
Would you like a cup?
I'm...
I'm fine.
Thanks, Ianto.
Might have known you'd have my address as well.
Did you tell them?
No.
I didn't.
What made you change your mind?
You listened to them, didn't you?
See, I told you!
Isn't it incredible?
Some of the stuff you hear...
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?
I told you.
The things I heard.
What they thought of me, what they really thought.
God, these are people that are supposed to like me!
They do like you.
People are complicated, they...
OK, I should have warned you about this.
It isn't like reading someone's diary.
The stuff you've been hearing, it's so deep, so personal - stuff they're not even aware they're thinking.
You think you know someone, then suddenly you see them for real, and they're... bastard little kids.
Not everything.
Not everyone.
I wouldn't say your thoughts were exactly pure.
At least they're consistent.
No agenda.
No resentment.
They pity me.
You don't pity me.
Why would I?
What you're thinking now, that's pretty graphic.
That wasn't my thought.
What?
I wasn't thinking anything, that wasn't my thought.
It must have been yours.
That one!
There!
That's yours.
Yeah, that was mine.
I, um, certainly seem to be enjoying myself.
You would.
You will.
You have no ashtrays in your whole house, not one.
What are you using?
I think it's an egg cup.
You OK?
Freaking out a little?
Your birthday's July, right?
You're the expert.
Isn't it a little late to still have your cards up?
What? "Lots of love, Owen. "
I'm guessing that's Owen from work.
Owen from the building site yesterday morning.
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
Put that down.
All I'm saying is, I don't want to get in the way of anything.
There's nothing to get in the way of.
I see.
You want to talk about it?
Not really.
It's OK.
Wouldn't be the first time I'd been a rebound shag.
You weren't, OK?
Nothing's happened, nothing will ever happen.
Just one of the delightful things I found out, thanks to your bloody pendant.
It's not all bad, the pendant.
Some of the things it can do are extraordinary.
What good could ever come of that?
You need to work that out for yourself.
You need to go somewhere public, somewhere crowded.
What am I looking for?
It will find you.
I'm sick of these riddles.
What's going on?
Where did you get this?
I told you.
Who are you, Mary?
Is that even your real name?
OK.
Here's another name.
Philoctetes.
I'm Philoctetes.
'Bandage my hand, say I shut it in the car door, that'll explain why the signatures don't match. '
'Gives me an hour before Lisa gets back to dress up.
'I've got to be careful.
'She's started to notice her tights are baggy at the crotch. '
'All giggly, and I'm sat there with my boobs like something out of the National Geographic.
'Six cigarettes today, and all of them post-coital glorious.
'Ah, Mr Bond, I've been expecting you.
'Some people should be prohibited from wearing a thong.
'What's that girl looking at?
'I'm gonna kill them.
'I'm gonna kill them.
I'm gonna kill them.
'Lay their bodies out afterwards, and lie next to them.
'I'll have to do myself lying down.
I should have practised that. '
Sorry.
'I'll wear my glasses cos it makes me look more sensitive. '
'If Lawrence come in and finds us, he'll know it's right, and what he's been doing is trespassing. '
'I won't miss anything.
'I won't miss this city, miss this body, I won't miss anything. '
All right, Danny?
I want him back at six.
And I mean six this time.
Kelly's given me 90 minutes after-hours at the tanning salon as a wedding present.
Besides, you're breaking the law bringing him home late.
My dad reckons I could have you arrested, so think on.
Hey.
Get your shoes on and go to the toilet.
What's that face?
I don't wanna go.
Well, you have to.
Lawrence will be here in a minute, and we're looking at napkins.
It's boring.
Well, take your Space Invaders.
Lawrence bought him that.
Don't hear a peep out of him now.
Mind, that's Lawrence all over - dead thoughtful.
Not like some.
Oh, and no cola.
I don't want him coming home all excited.
Thought you'd stopped going fishing.
I have.
Oh, my God, Neil, what are you doing?
!
I was thinking of the Isle of Wight.
Do you remember?
We had that chalet... around when Danny was walking, and the chalet was just full of spiders and you called me your hero, because I wasn't scared
- I'd just pick them up and throw them out.
Oh, my God, Neil!
No, you're scaring me!
And it was this perfect little memory.
We were happy because we were together.
And all this nonsense with Lawrence, it's fine,
I forgive you.
Because I'm looking at the bigger picture now.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Christ!
Oh, no, don't!
Please!
It's OK, it's just like falling asleep.
Really.
Don't do this, to Danny, please!
And then we will be together forever.
It's OK.
You're OK now.
Plodders.
♪ The leg bone's connected to the hip bone... ♪
Please stop singing.
Anything to stop you singing!
I don't know what you're laughing at!
Stop singing, please don't sing, please don't sing.
What's going on?
You know the skeleton we found at the site?
Well, Amanda Burton here has just completed the post-mortem.
OK, I can explain.
As you may remember, at the building site, Owen said this was a woman killed by a single gunshot.
I'd been there, like, a minute?
Since then he's had to tweak some of his initial conclusions.
The first being that this isn't, in fact, a woman, but a man.
A young man.
A very girly man.
But still ultimately a man.
Then there was the cause of death.
Owen said GSW.
Uh-UHH!
The correct answer was...
Unidentified trauma.
But...
Unidentified trauma?
You see it in RTAs, when something like a steering column or a post goes into a body at great velocity.
But the one thing that could be ruled out was...
Gunshot wound.
Gunshot wound.
Was there, in fact, any part of your prognosis that was right?
I got that it was a... skeleton.
Yes, you did.
You've just passed the point of...
Where did you train?
Where did you train?
DID you train?
Jack, um, do you know anything about Greek mythology?
Security visa 45895.
Harkness.
A little, why?
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.
You went to a pub quiz?
Yeah.
No, I love pub quizzes.
Down at the Prince of...
Tides.
Philoctetes was an archer recruited to fight in the Trojan War.
He got into an argument and was marooned on the island of Lemnos for about ten years.
Just left there?
Hey!
What's happening with that list for UNIT?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I'm still working on it.
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready...
Prime Minister, is this a secure line?
Can you tell me why Torchwood operations have become part of your security briefings to the leader of the Opposition?
This is incredible.
This is THE most incredible thing I ever heard.
They should make an action figure of you.
You were right, about the pendant.
I see it now - it can be used for good.
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?
I didn't tell them.
I think that's wise.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kiss you now.
Mary, no.
Listen!
You do something unbelievably brave and sexy, I have to kiss you.
I don't make the rules.
So...
What's happening with the thing you found on the building site?
Don't know, my boss is dealing with that.
I thought you did all the technological stuff.
I do, but sometimes our jobs overlap a bit.
I'm doing...
There's an admin thing he's asked me to do.
Don't you have a secretary for that?
It's actually quite complicated.
So, what's he found out?
I don't know.
He's not said anything.
That's kind of strange.
It isn't, it's fine.
No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from you, there's bound to be a reason.
You're not still worrying about that, are you?
OK, so I'm thinking if it isn't a gunshot or a musket shot, or whatever they had then, maybe it was some kind of ritual.
You are gorgeous!
I start looking into devil-worship and stuff from that era, see if there's anything about plucking out hearts, and would you believe it?
There's nothing.
They ate eyeballs, they drank blood, they had sex with animals, but they did not pluck out each other's hearts.
Cos obviously that would have been weird
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat to society any more.
Yeah, I know.
It's just, there's something...
Does that remind you of anything?
Um..
That bit in Alien where that thing bursts out of John Hurt?
I'm sorry
- I should have been more specific.
Does that remind you of anything helpful?
No.
Sorry.
Right.
Erm, just go over there, do your computer stuff and think about shoes, eh?
Thank you.
Has Jack said anything to you about the hardware we found with the skeleton?
No, why?
'Check there were any hospitals nearby.
'Could have been someone died in an operation.
This has sugar in it. '
No worries.
Just asking.
Hello. 'Keep looking at the skeleton, don't look at her. '
'You're grinning... ' Hey, Tosh.
That coffee going begging?
'What's the matter?
Why isn't he looking at me?
'
There's copies of that Michael Hamilton statement on your desk.
He's still seeing Cybermen outside his mother's house.
'Don't think about her palm on the bottom of my spine, her hand in my hair. '
I think I'll just go over there.
OK.
I'll phone Social Services, see if there's a history of mental illness. 'No, Gwen, this is good.
'It can't go on.
This is a good thing.
Why the hell isn't he looking at me?
' I think my desk is on fire.
So I've just come from a really interesting conversation with a Detective Inspector Henderson.
Right.
Interesting because, firstly, the man had the biggest hands I've ever seen, and secondly... because of the story he told me about you saving a woman and her kid from being murdered by her ex-husband.
Yeah, no, I was going to tell you about that.
So why didn't you?
I don't know, it wasn't a work thing, just a... thing thing.
Stuff happens all the time that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?
So you secretly fight crime, is that it, Tosh?
I didn't want it to look like I was showing off.
The guy they arrested, Henderson, said you heard him muttering to himself as he was walking along, and that's what tipped you off.
Mm.
I couldn't really work out what he was saying at first, and then it was like, "Jesus!"
That's weird because when I'm about to murder someone,
I'm careful not to talk to myself about it while I'm in the street.
No, sure.
I mean, that's lesson one.
I was wondering how you were getting on with this.
It's ongoing.
Are you going to dismantle it?
Like I said, it's ongoing.
What?
Have I got something on my face?
Is it food?
No.
Sorry.
I zoned out.
Well, listen, that was a good save, Tosh.
Well done.
OK, so I've got crisps, I've got coffee - real coffee - wine...
I'm giving them the pendant.
Right, let's...
You're right, it's not like reading someone's diary.
It's so much worse, and it makes me feel dirty and ashamed...
And now, I've been spying on my friends.
Some friends.
What's that supposed to mean?
They pity you, they exclude you!
They've got you doing bloody admin!
So?
No.
I've made up my mind.
Toshiko, don't do this.
So they'll probably want to talk to you - why do you care?
It's the pendant they're interested in, they don't care about you.
I go in that place, I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come here.
Put the phone down.
OK.
I'll show you.
This is why you can't tell them.
You're cold.
Who are you?
Still the person you kissed.
The person you caressed.
Say something.
So...
I'm shagging a woman and an alien.
Which is worse?
Well, I know which one my parents would say.
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be anything bigger than this?
The freedom you have.
When I first got here, I found it almost obscene.
My world was savage.
Enforced worship in temples the size of cities, execution squads roaming the streets.
Dissent of any kind meant death... or transportation, to what they'd call a feral outpost.
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.
It's how we've communicated for centuries.
Speaking orally, using a pre-arranged and finite number of words, it's so archaic.
And kind of gross to look at.
The machine you found is a transporter.
It brought me here, it can get me home again.
I need it back before you dismantle it.
But won't you be in danger?
200 years have passed.
There'll be a new government.
There'll have been 20 new governments by now.
Then why hasn't someone come back for you?
I've been forgotten.
Like Philoctetes on Lemnos.
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you, fix the transporter, get you back home.
You won't!
You'll examine me, assess whether or not I'm useful, whether I'm a danger, then lock me in a cell.
You're not interested in understanding alien cultures.
It's just as well you haven't got the technology to reach other planets yet.
Yours is a culture of invasion.
Do you really think I'm going to walk, hands raised in surrender, into that?
'Silence when the door opens.
Can't do another night of the silence... '
'His hands were cold.
'Giving it all, "We'll call Social Services," over a few bruises?
!
'
'The whole inheritance is going on sheltered accommodation...
'Calling it Grandad's little secret... '
'I can't stand it any more.
'The weight of it.
The depravity. '
The fear...
It fills me up.
It's in my mouth, and my hair, and my eyes.
Marmer...
Like I'm drowning in ink.
What am I doing...?
"Heart removed.
"Records and post-mortem passed to Operation Lowry. " Operation Lowry...
And even when I don't have the pendant on, even when there's nothing, I can't forget the things I've seen, the things I've heard.
Heart removed.
Heart removed.
Removed...
How far back does it go?
It's like a curse, something the gods send to drive someone mad.
I had hope.
I'd see something, some little random act of kindness, and it made me think we were safe, there was some essential good in us.
This is impossible.
But there isn't.
It's like one of the weevils.
You look inside, and there's just this great yawning scream.
This is completely impossible.
You were right.
Everything you said about us.
We're frightened and we're callous.
Owen.
You need to see this.
And I can't be part of it any longer.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do!
Get me into Torchwood.
"In Xanadu, did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree...
"Where Alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man,
"down to a sunless sea. "
So, where is it, lover?
Stay here.
Jack, my boss, has got it.
Be quick.
I've a long journey ahead of me.
I might need something to eat before I go.
This what you're looking for?
Jack!
Friend of mine - let's call him Vincent.
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend, likes his sport, likes a beer.
He starts acting a little... strange, a little distracted.
Suddenly he disappears for a couple of months.
He comes back, and we've gotta start calling him Vanessa.
Since then I've always been a little nervous when a friend behaves out of character.
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.
Jack Harkness.
My guess is you're not from around these parts.
Now this...
This is incredible.
You know what it is?
It's a transporter.
Mary was a political prisoner - she was exiled here.
Look, Jack...
You've got half of it right.
Mary...
It is Mary, isn't it?
You want to tell her the really interesting bit?
No?
Chatty, isn't she?
I don't know how you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.
It's a two-man transporter.
Or whatever you people may be.
You might be squids, for all I know.
A two-squid transporter.
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what happened to the guard, Mary?
I killed him.
But I was disturbed.
Then another came - a soldier.
He tried to shoot me.
Do whores have prayers?
So I plunged my new human hand into his chest and plucked out his heart.
And that's what you've been doing ever since.
This form needs to be fed.
All the punctures were all about the size of a fist.
My God, all those people.
You killed all those people.
I fled before any more soldiers came.
I had so much to explore!
And how I loved this body.
So soft.
So wicked.
The power such a body has in this world.
Within a few years the forest had gone, transporter was safely buried under the spread of the city.
I didn't care, I wasn't exactly in a hurry to get home.
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when my situation here became complicated, but I was safe, as long as I knew where the transporter was.
'The way she looks at you with those eyes - she's like an animal. '
'When they brought that girl into the hospital, I had only been qualified six months.
'I wanted to throw up. ' And then the machine was uncovered.
As soon as the air touched its surface, I could feel it.
'She's just talking, she's not even frightened of us, she's just talking. '
So I found my Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.
'Gonna go for it now. ' Owen, NO!
Let her go, Mary!
Let her go!
Toshiko, tell them to give me the transporter.
I can't, Mary.
'It's ridiculous - we're unarmed, we're just shouting at her.
Not again.
Please, God, not again. '
'Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out. '
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.
Your choice. 'No, no, not Gwen. '
Just put the knife down.
Did you hear him?
He didn't want to, did he?
'She read my thoughts, she actually read my thoughts. '
'What happened?
What did he say?
'
Please, don't...
That's what they think of you.
That's who you've been working with for all these years.
It's not true, Tosh, don't listen.
But not me.
Whatever I've done, it doesn't change the way I feel about you.
We have a connection, Toshiko, something real.
'Toshiko...
Don't move.
'Don't do anything until I say. '
OK, you want the transporter, we want Toshiko.
'I've been trained for this hostage situation...
'For God's sake, think!
'
I think that's a fair swap.
Keep the knife and I'll give you the transporter myself.
'He's just going to let her go. '
It's a bluff, but I think it's going to work.
You smell... different to them.
That's nothing.
It's when you compare teeth with a British guy, that's when it's really scary.
What are you?
I don't know.
And you would have put me in a cage?
What's happening?
Oh, that.
I re-programmed it for you.
It's set to enable.
Sort of now.
What did she...?
Has she gone home?
I reset the co-ordinates.
Where to?
To the centre of the sun.
It shouldn't be hot.
I mean, we sent her there at night and everything.
You killed her.
Yes.
Just ask her.
I will, but give me a bit of time.
Say something to her.
What do want me to do?
She's been through enough.
It's really creeping me out.
All right!
Owen, don't be selfish about this.
All right!
When did you have this...
I don't know... ability?
Just a couple of days.
What did you hear?
A lot of it was noise.
Emotions.
References I wouldn't understand.
Yeah, and the rest?
The rest was none of my business.
No.
It wasn't.
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me neither.
We can't really take the moral high ground over this.
This thing between me and Owen, it...
No, Gwen.
What I did was an invasion.
I wasn't in control, I realise that now.
But even so, I can't...
I have to live with this.
Not what I heard, but what I did to you.
And my betrayal?
What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop.
But I won't.
What does that say about me?
I'm not really in a position to make judgements.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.
Neither am I.
Don't let this...
It doesn't matter.
Sorry, forget it.
What?
Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days, you've had a look about you.
Love suited you.
It's funny.
Such a small thing.
It could be the most powerful piece of technology we've ever found.
It could tear down governments, wipe out armies.
What do we do with it?
Your call.
It's a curse.
Why couldn't I read your mind?
I don't know.
Though I could feel you scrabbling around in there.
I got nothing.
It's like you were...
I don't know... dead.
I want that list for UNIT on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...
What do bosses do in situations like these?
Y'know, regular bosses.
Can I get to beat people?
We've got rules for that!
Red tape.
Jack...
Something Mary said...
Probably the only honest thing she ever did say.
I asked her why she gave it to me.
And she said, "After a while it gets to you.
"It changes how you see people. "
How can I live with it?
There are some things we're not supposed to know.
You got a snapshot - nothing more.
I don't mean about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.
I mean...
The whole world...
It doesn't matter.
Now these people are paying the price, ripped apart with your name written in their own blood.
It brings people back to life.
We just question the murder victims.
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
There's got to be a link between the victims.
Find the link, find the killer.
It's time Suzie came back.
We've been talking to the wrong corpse.
Torchwood.
Outside the Government, beyond the Police.
Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future.
The 21st century is when everything changes, and you've got to be ready.
Nearly there.
We've been right busy since you lot were billeted here.
This your first time?
The others been teasing you, is that it?
My name's Mary.
Mary, like the virgin.
Religious man, are ya?
I'm not your bloody hound.
Whore!
METALLIC WHOOSHING
Do whores have prayers?
Once, just once, I'd like to walk into one of these tents and find it's a party.
You know, food, drink, people dancing, girl crying in the corner.
Is it alien?
And how.
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite, pyroxene, and even Dark Matter.
Any idea what it is?
Not a clue.
Could be a weapon, or a really big stapler.
How's our friend there?
She's dead.
Yeah, thanks, Quincy She?
Judging by the size of her skull.
How long have they been here, Tosh?
From the depth they found them...
196 years, 11 to 11.5 months.
The earth's been disturbed so I'm afraid I can't be more accurate.
What killed her?
The stapler?
Nah.
See those shattered ribs?
I reckon she was shot.
Well, let's get her back to the Hub and find out.
You're so light!
You're like a girl.
I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.
But I guess I don't need to tell you that.
I'm really sorry, I think your computer might be dead.
You're kidding.
What happened?
OK, so she said I was no good at sport...
Hello?
!
So I said, "Throw something to me and... "
What happened to the computer?
Oh.
I kicked out the plug.
What?
It was running a translation programme I'd written.
I'd collated every scrap of alien language we've got, and broken it down into binary threads to see if there was a common derivation.
That's a bit of a mouthful.
Sorry.
Private joke.
Um, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.
We've got a job to do.
She's right.
You're right, Tosh, I'm sorry.
Do you know what, Tosh?
Sometimes I think even that stick up your arse has got a stick up its arse.
The guy over there's been staring at me all evening, and I told him he's wasting his time but he won't listen, so I've come over to talk to you because I know how this ends -
he gets a punch in the neck and I get barred, and I've already been barred from about 20 pubs.
And I don't want to get barred from this one because they do these nice olives on the tables.
Right.
OK, then.
Cool.
Let me get you a drink.
Really, there's no need.
JD and Coke, and...
Toshiko, what do you want?
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, yeah.
That was the other thing.
I kind of know who you are.
I think you're mistaken.
Toshiko Sato.
Born in London, 1975, moved to Osaka when you were two, then back to the UK in 1986.
Parents in the RAF, grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.
Very impressive.
University... blah-blah, snapped up to Government science think tank when you were 20, recruited to Torchwood three years ago.
I saw you at the building site this morning.
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?
There's stuff on the internet, but you have to dig really deep.
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from police radio scanners, we also...
We?
Scavengers.
Collectors.
Just like you.
How many of there are you?
Oh, listen, don't think it's in any way organised.
It's really just a disparate bunch of IT guys who live with their mothers.
I shouldn't talk to you.
So go.
What's most amazing are the similarities with our own culture.
But that can be horrible, because we find lots of weapons, and it just makes you think, "My God, everything wages war. "
It's not just a trait of ours, but a trait of existence.
It makes you feel so hopeless.
But then there are times...
We found this thing, it was about A4 size, and it had all these symbols on it.
And it took me about three months to translate, and it was a letter someone had written to his family, to his children, to say how much he was missing them.
And it just made me cry, because I thought, even across these unimaginable distances, there are fundamentals that stay exactly the same.
And there's no-one to talk to about this.
I mean, the guys at work, they're great, but they don't...
see it the way I do.
I could be fired... just for telling you that.
I want to show you something.
It's a pendant.
Put it on.
I'll drink one more, then just drive slowly.
Does coffee count as food if you take sugar?
If he tugs his groin one more time, I'll smack him in the face...
I should have said it was Hammer Time when she asked what the time was.
That would have made them laugh.
What are they?
I can hear voices.
Bloody Sudoku...
Did I send that email?
Did I click "reply to all"?
They're people's thoughts.
He doesn't touch me any more.
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.
'I wish I'd shagged that single dad I met. '
'What's that Asian girl doing - having a fit or something?
'
It's...
They're so loud.
'She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?
'Marcus reckons he's done it with two lesbians, lucky sod.
'How would it work?
' That man over there with...
I can hear him.
OK, Toshiko, I need you to focus.
I can hear all of them.
'Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out. '
It's so... 'Just me.
There's no-one else but me.
Can you hear me?
'Can you hear me now?
'OK, I want you to home in on just MY thoughts.
'Ignore everything else.
There's just so much... '
'You can do it.
It takes practice, but this is what you have to learn.
'Now, what am I thinking?
'This is so hard...
'Follow my voice.
What am I thinking?
'You're thinking...
That I want to kiss you... '
I'm sorry, that was...
No, look, it's...
Sometimes you can't control...
I know, it's fine.
Where did you get it?
It's been in the family a long time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
It's more than incredible.
With this, you can read people's minds.
It levels the pitch between man and God.
Is it alien?
I guess.
No, I want you to keep it.
What?
I can't, Mary.
Please.
I've kept it too long.
After a while, it gets...
You hear too much.
It changes how you... see people.
I'll have to show it to the others.
What?
Nothing.
Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding my CV on the internet?
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.
Because I will.
Yeah.
But you won't.
Good morning.
Yeah, hi... Ianto.
'What the hell would produce such a perfect circular puncture?
'Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.
'She'd better not go into one about the computer again. ' Morning.
'Sergeant giving it all, "Oh, Gwennie has deigned to call her old mates. "
'Should put a weevil in his bathroom.
' I've got something to show you.
Sure. 'Please don't make us sit through another slideshow about the Incas or whatever it was.
'I want a biscuit. '
Have I got time for a pee first?
'Oh, the jeans in the boots thing has really kind of had its day. '
I...
I found this thing... 'What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.
'Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet. ' OK.
Um, I don't know if this comes under actual technology.
'I can smell Owen on me from that shag in his car this morning.
'That's twice now - does that make it an arrangement?
Has to be more than two times surely...
'Long as we keep it to just the two times we're fine.
What's Tosh looking at?
' You OK, Tosh?
'When she ran her tongue across my teeth...
'I should have worn different trousers
- I'm gonna have to sit down till this subsides a bit. '
Yeah.
No.
Fine.
So what is it you wanted to show us?
'I wonder if I could get Owen to come down to the vault.
No, couldn't have sex in front of a weevil.
'I couldn't even do it in front of Trevor Kendall's cat. ' Forget it.
It's...
I found this article...
I'll bring it in tomorrow.
No worries. 'But thanks for that rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh. '
'Can't imagine the time when this isn't everything.
'Pain so constant, like my stomach's full of rats.
'Feels like this is all I am now.
'There isn't an inch of me that doesn't hurt. '
I'm about to brew some of Jack's industrial strength coffee.
Would you like a cup?
I'm...
I'm fine.
Thanks, Ianto.
Might have known you'd have my address as well.
Did you tell them?
No.
I didn't.
What made you change your mind?
You listened to them, didn't you?
See, I told you!
Isn't it incredible?
Some of the stuff you hear...
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?
I told you.
The things I heard.
What they thought of me, what they really thought.
God, these are people that are supposed to like me!
They do like you.
People are complicated, they...
OK, I should have warned you about this.
It isn't like reading someone's diary.
The stuff you've been hearing, it's so deep, so personal - stuff they're not even aware they're thinking.
You think you know someone, then suddenly you see them for real, and they're... bastard little kids.
Not everything.
Not everyone.
I wouldn't say your thoughts were exactly pure.
At least they're consistent.
No agenda.
No resentment.
They pity me.
You don't pity me.
Why would I?
What you're thinking now, that's pretty graphic.
That wasn't my thought.
What?
I wasn't thinking anything, that wasn't my thought.
It must have been yours.
That one!
There!
That's yours.
Yeah, that was mine.
I, um, certainly seem to be enjoying myself.
You would.
You will.
You have no ashtrays in your whole house, not one.
What are you using?
I think it's an egg cup.
You OK?
Freaking out a little?
Your birthday's July, right?
You're the expert.
Isn't it a little late to still have your cards up?
What? "Lots of love, Owen. "
I'm guessing that's Owen from work.
Owen from the building site yesterday morning.
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
Put that down.
All I'm saying is, I don't want to get in the way of anything.
There's nothing to get in the way of.
I see.
You want to talk about it?
Not really.
It's OK.
Wouldn't be the first time I'd been a rebound shag.
You weren't, OK?
Nothing's happened, nothing will ever happen.
Just one of the delightful things I found out, thanks to your bloody pendant.
It's not all bad, the pendant.
Some of the things it can do are extraordinary.
What good could ever come of that?
You need to work that out for yourself.
You need to go somewhere public, somewhere crowded.
What am I looking for?
It will find you.
I'm sick of these riddles.
What's going on?
Where did you get this?
I told you.
Who are you, Mary?
Is that even your real name?
OK.
Here's another name.
Philoctetes.
I'm Philoctetes.
MULTIPLE VOICES
'Bandage my hand, say I shut it in the car door, that'll explain why the signatures don't match. '
'Gives me an hour before Lisa gets back to dress up.
'I've got to be careful.
'She's started to notice her tights are baggy at the crotch. '
'All giggly, and I'm sat there with my boobs like something out of the National Geographic.
'Six cigarettes today, and all of them post-coital glorious.
'Ah, Mr Bond, I've been expecting you.
'Some people should be prohibited from wearing a thong.
'What's that girl looking at?
'I'm gonna kill them.
'I'm gonna kill them.
I'm gonna kill them.
'Lay their bodies out afterwards, and lie next to them.
'I'll have to do myself lying down.
I should have practised that. '
Sorry.
'I'll wear my glasses cos it makes me look more sensitive. '
'If Lawrence come in and finds us, he'll know it's right, and what he's been doing is trespassing. '
'I won't miss anything.
'I won't miss this city, miss this body, I won't miss anything. '
All right, Danny?
I want him back at six.
And I mean six this time.
Kelly's given me 90 minutes after-hours at the tanning salon as a wedding present.
Besides, you're breaking the law bringing him home late.
My dad reckons I could have you arrested, so think on.
Hey.
Get your shoes on and go to the toilet.
What's that face?
I don't wanna go.
Well, you have to.
Lawrence will be here in a minute, and we're looking at napkins.
It's boring.
Well, take your Space Invaders.
Lawrence bought him that.
Don't hear a peep out of him now.
Mind, that's Lawrence all over - dead thoughtful.
Not like some.
Oh, and no cola.
I don't want him coming home all excited.
Thought you'd stopped going fishing.
I have.
Oh, my God, Neil, what are you doing?
!
I was thinking of the Isle of Wight.
Do you remember?
We had that chalet... around when Danny was walking, and the chalet was just full of spiders and you called me your hero, because I wasn't scared
- I'd just pick them up and throw them out.
Oh, my God, Neil!
No, you're scaring me!
And it was this perfect little memory.
We were happy because we were together.
And all this nonsense with Lawrence, it's fine,
I forgive you.
Because I'm looking at the bigger picture now.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Christ!
Oh, no, don't!
Please!
It's OK, it's just like falling asleep.
Really.
Don't do this, to Danny, please!
And then we will be together forever.
It's OK.
You're OK now.
Plodders.
# The leg bone's connected to the hip bone... #
Please stop singing.
Anything to stop you singing!
I don't know what you're laughing at!
Stop singing, please don't sing, please don't sing.
What's going on?
You know the skeleton we found at the site?
Well, Amanda Burton here has just completed the post-mortem.
OK, I can explain.
As you may remember, at the building site, Owen said this was a woman killed by a single gunshot.
I'd been there, like, a minute?
Since then he's had to tweak some of his initial conclusions.
The first being that this isn't, in fact, a woman, but a man.
A young man.
A very girly man.
But still ultimately a man.
Then there was the cause of death.
Owen said GSW.
Uh-UHH!
The correct answer was...
Unidentified trauma.
But...
Unidentified trauma?
You see it in RTAs, when something like a steering column or a post goes into a body at great velocity.
But the one thing that could be ruled out was...
Gunshot wound.
Gunshot wound.
Was there, in fact, any part of your prognosis that was right?
I got that it was a... skeleton.
Yes, you did.
You've just passed the point of...
Where did you train?
Where did you train?
DID you train?
Jack, um, do you know anything about Greek mythology?
Security visa 45895.
Harkness.
A little, why?
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.
You went to a pub quiz?
Yeah.
No, I love pub quizzes.
Down at the Prince of...
Tides.
Philoctetes was an archer recruited to fight in the Trojan War.
He got into an argument and was marooned on the island of Lemnos for about ten years.
Just left there?
Hey!
What's happening with that list for UNIT?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I'm still working on it.
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready...
Prime Minister, is this a secure line?
Can you tell me why Torchwood operations have become part of your security briefings to the leader of the Opposition?
This is incredible.
This is THE most incredible thing I ever heard.
They should make an action figure of you.
You were right, about the pendant.
I see it now - it can be used for good.
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?
I didn't tell them.
I think that's wise.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kiss you now.
Mary, no.
Listen!
You do something unbelievably brave and sexy, I have to kiss you.
I don't make the rules.
So...
What's happening with the thing you found on the building site?
Don't know, my boss is dealing with that.
I thought you did all the technological stuff.
I do, but sometimes our jobs overlap a bit.
I'm doing...
There's an admin thing he's asked me to do.
Don't you have a secretary for that?
It's actually quite complicated.
So, what's he found out?
I don't know.
He's not said anything.
That's kind of strange.
It isn't, it's fine.
No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from you, there's bound to be a reason.
You're not still worrying about that, are you?
OK, so I'm thinking if it isn't a gunshot or a musket shot, or whatever they had then, maybe it was some kind of ritual.
You are gorgeous!
I start looking into devil-worship and stuff from that era, see if there's anything about plucking out hearts, and would you believe it?
There's nothing.
They ate eyeballs, they drank blood, they had sex with animals, but they did not pluck out each other's hearts.
Cos obviously that would have been weird
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat to society any more.
Yeah, I know.
It's just, there's something...
Does that remind you of anything?
Um..
That bit in Alien where that thing bursts out of John Hurt?
I'm sorry
- I should have been more specific.
Does that remind you of anything helpful?
No.
Sorry.
Right.
Erm, just go over there, do your computer stuff and think about shoes, eh?
Thank you.
Has Jack said anything to you about the hardware we found with the skeleton?
No, why?
'Check there were any hospitals nearby.
'Could have been someone died in an operation.
This has sugar in it. '
No worries.
Just asking.
Hello. 'Keep looking at the skeleton, don't look at her. '
'You're grinning... ' Hey, Tosh.
That coffee going begging?
'What's the matter?
Why isn't he looking at me?
'
There's copies of that Michael Hamilton statement on your desk.
He's still seeing Cybermen outside his mother's house.
'Don't think about her palm on the bottom of my spine, her hand in my hair. '
I think I'll just go over there.
OK.
I'll phone Social Services, see if there's a history of mental illness. 'No, Gwen, this is good.
'It can't go on.
This is a good thing.
Why the hell isn't he looking at me?
' I think my desk is on fire.
So I've just come from a really interesting conversation with a Detective Inspector Henderson.
Right.
Interesting because, firstly, the man had the biggest hands I've ever seen, and secondly... because of the story he told me about you saving a woman and her kid from being murdered by her ex-husband.
Yeah, no, I was going to tell you about that.
So why didn't you?
I don't know, it wasn't a work thing, just a... thing thing.
Stuff happens all the time that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?
So you secretly fight crime, is that it, Tosh?
I didn't want it to look like I was showing off.
The guy they arrested, Henderson, said you heard him muttering to himself as he was walking along, and that's what tipped you off.
Mm.
I couldn't really work out what he was saying at first, and then it was like, "Jesus!"
That's weird because when I'm about to murder someone,
I'm careful not to talk to myself about it while I'm in the street.
No, sure.
I mean, that's lesson one.
I was wondering how you were getting on with this.
It's ongoing.
Are you going to dismantle it?
Like I said, it's ongoing.
What?
Have I got something on my face?
Is it food?
No.
Sorry.
I zoned out.
Well, listen, that was a good save, Tosh.
Well done.
OK, so I've got crisps, I've got coffee - real coffee - wine...
I'm giving them the pendant.
Right, let's...
You're right, it's not like reading someone's diary.
It's so much worse, and it makes me feel dirty and ashamed...
And now, I've been spying on my friends.
Some friends.
What's that supposed to mean?
They pity you, they exclude you!
They've got you doing bloody admin!
So?
No.
I've made up my mind.
Toshiko, don't do this.
So they'll probably want to talk to you - why do you care?
It's the pendant they're interested in, they don't care about you.
I go in that place, I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come here.
Put the phone down.
OK.
I'll show you.
This is why you can't tell them.
You're cold.
Who are you?
Still the person you kissed.
The person you caressed.
Say something.
So...
I'm shagging a woman and an alien.
Which is worse?
Well, I know which one my parents would say.
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be anything bigger than this?
The freedom you have.
When I first got here, I found it almost obscene.
My world was savage.
Enforced worship in temples the size of cities, execution squads roaming the streets.
Dissent of any kind meant death... or transportation, to what they'd call a feral outpost.
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.
It's how we've communicated for centuries.
Speaking orally, using a pre-arranged and finite number of words, it's so archaic.
And kind of gross to look at.
The machine you found is a transporter.
It brought me here, it can get me home again.
I need it back before you dismantle it.
But won't you be in danger?
200 years have passed.
There'll be a new government.
There'll have been 20 new governments by now.
Then why hasn't someone come back for you?
I've been forgotten.
Like Philoctetes on Lemnos.
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you, fix the transporter, get you back home.
You won't!
You'll examine me, assess whether or not I'm useful, whether I'm a danger, then lock me in a cell.
You're not interested in understanding alien cultures.
It's just as well you haven't got the technology to reach other planets yet.
Yours is a culture of invasion.
Do you really think I'm going to walk, hands raised in surrender, into that?
'Silence when the door opens.
Can't do another night of the silence... '
'His hands were cold.
'Giving it all, "We'll call Social Services," over a few bruises?
!
'
'The whole inheritance is going on sheltered accommodation...
'Calling it Grandad's little secret... '
'I can't stand it any more.
'The weight of it.
The depravity. '
The fear...
It fills me up.
It's in my mouth, and my hair, and my eyes.
Marmer...
Like I'm drowning in ink.
What am I doing...?
"Heart removed.
"Records and post-mortem passed to Operation Lowry. " Operation Lowry...
And even when I don't have the pendant on, even when there's nothing, I can't forget the things I've seen, the things I've heard.
Heart removed.
Heart removed.
Removed...
How far back does it go?
It's like a curse, something the gods send to drive someone mad.
I had hope.
I'd see something, some little random act of kindness, and it made me think we were safe, there was some essential good in us.
This is impossible.
But there isn't.
It's like one of the weevils.
You look inside, and there's just this great yawning scream.
This is completely impossible.
You were right.
Everything you said about us.
We're frightened and we're callous.
Owen.
You need to see this.
And I can't be part of it any longer.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do!
Get me into Torchwood.
"In Xanadu, did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree...
"Where Alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man,
"down to a sunless sea. "
So, where is it, lover?
Stay here.
Jack, my boss, has got it.
Be quick.
I've a long journey ahead of me.
I might need something to eat before I go.
This what you're looking for?
Jack!
Friend of mine - let's call him Vincent.
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend, likes his sport, likes a beer.
He starts acting a little... strange, a little distracted.
Suddenly he disappears for a couple of months.
He comes back, and we've gotta start calling him Vanessa.
Since then I've always been a little nervous when a friend behaves out of character.
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.
Jack Harkness.
My guess is you're not from around these parts.
Now this...
This is incredible.
You know what it is?
It's a transporter.
Mary was a political prisoner - she was exiled here.
Look, Jack...
You've got half of it right.
Mary...
It is Mary, isn't it?
You want to tell her the really interesting bit?
No?
Chatty, isn't she?
I don't know how you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.
It's a two-man transporter.
Or whatever you people may be.
You might be squids, for all I know.
A two-squid transporter.
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what happened to the guard, Mary?
I killed him.
But I was disturbed.
Then another came - a soldier.
He tried to shoot me.
Do whores have prayers?
So I plunged my new human hand into his chest and plucked out his heart.
And that's what you've been doing ever since.
This form needs to be fed.
All the punctures were all about the size of a fist.
My God, all those people.
You killed all those people.
I fled before any more soldiers came.
I had so much to explore!
And how I loved this body.
So soft.
So wicked.
The power such a body has in this world.
Within a few years the forest had gone, transporter was safely buried under the spread of the city.
I didn't care, I wasn't exactly in a hurry to get home.
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when my situation here became complicated, but I was safe, as long as I knew where the transporter was.
'The way she looks at you with those eyes - she's like an animal. '
'When they brought that girl into the hospital, I had only been qualified six months.
'I wanted to throw up. ' And then the machine was uncovered.
As soon as the air touched its surface, I could feel it.
'She's just talking, she's not even frightened of us, she's just talking. '
So I found my Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.
'Gonna go for it now. ' Owen, NO!
Let her go, Mary!
Let her go!
Toshiko, tell them to give me the transporter.
I can't, Mary.
'It's ridiculous - we're unarmed, we're just shouting at her.
Not again.
Please, God, not again. '
'Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out. '
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.
Your choice. 'No, no, not Gwen. '
Just put the knife down.
Did you hear him?
He didn't want to, did he?
'She read my thoughts, she actually read my thoughts. '
'What happened?
What did he say?
'
Please, don't...
That's what they think of you.
That's who you've been working with for all these years.
It's not true, Tosh, don't listen.
But not me.
Whatever I've done, it doesn't change the way I feel about you.
We have a connection, Toshiko, something real.
'Toshiko...
Don't move.
'Don't do anything until I say. '
OK, you want the transporter, we want Toshiko.
'I've been trained for this hostage situation...
'For God's sake, think!
'
I think that's a fair swap.
Keep the knife and I'll give you the transporter myself.
'He's just going to let her go. '
It's a bluff, but I think it's going to work.
You smell... different to them.
That's nothing.
It's when you compare teeth with a British guy, that's when it's really scary.
What are you?
I don't know.
And you would have put me in a cage?
What's happening?
Oh, that.
I re-programmed it for you.
It's set to enable.
Sort of now.
What did she...?
Has she gone home?
I reset the co-ordinates.
Where to?
To the centre of the sun.
It shouldn't be hot.
I mean, we sent her there at night and everything.
You killed her.
Yes.
Just ask her.
I will, but give me a bit of time.
Say something to her.
What do want me to do?
She's been through enough.
It's really creeping me out.
All right!
Owen, don't be selfish about this.
All right!
When did you have this...
I don't know... ability?
Just a couple of days.
What did you hear?
A lot of it was noise.
Emotions.
References I wouldn't understand.
Yeah, and the rest?
The rest was none of my business.
No.
It wasn't.
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me neither.
We can't really take the moral high ground over this.
This thing between me and Owen, it...
No, Gwen.
What I did was an invasion.
I wasn't in control, I realise that now.
But even so, I can't...
I have to live with this.
Not what I heard, but what I did to you.
And my betrayal?
What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop.
But I won't.
What does that say about me?
I'm not really in a position to make judgements.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.
Neither am I.
Don't let this...
It doesn't matter.
Sorry, forget it.
What?
Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days, you've had a look about you.
Love suited you.
It's funny.
Such a small thing.
It could be the most powerful piece of technology we've ever found.
It could tear down governments, wipe out armies.
What do we do with it?
Your call.
It's a curse.
Why couldn't I read your mind?
I don't know.
Though I could feel you scrabbling around in there.
I got nothing.
It's like you were...
I don't know... dead.
I want that list for UNIT on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...
What do bosses do in situations like these?
Y'know, regular bosses.
Can I get to beat people?
We've got rules for that!
Red tape.
Jack...
Something Mary said...
Probably the only honest thing she ever did say.
I asked her why she gave it to me.
And she said, "After a while it gets to you.
"It changes how you see people. "
How can I live with it?
There are some things we're not supposed to know.
You got a snapshot - nothing more.
I don't mean about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.
I mean...
The whole world...
It doesn't matter.
Now these people are paying the price, ripped apart with your name written in their own blood.
It brings people back to life.
We just question the murder victims.
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
There's got to be a link between the victims.
Find the link, find the killer.
It's time Suzie came back.
We've been talking to the wrong corpse.

Torchwood.
Outside the Government, beyond the Police.
Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future.
The 21st century is when everything changes, and you've got to be ready.
Nearly there.
We've been right busy since you lot were billeted here.
This your first time?
The others been teasing you, is that it?
My name's Mary.
Mary, like the virgin.
Religious man, are ya?
I'm not your bloody hound.
Whore!
METALLIC WHOOSHING
Do whores have prayers?
Once, just once, I'd like to walk into one of these tents and find it's a party.
You know, food, drink, people dancing, girl crying in the corner.
Is it alien?
And how.
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite, pyroxene, and even Dark Matter.
Any idea what it is?
Not a clue.
Could be a weapon, or a really big stapler.
How's our friend there?
She's dead.
Yeah, thanks, Quincy(!
) She?
Judging by the size of her skull.
How long have they been here, Tosh?
From the depth they found them...
196 years, 11 to 11.5 months.
The earth's been disturbed so I'm afraid I can't be more accurate.
What killed her?
The stapler?
Nah.
See those shattered ribs?
I reckon she was shot.
Well, let's get her back to the Hub and find out.
You're so light!
You're like a girl.
I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.
But I guess I don't need to tell you that.
I'm really sorry, I think your computer might be dead.
You're kidding.
What happened?
OK, so she said I was no good at sport...
Hello?
!
So I said, "Throw something to me and..."
What happened to the computer?
Oh.
I kicked out the plug.
What?
It was running a translation programme I'd written.
I'd collated every scrap of alien language we've got, and broken it down into binary threads to see if there was a common derivation.
That's a bit of a mouthful.
Sorry.
Private joke.
Um, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.
We've got a job to do.
She's right.
You're right, Tosh, I'm sorry.
Do you know what, Tosh?
Sometimes I think even that stick up your arse has got a stick up its arse.
The guy over there's been staring at me all evening, and I told him he's wasting his time but he won't listen, so I've come over to talk to you because I know how this ends -
he gets a punch in the neck and I get barred, and I've already been barred from about 20 pubs.
And I don't want to get barred from this one because they do these nice olives on the tables.
Right.
OK, then.
Cool.
Let me get you a drink.
Really, there's no need.
JD and Coke, and...
Toshiko, what do you want?
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, yeah.
That was the other thing.
I kind of know who you are.
I think you're mistaken.
Toshiko Sato.
Born in London, 1975, moved to Osaka when you were two, then back to the UK in 1986.
Parents in the RAF, grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.
Very impressive.
University...blah-blah, snapped up to Government science think tank when you were 20, recruited to Torchwood three years ago.
I saw you at the building site this morning.
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?
There's stuff on the internet, but you have to dig really deep.
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from police radio scanners, we also...
We?
Scavengers.
Collectors.
Just like you.
How many of there are you?
Oh, listen, don't think it's in any way organised.
It's really just a disparate bunch of IT guys who live with their mothers.
I shouldn't talk to you.
So go.
What's most amazing are the similarities with our own culture.
But that can be horrible, because we find lots of weapons, and it just makes you think, "My God, everything wages war."
It's not just a trait of ours, but a trait of existence.
It makes you feel so hopeless.
But then there are times...
We found this thing, it was about A4 size, and it had all these symbols on it.
And it took me about three months to translate, and it was a letter someone had written to his family, to his children, to say how much he was missing them.
And it just made me cry, because I thought, even across these unimaginable distances, there are fundamentals that stay exactly the same.
And there's no-one to talk to about this.
I mean, the guys at work, they're great, but they don't...
see it the way I do.
I could be fired...just for telling you that.
I want to show you something.
It's a pendant.
Put it on.
VOICES ECHO:
I'll drink one more, then just drive slowly.

I should have said it was Hammer Time when she asked what the time was.
That would have made them laugh.
What are they?
I can hear voices.
Bloody Sudoku...
Did I send that email?
Did I click "reply to all"?
They're people's thoughts.
He doesn't touch me any more.
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.
'I wish I'd shagged that single dad I met.'
'What's that Asian girl doing - having a fit or something?
'
It's...
They're so loud.
'She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?
'Marcus reckons he's done it with two lesbians, lucky sod.
'How would it work?
' That man over there with...
I can hear him.
OK, Toshiko, I need you to focus.
I can hear all of them.
'Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out.'
It's so... 'Just me.
There's no-one else but me.
Can you hear me?
'Can you hear me now?
'OK, I want you to home in on just MY thoughts.
'Ignore everything else.
There's just so much...'
'You can do it.
It takes practice, but this is what you have to learn.
'Now, what am I thinking?
'This is so hard...
'Follow my voice.
What am I thinking?
'You're thinking...
That I want to kiss you...'
I'm sorry, that was...
No, look, it's...
Sometimes you can't control...
I know, it's fine.
Where did you get it?
It's been in the family a long time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
It's more than incredible.
With this, you can read people's minds.
It levels the pitch between man and God.
Is it alien?
I guess.
No, I want you to keep it.
What?
I can't, Mary.
Please.
I've kept it too long.
After a while, it gets...
You hear too much.
It changes how you...see people.
I'll have to show it to the others.
What?
Nothing.
Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding my CV on the internet?
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.
Because I will.
Yeah.
But you won't.
Good morning.
Yeah, hi...
Ianto.
'What the hell would produce such a perfect circular puncture?
'Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.
'She'd better not go into one about the computer again.' Morning.
'Sergeant giving it all, "Oh, Gwennie has deigned to call her old mates."
'Should put a weevil in his bathroom.' I've got something to show you.
Sure. 'Please don't make us sit through another slideshow about the Incas or whatever it was.
'I want a biscuit.'
Have I got time for a pee first?
'Oh, the jeans in the boots thing has really kind of had its day.'
I...
I found this thing...
'What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.
'Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet.' OK.
Um, I don't know if this comes under actual technology.
'I can smell Owen on me from that shag in his car this morning.
'That's twice now - does that make it an arrangement?
Has to be more than two times surely...
'Long as we keep it to just the two times we're fine.
What's Tosh looking at?
' You OK, Tosh?
'When she ran her tongue across my teeth...
'I should have worn different trousers
- I'm gonna have to sit down till this subsides a bit.'
Yeah.
No.
Fine.
So what is it you wanted to show us?
'I wonder if I could get Owen to come down to the vault.
No, couldn't have sex in front of a weevil.
'I couldn't even do it in front of Trevor Kendall's cat.' Forget it.
It's...
I found this article...
I'll bring it in tomorrow.
No worries. 'But thanks for that rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh.'
'Can't imagine the time when this isn't everything.
'Pain so constant, like my stomach's full of rats.
'Feels like this is all I am now.
'There isn't an inch of me that doesn't hurt.'
I'm about to brew some of Jack's industrial strength coffee.
Would you like a cup?
I'm...
I'm fine.
Thanks, Ianto.
Might have known you'd have my address as well.
Did you tell them?
No.
I didn't.
What made you change your mind?
You listened to them, didn't you?
See, I told you!
Isn't it incredible?
Some of the stuff you hear...
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?
I told you.
The things I heard.
What they thought of me, what they really thought.
God, these are people that are supposed to like me!
They do like you.
People are complicated, they...
OK, I should have warned you about this.
It isn't like reading someone's diary.
The stuff you've been hearing, it's so deep, so personal - stuff they're not even aware they're thinking.
You think you know someone, then suddenly you see them for real, and they're...bastard little kids.
Not everything.
Not everyone.
I wouldn't say your thoughts were exactly pure.
At least they're consistent.
No agenda.
No resentment.
They pity me.
You don't pity me.
Why would I?
What you're thinking now, that's pretty graphic.
That wasn't my thought.
What?
I wasn't thinking anything, that wasn't my thought.
It must have been yours.
That one!
There!
That's yours.
Yeah, that was mine.
I, um, certainly seem to be enjoying myself.
You would.
You will.
You have no ashtrays in your whole house, not one.
What are you using?
I think it's an egg cup.
You OK?
Freaking out a little?
Your birthday's July, right?
You're the expert.
Isn't it a little late to still have your cards up?
What? "Lots of love, Owen."
I'm guessing that's Owen from work.
Owen from the building site yesterday morning.
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
Put that down.
All I'm saying is, I don't want to get in the way of anything.
There's nothing to get in the way of.
I see.
You want to talk about it?
Not really.
It's OK.
Wouldn't be the first time I'd been a rebound shag.
You weren't, OK?
Nothing's happened, nothing will ever happen.
Just one of the delightful things I found out, thanks to your bloody pendant.
It's not all bad, the pendant.
Some of the things it can do are extraordinary.
What good could ever come of that?
You need to work that out for yourself.
You need to go somewhere public, somewhere crowded.
What am I looking for?
It will find you.
I'm sick of these riddles.
What's going on?
Where did you get this?
I told you.
Who are you, Mary?
Is that even your real name?
OK.
Here's another name.
Philoctetes.
I'm Philoctetes.

I don't wanna go.
Well, you have to.
Lawrence will be here in a minute, and we're looking at napkins.
It's boring.
Well, take your Space Invaders.
Lawrence bought him that.
Don't hear a peep out of him now.
Mind, that's Lawrence all over - dead thoughtful.
Not like some.
Oh, and no cola.
I don't want him coming home all excited.
Thought you'd stopped going fishing.
I have.
Oh, my God, Neil, what are you doing?
!
I was thinking of the Isle of Wight.
Do you remember?
We had that chalet...around when Danny was walking, and the chalet was just full of spiders and you called me your hero, because I wasn't scared
- I'd just pick them up and throw them out.
Oh, my God, Neil!
No, you're scaring me!
And it was this perfect little memory.
We were happy because we were together.
And all this nonsense with Lawrence, it's fine,
I forgive you.

Oh, Christ!
Oh, no, don't!

Don't do this, to Danny, please!

Please stop singing.
Anything to stop you singing!
I don't know what you're laughing at!
Stop singing, please don't sing, please don't sing.
What's going on?
You know the skeleton we found at the site?
Well, Amanda Burton here has just completed the post-mortem.
OK, I can explain.
As you may remember, at the building site, Owen said this was a woman killed by a single gunshot.
I'd been there, like, a minute?
Since then he's had to tweak some of his initial conclusions.
The first being that this isn't, in fact, a woman, but a man.
A young man.
A very girly man.
But still ultimately a man.
Then there was the cause of death.
Owen said GSW.
Uh-UHH!
The correct answer was...
Unidentified trauma.
But...
Unidentified trauma?
You see it in RTAs, when something like a steering column or a post goes into a body at great velocity.
But the one thing that could be ruled out was...
Gunshot wound.
Gunshot wound.
Was there, in fact, any part of your prognosis that was right?
I got that it was a...skeleton.
Yes, you did.
You've just passed the point of...
Where did you train?
Where did you train?
DID you train?
Jack, um, do you know anything about Greek mythology?
Security visa 45895.
Harkness.
A little, why?
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.
You went to a pub quiz?
Yeah.
No, I love pub quizzes.
Down at the Prince of...
Tides.
Philoctetes was an archer recruited to fight in the Trojan War.
He got into an argument and was marooned on the island of Lemnos for about ten years.
Just left there?
Hey!
What's happening with that list for UNIT?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I'm still working on it.
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready...
Prime Minister, is this a secure line?
Can you tell me why Torchwood operations have become part of your security briefings to the leader of the Opposition?
This is incredible.
This is THE most incredible thing I ever heard.
They should make an action figure of you.
You were right, about the pendant.
I see it now - it can be used for good.
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?
I didn't tell them.
I think that's wise.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kiss you now.
Mary, no.
Listen!
You do something unbelievably brave and sexy, I have to kiss you.
I don't make the rules.
So...
What's happening with the thing you found on the building site?
Don't know, my boss is dealing with that.
I thought you did all the technological stuff.
I do, but sometimes our jobs overlap a bit.
I'm doing...
There's an admin thing he's asked me to do.
Don't you have a secretary for that?
It's actually quite complicated.
So, what's he found out?
I don't know.
He's not said anything.
That's kind of strange.
It isn't, it's fine.
No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from you, there's bound to be a reason.
You're not still worrying about that, are you?
OK, so I'm thinking if it isn't a gunshot or a musket shot, or whatever they had then, maybe it was some kind of ritual.
You are gorgeous!
I start looking into devil-worship and stuff from that era, see if there's anything about plucking out hearts, and would you believe it?
There's nothing.
They ate eyeballs, they drank blood, they had sex with animals, but they did not pluck out each other's hearts.
Cos obviously that would have been weird(!
)
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat to society any more.
Yeah, I know.
It's just, there's something...
Does that remind you of anything?
Um..
That bit in Alien where that thing bursts out of John Hurt?
I'm sorry
- I should have been more specific.
Does that remind you of anything helpful?
No.
Sorry.
Right.
Erm, just go over there, do your computer stuff and think about shoes, eh?
Thank you.
Has Jack said anything to you about the hardware we found with the skeleton?
No, why?
'Check there were any hospitals nearby.
'Could have been someone died in an operation.
This has sugar in it.'
No worries.
Just asking.
Hello. 'Keep looking at the skeleton, don't look at her.'
'You're grinning...' Hey, Tosh.
That coffee going begging?
'What's the matter?
Why isn't he looking at me?
'
There's copies of that Michael Hamilton statement on your desk.
He's still seeing Cybermen outside his mother's house.
'Don't think about her palm on the bottom of my spine, her hand in my hair.'
I think I'll just go over there.
OK.
I'll phone Social Services, see if there's a history of mental illness. 'No, Gwen, this is good.
'It can't go on.
This is a good thing.
Why the hell isn't he looking at me?
' I think my desk is on fire.
So I've just come from a really interesting conversation with a Detective Inspector Henderson.
Right.
Interesting because, firstly, the man had the biggest hands I've ever seen, and secondly... because of the story he told me about you saving a woman and her kid from being murdered by her ex-husband.
Yeah, no, I was going to tell you about that.
So why didn't you?
I don't know, it wasn't a work thing, just a...thing thing.
Stuff happens all the time that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?
So you secretly fight crime, is that it, Tosh?
I didn't want it to look like I was showing off.
The guy they arrested, Henderson, said you heard him muttering to himself as he was walking along, and that's what tipped you off.
Mm.
I couldn't really work out what he was saying at first, and then it was like, "Jesus!"
That's weird because when I'm about to murder someone,
I'm careful not to talk to myself about it while I'm in the street.
No, sure.
I mean, that's lesson one.
I was wondering how you were getting on with this.
It's ongoing.
Are you going to dismantle it?
Like I said, it's ongoing.
What?
Have I got something on my face?
Is it food?
No.
Sorry.
I zoned out.
Well, listen, that was a good save, Tosh.
Well done.
OK, so I've got crisps, I've got coffee - real coffee - wine...
I'm giving them the pendant.
Right, let's...
You're right, it's not like reading someone's diary.
It's so much worse, and it makes me feel dirty and ashamed...
And now, I've been spying on my friends.
Some friends.
What's that supposed to mean?
They pity you, they exclude you!
They've got you doing bloody admin!
So?
No.
I've made up my mind.
Toshiko, don't do this.
So they'll probably want to talk to you - why do you care?
It's the pendant they're interested in, they don't care about you.
I go in that place, I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come here.
DISTORTED:
Put the phone down.
OK.
I'll show you.
This is why you can't tell them.
You're cold.
Who are you?
Still the person you kissed.
The person you caressed.
Say something.
So...
I'm shagging a woman and an alien.
Which is worse?
Well, I know which one my parents would say.
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be anything bigger than this?
The freedom you have.
When I first got here, I found it almost obscene.
My world was savage.
Enforced worship in temples the size of cities, execution squads roaming the streets.
Dissent of any kind meant death... or transportation, to what they'd call a feral outpost.
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.
It's how we've communicated for centuries.
Speaking orally, using a pre-arranged and finite number of words, it's so archaic.
And kind of gross to look at.
The machine you found is a transporter.
It brought me here, it can get me home again.
I need it back before you dismantle it.
But won't you be in danger?
200 years have passed.
There'll be a new government.
There'll have been 20 new governments by now.
Then why hasn't someone come back for you?
I've been forgotten.
Like Philoctetes on Lemnos.
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you, fix the transporter, get you back home.
You won't!
You'll examine me, assess whether or not I'm useful, whether I'm a danger, then lock me in a cell.
You're not interested in understanding alien cultures.
It's just as well you haven't got the technology to reach other planets yet.
Yours is a culture of invasion.
Do you really think I'm going to walk, hands raised in surrender, into that?
'Silence when the door opens.
Can't do another night of the silence...'
'His hands were cold.
'Giving it all, "We'll call Social Services," over a few bruises?
!
'
'The whole inheritance is going on sheltered accommodation...
'Calling it Grandad's little secret...'
'I can't stand it any more.
'The weight of it.
The depravity.'
The fear...
It fills me up.
It's in my mouth, and my hair, and my eyes.
Marmer...
Like I'm drowning in ink.
What am I doing...?
"Heart removed.
"Records and post-mortem passed to Operation Lowry." Operation Lowry...
And even when I don't have the pendant on, even when there's nothing, I can't forget the things I've seen, the things I've heard.
Heart removed.
Heart removed.
Removed...
How far back does it go?
It's like a curse, something the gods send to drive someone mad.
I had hope.
I'd see something, some little random act of kindness, and it made me think we were safe, there was some essential good in us.
This is impossible.
But there isn't.
It's like one of the weevils.
You look inside, and there's just this great yawning scream.
This is completely impossible.
You were right.
Everything you said about us.
We're frightened and we're callous.
Owen.
You need to see this.
And I can't be part of it any longer.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do!
Get me into Torchwood.
"In Xanadu, did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree...
"Where Alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man,
"down to a sunless sea."
So, where is it, lover?
Stay here.
Jack, my boss, has got it.
Be quick.
I've a long journey ahead of me.
I might need something to eat before I go.
This what you're looking for?
Jack!
Friend of mine - let's call him Vincent.
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend, likes his sport, likes a beer.
He starts acting a little...strange, a little distracted.
Suddenly he disappears for a couple of months.
He comes back, and we've gotta start calling him Vanessa.
Since then I've always been a little nervous when a friend behaves out of character.
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.
Jack Harkness.
My guess is you're not from around these parts.
Now this...
This is incredible.
You know what it is?
It's a transporter.
Mary was a political prisoner - she was exiled here.
Look, Jack...
You've got half of it right.
Mary...
It is Mary, isn't it?
You want to tell her the really interesting bit?
No?
Chatty, isn't she?
I don't know how you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.
It's a two-man transporter.
Or whatever you people may be.
You might be squids, for all I know.
A two-squid transporter.
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what happened to the guard, Mary?
I killed him.
But I was disturbed.
Then another came - a soldier.
He tried to shoot me.
Do whores have prayers?
So I plunged my new human hand into his chest and plucked out his heart.
And that's what you've been doing ever since.
This form needs to be fed.
All the punctures were all about the size of a fist.
My God, all those people.
You killed all those people.
I fled before any more soldiers came.
I had so much to explore!
And how I loved this body.
So soft.
So wicked.
The power such a body has in this world.
Within a few years the forest had gone, transporter was safely buried under the spread of the city.
I didn't care, I wasn't exactly in a hurry to get home.
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when my situation here became complicated, but I was safe, as long as I knew where the transporter was.
'The way she looks at you with those eyes - she's like an animal.'
'When they brought that girl into the hospital, I had only been qualified six months.
'I wanted to throw up.' And then the machine was uncovered.
As soon as the air touched its surface, I could feel it.
'She's just talking, she's not even frightened of us, she's just talking.'
So I found my Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.
'Gonna go for it now.' Owen, NO!
Let her go, Mary!
Let her go!
Toshiko, tell them to give me the transporter.
I can't, Mary.
'It's ridiculous - we're unarmed, we're just shouting at her.
Not again.
Please, God, not again.'
'Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out.'
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.
Your choice. 'No, no, not Gwen.'
Just put the knife down.
Did you hear him?
He didn't want to, did he?
'She read my thoughts, she actually read my thoughts.'
'What happened?
What did he say?
'
Please, don't...
That's what they think of you.
That's who you've been working with for all these years.
It's not true, Tosh, don't listen.
But not me.
Whatever I've done, it doesn't change the way I feel about you.
We have a connection, Toshiko, something real.
'Toshiko...
Don't move.
'Don't do anything until I say.'
OK, you want the transporter, we want Toshiko.
'I've been trained for this hostage situation...
'For God's sake, think!
'
I think that's a fair swap.
Keep the knife and I'll give you the transporter myself.
'He's just going to let her go.'
It's a bluff, but I think it's going to work.
You smell... different to them.
That's nothing.
It's when you compare teeth with a British guy, that's when it's really scary.
What are you?
I don't know.
And you would have put me in a cage?
What's happening?
Oh, that.
I re-programmed it for you.
It's set to enable.
Sort of now.
What did she...?
Has she gone home?
I reset the co-ordinates.
Where to?
To the centre of the sun.
It shouldn't be hot.
I mean, we sent her there at night and everything.
You killed her.
Yes.
Just ask her.
I will, but give me a bit of time.
Say something to her.
What do want me to do?
She's been through enough.
It's really creeping me out.
All right!
Owen, don't be selfish about this.
All right!
When did you have this...
I don't know...ability?
Just a couple of days.
What did you hear?
A lot of it was noise.
Emotions.
References I wouldn't understand.
Yeah, and the rest?
The rest was none of my business.
No.
It wasn't.
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me neither.
We can't really take the moral high ground over this.
This thing between me and Owen, it...
No, Gwen.
What I did was an invasion.
I wasn't in control, I realise that now.
But even so, I can't...
I have to live with this.
Not what I heard, but what I did to you.
And my betrayal?
What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop.
But I won't.
What does that say about me?
I'm not really in a position to make judgements.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.
Neither am I.
Don't let this...
It doesn't matter.
Sorry, forget it.
What?
Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days, you've had a look about you.
Love suited you.
It's funny.
Such a small thing.
It could be the most powerful piece of technology we've ever found.
It could tear down governments, wipe out armies.
What do we do with it?
Your call.
It's a curse.
Why couldn't I read your mind?
I don't know.
Though I could feel you scrabbling around in there.
I got nothing.
It's like you were...
I don't know...dead.
I want that list for UNIT on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...
What do bosses do in situations like these?
Y'know, regular bosses.
Can I get to beat people?
We've got rules for that!
Red tape.
Jack...
Something Mary said...
Probably the only honest thing she ever did say.
I asked her why she gave it to me.
And she said, "After a while it gets to you.
"It changes how you see people."
How can I live with it?
There are some things we're not supposed to know.
You got a snapshot - nothing more.
I don't mean about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.
I mean...
The whole world...
It doesn't matter.
Now these people are paying the price, ripped apart with your name written in their own blood.
It brings people back to life.
We just question the murder victims.
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
There's got to be a link between the victims.
Find the link, find the killer.
It's time Suzie came back.
We've been talking to the wrong corpse.

Torchwood.
Outside the Government, beyond the Police.
Tracking down alien life on Earth and arming the human race against the future.
The 21st century is when everything changes, and you've got to be ready.
Nearly there.
We've been right busy since you lot were billeted here.
This your first time?
The others been teasing you, is that it?
My name's Mary.
Mary, like the virgin.
Religious man, are ya?
I'm not your bloody hound.
Whore!
METALLIC WHOOSHING
Do whores have prayers?
Once, just once, I'd like to walk into one of these tents and find it's a party.
You know, food, drink, people dancing, girl crying in the corner.
Is it alien?
And how.
I'm picking up traces of ilmenite, pyroxene, and even Dark Matter.
Any idea what it is?
Not a clue.
Could be a weapon, or a really big stapler.
How's our friend there?
She's dead.
Yeah, thanks, Quincy(!
) She?
Judging by the size of her skull.
How long have they been here, Tosh?
From the depth they found them...
196 years, 11 to 11.5 months.
The earth's been disturbed so I'm afraid I can't be more accurate.
What killed her?
The stapler?
Nah.
See those shattered ribs?
I reckon she was shot.
Well, let's get her back to the Hub and find out.
You're so light!
You're like a girl.
I'm not light, I'm wiry.
Fat girls go mad for it.
But I guess I don't need to tell you that.
I'm really sorry, I think your computer might be dead.
You're kidding.
What happened?
OK, so she said I was no good at sport...
Hello?
!
So I said, "Throw something to me and..."
What happened to the computer?
Oh.
I kicked out the plug.
What?
It was running a translation programme I'd written.
I'd collated every scrap of alien language we've got, and broken it down into binary threads to see if there was a common derivation.
That's a bit of a mouthful.
Sorry.
Private joke.
Um, stupid joke.
We're supposed to be professionals.
We've got a job to do.
She's right.
You're right, Tosh, I'm sorry.
Do you know what, Tosh?
Sometimes I think even that stick up your arse has got a stick up its arse.
The guy over there's been staring at me all evening, and I told him he's wasting his time but he won't listen, so I've come over to talk to you because I know how this ends -
he gets a punch in the neck and I get barred, and I've already been barred from about 20 pubs.
And I don't want to get barred from this one because they do these nice olives on the tables.
Right.
OK, then.
Cool.
Let me get you a drink.
Really, there's no need.
JD and Coke, and...
Toshiko, what do you want?
I didn't tell you my name.
Oh, yeah.
That was the other thing.
I kind of know who you are.
I think you're mistaken.
Toshiko Sato.
Born in London, 1975, moved to Osaka when you were two, then back to the UK in 1986.
Parents in the RAF, grandfather worked at Bletchley Park.
Very impressive.
University...blah-blah, snapped up to Government science think tank when you were 20, recruited to Torchwood three years ago.
I saw you at the building site this morning.
What was that you had in the case?
How do you know about Torchwood?
There's stuff on the internet, but you have to dig really deep.
Plus, we pick bits and pieces up from police radio scanners, we also...
We?
Scavengers.
Collectors.
Just like you.
How many of there are you?
Oh, listen, don't think it's in any way organised.
It's really just a disparate bunch of IT guys who live with their mothers.
I shouldn't talk to you.
So go.
What's most amazing are the similarities with our own culture.
But that can be horrible, because we find lots of weapons, and it just makes you think, "My God, everything wages war."
It's not just a trait of ours, but a trait of existence.
It makes you feel so hopeless.
But then there are times...
We found this thing, it was about A4 size, and it had all these symbols on it.
And it took me about three months to translate, and it was a letter someone had written to his family, to his children, to say how much he was missing them.
And it just made me cry, because I thought, even across these unimaginable distances, there are fundamentals that stay exactly the same.
And there's no-one to talk to about this.
I mean, the guys at work, they're great, but they don't...
see it the way I do.
I could be fired...just for telling you that.
I want to show you something.
It's a pendant.
Put it on.
VOICES ECHO:
I'll drink one more, then just drive slowly.
Does coffee count as food if you take sugar?
If he tugs his groin one more time, I'll smack him in the face...
I should have said it was Hammer Time when she asked what the time was.
That would have made them laugh.
What are they?
I can hear voices.
Bloody Sudoku...
Did I send that email?
Did I click "reply to all"?
They're people's thoughts.
He doesn't touch me any more.
They're people's thoughts, Toshiko.
'I wish I'd shagged that single dad I met.'
'What's that Asian girl doing - having a fit or something?
'
It's...
They're so loud.
'She's cute, though.
Is that her girlfriend?
'Marcus reckons he's done it with two lesbians, lucky sod.
'How would it work?
' That man over there with...
I can hear him.
OK, Toshiko, I need you to focus.
I can hear all of them.
'Home in on my voice.
Shut everything else out.'
It's so... 'Just me.
There's no-one else but me.
Can you hear me?
'Can you hear me now?
'OK, I want you to home in on just MY thoughts.
'Ignore everything else.
There's just so much...'
'You can do it.
It takes practice, but this is what you have to learn.
'Now, what am I thinking?
'This is so hard...
'Follow my voice.
What am I thinking?
'You're thinking...
That I want to kiss you...'
I'm sorry, that was...
No, look, it's...
Sometimes you can't control...
I know, it's fine.
Where did you get it?
It's been in the family a long time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's incredible.
It's more than incredible.
With this, you can read people's minds.
It levels the pitch between man and God.
Is it alien?
I guess.
No, I want you to keep it.
What?
I can't, Mary.
Please.
I've kept it too long.
After a while, it gets...
You hear too much.
It changes how you...see people.
I'll have to show it to the others.
What?
Nothing.
Just, I bet you don't.
And you know this from finding my CV on the internet?
No, because I know the pendant.
Well, you're wrong.
Because I will.
Yeah.
But you won't.
Good morning.
Yeah, hi...
Ianto.
'What the hell would produce such a perfect circular puncture?
'Maybe some kind of wooden stake.
Hey, Tosh.
'She'd better not go into one about the computer again.' Morning.
'Sergeant giving it all, "Oh, Gwennie has deigned to call her old mates."
'Should put a weevil in his bathroom.' I've got something to show you.
Sure. 'Please don't make us sit through another slideshow about the Incas or whatever it was.
'I want a biscuit.'
Have I got time for a pee first?
'Oh, the jeans in the boots thing has really kind of had its day.'
I...
I found this thing...
'What's she talking about?
She can be dead weird.
'Wonder what she'd be like in bed.
Catholic but grateful, I bet.' OK.
Um, I don't know if this comes under actual technology.
'I can smell Owen on me from that shag in his car this morning.
'That's twice now - does that make it an arrangement?
Has to be more than two times surely...
'Long as we keep it to just the two times we're fine.
What's Tosh looking at?
' You OK, Tosh?
'When she ran her tongue across my teeth...
'I should have worn different trousers
- I'm gonna have to sit down till this subsides a bit.'
Yeah.
No.
Fine.
So what is it you wanted to show us?
'I wonder if I could get Owen to come down to the vault.
No, couldn't have sex in front of a weevil.
'I couldn't even do it in front of Trevor Kendall's cat.' Forget it.
It's...
I found this article...
I'll bring it in tomorrow.
No worries. 'But thanks for that rambling trip to nowhere, Tosh.'
'Can't imagine the time when this isn't everything.
'Pain so constant, like my stomach's full of rats.
'Feels like this is all I am now.
'There isn't an inch of me that doesn't hurt.'
I'm about to brew some of Jack's industrial strength coffee.
Would you like a cup?
I'm...
I'm fine.
Thanks, Ianto.
Might have known you'd have my address as well.
Did you tell them?
No.
I didn't.
What made you change your mind?
You listened to them, didn't you?
See, I told you!
Isn't it incredible?
Some of the stuff you hear...
What is this thing?
Why did you give it to me?
I told you.
The things I heard.
What they thought of me, what they really thought.
God, these are people that are supposed to like me!
They do like you.
People are complicated, they...
OK, I should have warned you about this.
It isn't like reading someone's diary.
The stuff you've been hearing, it's so deep, so personal - stuff they're not even aware they're thinking.
You think you know someone, then suddenly you see them for real, and they're...bastard little kids.
Not everything.
Not everyone.
I wouldn't say your thoughts were exactly pure.
At least they're consistent.
No agenda.
No resentment.
They pity me.
You don't pity me.
Why would I?
What you're thinking now, that's pretty graphic.
That wasn't my thought.
What?
I wasn't thinking anything, that wasn't my thought.
It must have been yours.
That one!
There!
That's yours.
Yeah, that was mine.
I, um, certainly seem to be enjoying myself.
You would.
You will.
You have no ashtrays in your whole house, not one.
What are you using?
I think it's an egg cup.
You OK?
Freaking out a little?
Your birthday's July, right?
You're the expert.
Isn't it a little late to still have your cards up?
What? "Lots of love, Owen."
I'm guessing that's Owen from work.
Owen from the building site yesterday morning.
Owen from the photo on your fridge.
Put that down.
All I'm saying is, I don't want to get in the way of anything.
There's nothing to get in the way of.
I see.
You want to talk about it?
Not really.
It's OK.
Wouldn't be the first time I'd been a rebound shag.
You weren't, OK?
Nothing's happened, nothing will ever happen.
Just one of the delightful things I found out, thanks to your bloody pendant.
It's not all bad, the pendant.
Some of the things it can do are extraordinary.
What good could ever come of that?
You need to work that out for yourself.
You need to go somewhere public, somewhere crowded.
What am I looking for?
It will find you.
I'm sick of these riddles.
What's going on?
Where did you get this?
I told you.
Who are you, Mary?
Is that even your real name?
OK.
Here's another name.
Philoctetes.
I'm Philoctetes.

Oh, my God!
Oh, Christ!
Oh, no, don't!
Please!
It's OK, it's just like falling asleep.
Really.
Don't do this, to Danny, please!
And then we will be together forever.
It's OK.
You're OK now.
Plodders.
# The leg bone's connected to the hip bone... #
Please stop singing.
Anything to stop you singing!
I don't know what you're laughing at!
Stop singing, please don't sing, please don't sing.
What's going on?
You know the skeleton we found at the site?
Well, Amanda Burton here has just completed the post-mortem.
OK, I can explain.
As you may remember, at the building site, Owen said this was a woman killed by a single gunshot.
I'd been there, like, a minute?
Since then he's had to tweak some of his initial conclusions.
The first being that this isn't, in fact, a woman, but a man.
A young man.
A very girly man.
But still ultimately a man.
Then there was the cause of death.
Owen said GSW.
Uh-UHH!
The correct answer was...
Unidentified trauma.
But...
Unidentified trauma?
You see it in RTAs, when something like a steering column or a post goes into a body at great velocity.
But the one thing that could be ruled out was...
Gunshot wound.
Gunshot wound.
Was there, in fact, any part of your prognosis that was right?
I got that it was a...skeleton.
Yes, you did.
You've just passed the point of...
Where did you train?
Where did you train?
DID you train?
Jack, um, do you know anything about Greek mythology?
Security visa 45895.
Harkness.
A little, why?
You ever heard of Philoctetes?
It came up in a pub quiz.
You went to a pub quiz?
Yeah.
No, I love pub quizzes.
Down at the Prince of...
Tides.
Philoctetes was an archer recruited to fight in the Trojan War.
He got into an argument and was marooned on the island of Lemnos for about ten years.
Just left there?
Hey!
What's happening with that list for UNIT?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I'm still working on it.
Right.
Well, you know, when you're ready...
Prime Minister, is this a secure line?
Can you tell me why Torchwood operations have become part of your security briefings to the leader of the Opposition?
This is incredible.
This is THE most incredible thing I ever heard.
They should make an action figure of you.
You were right, about the pendant.
I see it now - it can be used for good.
What did they say at work?
How did you explain it?
I didn't tell them.
I think that's wise.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to kiss you now.
Mary, no.
Listen!
You do something unbelievably brave and sexy, I have to kiss you.
I don't make the rules.
So...
What's happening with the thing you found on the building site?
Don't know, my boss is dealing with that.
I thought you did all the technological stuff.
I do, but sometimes our jobs overlap a bit.
I'm doing...
There's an admin thing he's asked me to do.
Don't you have a secretary for that?
It's actually quite complicated.
So, what's he found out?
I don't know.
He's not said anything.
That's kind of strange.
It isn't, it's fine.
No, sure.
I mean, if he's keeping stuff from you, there's bound to be a reason.
You're not still worrying about that, are you?
OK, so I'm thinking if it isn't a gunshot or a musket shot, or whatever they had then, maybe it was some kind of ritual.
You are gorgeous!
I start looking into devil-worship and stuff from that era, see if there's anything about plucking out hearts, and would you believe it?
There's nothing.
They ate eyeballs, they drank blood, they had sex with animals, but they did not pluck out each other's hearts.
Cos obviously that would have been weird(!
)
Why are you so bothered?
Whoever did this is hardly a threat to society any more.
Yeah, I know.
It's just, there's something...
Does that remind you of anything?
Um..
That bit in Alien where that thing bursts out of John Hurt?
I'm sorry
- I should have been more specific.
Does that remind you of anything helpful?
No.
Sorry.
Right.
Erm, just go over there, do your computer stuff and think about shoes, eh?
Thank you.
Has Jack said anything to you about the hardware we found with the skeleton?
No, why?
'Check there were any hospitals nearby.
'Could have been someone died in an operation.
This has sugar in it.'
No worries.
Just asking.
Hello. 'Keep looking at the skeleton, don't look at her.'
'You're grinning...' Hey, Tosh.
That coffee going begging?
'What's the matter?
Why isn't he looking at me?
'
There's copies of that Michael Hamilton statement on your desk.
He's still seeing Cybermen outside his mother's house.
'Don't think about her palm on the bottom of my spine, her hand in my hair.'
I think I'll just go over there.
OK.
I'll phone Social Services, see if there's a history of mental illness. 'No, Gwen, this is good.
'It can't go on.
This is a good thing.
Why the hell isn't he looking at me?
' I think my desk is on fire.
So I've just come from a really interesting conversation with a Detective Inspector Henderson.
Right.
Interesting because, firstly, the man had the biggest hands I've ever seen, and secondly... because of the story he told me about you saving a woman and her kid from being murdered by her ex-husband.
Yeah, no, I was going to tell you about that.
So why didn't you?
I don't know, it wasn't a work thing, just a...thing thing.
Stuff happens all the time that's not pertinent to here.
You do this all the time?
So you secretly fight crime, is that it, Tosh?
I didn't want it to look like I was showing off.
The guy they arrested, Henderson, said you heard him muttering to himself as he was walking along, and that's what tipped you off.
Mm.
I couldn't really work out what he was saying at first, and then it was like, "Jesus!"
That's weird because when I'm about to murder someone,
I'm careful not to talk to myself about it while I'm in the street.
No, sure.
I mean, that's lesson one.
I was wondering how you were getting on with this.
It's ongoing.
Are you going to dismantle it?
Like I said, it's ongoing.
What?
Have I got something on my face?
Is it food?
No.
Sorry.
I zoned out.
Well, listen, that was a good save, Tosh.
Well done.
OK, so I've got crisps, I've got coffee - real coffee - wine...
I'm giving them the pendant.
Right, let's...
You're right, it's not like reading someone's diary.
It's so much worse, and it makes me feel dirty and ashamed...
And now, I've been spying on my friends.
Some friends.
What's that supposed to mean?
They pity you, they exclude you!
They've got you doing bloody admin!
So?
No.
I've made up my mind.
Toshiko, don't do this.
So they'll probably want to talk to you - why do you care?
It's the pendant they're interested in, they don't care about you.
I go in that place, I won't come out again.
What are you talking about?
They're not the Stasi.
Look, I'll get my boss to come here.
DISTORTED:
Put the phone down.
OK.
I'll show you.
This is why you can't tell them.
You're cold.
Who are you?
Still the person you kissed.
The person you caressed.
Say something.
So...
I'm shagging a woman and an alien.
Which is worse?
Well, I know which one my parents would say.
I read your thoughts.
I didn't see this.
What else are you keeping from me?
You think there could be anything bigger than this?
The freedom you have.
When I first got here, I found it almost obscene.
My world was savage.
Enforced worship in temples the size of cities, execution squads roaming the streets.
Dissent of any kind meant death... or transportation, to what they'd call a feral outpost.
And the pendant?
It's how my people communicate.
It's how we've communicated for centuries.
Speaking orally, using a pre-arranged and finite number of words, it's so archaic.
And kind of gross to look at.
The machine you found is a transporter.
It brought me here, it can get me home again.
I need it back before you dismantle it.
But won't you be in danger?
200 years have passed.
There'll be a new government.
There'll have been 20 new governments by now.
Then why hasn't someone come back for you?
I've been forgotten.
Like Philoctetes on Lemnos.
Let me take you to Torchwood.
Maybe we can help you, fix the transporter, get you back home.
You won't!
You'll examine me, assess whether or not I'm useful, whether I'm a danger, then lock me in a cell.
You're not interested in understanding alien cultures.
It's just as well you haven't got the technology to reach other planets yet.
Yours is a culture of invasion.
Do you really think I'm going to walk, hands raised in surrender, into that?
'Silence when the door opens.
Can't do another night of the silence...'
'His hands were cold.
'Giving it all, "We'll call Social Services," over a few bruises?
!
'
'The whole inheritance is going on sheltered accommodation...
'Calling it Grandad's little secret...'
'I can't stand it any more.
'The weight of it.
The depravity.'
The fear...
It fills me up.
It's in my mouth, and my hair, and my eyes.
Marmer...
Like I'm drowning in ink.
What am I doing...?
"Heart removed.
"Records and post-mortem passed to Operation Lowry." Operation Lowry...
And even when I don't have the pendant on, even when there's nothing, I can't forget the things I've seen, the things I've heard.
Heart removed.
Heart removed.
Removed...
How far back does it go?
It's like a curse, something the gods send to drive someone mad.
I had hope.
I'd see something, some little random act of kindness, and it made me think we were safe, there was some essential good in us.
This is impossible.
But there isn't.
It's like one of the weevils.
You look inside, and there's just this great yawning scream.
This is completely impossible.
You were right.
Everything you said about us.
We're frightened and we're callous.
Owen.
You need to see this.
And I can't be part of it any longer.
I don't know what to do.
Tell me what to do!
Get me into Torchwood.
"In Xanadu, did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure-dome decree...
"Where Alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man,
"down to a sunless sea."
So, where is it, lover?
Stay here.
Jack, my boss, has got it.
Be quick.
I've a long journey ahead of me.
I might need something to eat before I go.
This what you're looking for?
Jack!
Friend of mine - let's call him Vincent.
That was his name, after all.
Regular guy, girlfriend, likes his sport, likes a beer.
He starts acting a little...strange, a little distracted.
Suddenly he disappears for a couple of months.
He comes back, and we've gotta start calling him Vanessa.
Since then I've always been a little nervous when a friend behaves out of character.
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.
Jack Harkness.
My guess is you're not from around these parts.
Now this...
This is incredible.
You know what it is?
It's a transporter.
Mary was a political prisoner - she was exiled here.
Look, Jack...
You've got half of it right.
Mary...
It is Mary, isn't it?
You want to tell her the really interesting bit?
No?
Chatty, isn't she?
I don't know how you got a word in edgeways, Tosh.
It's a two-man transporter.
Or whatever you people may be.
You might be squids, for all I know.
A two-squid transporter.
Room for one prisoner and one guard.
You want to tell us what happened to the guard, Mary?
I killed him.
But I was disturbed.
Then another came - a soldier.
He tried to shoot me.
Do whores have prayers?
So I plunged my new human hand into his chest and plucked out his heart.
And that's what you've been doing ever since.
This form needs to be fed.
All the punctures were all about the size of a fist.
My God, all those people.
You killed all those people.
I fled before any more soldiers came.
I had so much to explore!
And how I loved this body.
So soft.
So wicked.
The power such a body has in this world.
Within a few years the forest had gone, transporter was safely buried under the spread of the city.
I didn't care, I wasn't exactly in a hurry to get home.
And you've been killing ever since.
I knew there might come a time when my situation here became complicated, but I was safe, as long as I knew where the transporter was.
'The way she looks at you with those eyes - she's like an animal.'
'When they brought that girl into the hospital, I had only been qualified six months.
'I wanted to throw up.' And then the machine was uncovered.
As soon as the air touched its surface, I could feel it.
'She's just talking, she's not even frightened of us, she's just talking.'
So I found my Toshiko.
My beautiful Toshiko.
'Gonna go for it now.' Owen, NO!
Let her go, Mary!
Let her go!
Toshiko, tell them to give me the transporter.
I can't, Mary.
'It's ridiculous - we're unarmed, we're just shouting at her.
Not again.
Please, God, not again.'
'Knife has incisors on the blade.
It'll tear Tosh's throat out.'
How's this?
I'll exchange Toshiko for that one.
Your choice. 'No, no, not Gwen.'
Just put the knife down.
Did you hear him?
He didn't want to, did he?
'She read my thoughts, she actually read my thoughts.'
'What happened?
What did he say?
'
Please, don't...
That's what they think of you.
That's who you've been working with for all these years.
It's not true, Tosh, don't listen.
But not me.
Whatever I've done, it doesn't change the way I feel about you.
We have a connection, Toshiko, something real.
'Toshiko...
Don't move.
'Don't do anything until I say.'
OK, you want the transporter, we want Toshiko.
'I've been trained for this hostage situation...
'For God's sake, think!
'
I think that's a fair swap.
Keep the knife and I'll give you the transporter myself.
'He's just going to let her go.'
It's a bluff, but I think it's going to work.
You smell... different to them.
That's nothing.
It's when you compare teeth with a British guy, that's when it's really scary.
What are you?
I don't know.
And you would have put me in a cage?
What's happening?
Oh, that.
I re-programmed it for you.
It's set to enable.
Sort of now.
What did she...?
Has she gone home?
I reset the co-ordinates.
Where to?
To the centre of the sun.
It shouldn't be hot.
I mean, we sent her there at night and everything.
You killed her.
Yes.
Just ask her.
I will, but give me a bit of time.
Say something to her.
What do want me to do?
She's been through enough.
It's really creeping me out.
All right!
Owen, don't be selfish about this.
All right!
When did you have this...
I don't know...ability?
Just a couple of days.
What did you hear?
A lot of it was noise.
Emotions.
References I wouldn't understand.
Yeah, and the rest?
The rest was none of my business.
No.
It wasn't.
I don't know where this leaves us.
Me neither.
We can't really take the moral high ground over this.
This thing between me and Owen, it...
No, Gwen.
What I did was an invasion.
I wasn't in control, I realise that now.
But even so, I can't...
I have to live with this.
Not what I heard, but what I did to you.
And my betrayal?
What do you mean?
I'm living with mine.
This should be my wake-up call.
I should stop.
But I won't.
What does that say about me?
I'm not really in a position to make judgements.
This is what I'm saying, Tosh.
Neither am I.
Don't let this...
It doesn't matter.
Sorry, forget it.
What?
Don't let this put you off.
The last couple of days, you've had a look about you.
Love suited you.
It's funny.
Such a small thing.
It could be the most powerful piece of technology we've ever found.
It could tear down governments, wipe out armies.
What do we do with it?
Your call.
It's a curse.
Why couldn't I read your mind?
I don't know.
Though I could feel you scrabbling around in there.
I got nothing.
It's like you were...
I don't know...dead.
I want that list for UNIT on my desk tomorrow, or I'll...
What do bosses do in situations like these?
Y'know, regular bosses.
Can I get to beat people?
We've got rules for that!
Red tape.
Jack...
Something Mary said...
Probably the only honest thing she ever did say.
I asked her why she gave it to me.
And she said, "After a while it gets to you.
"It changes how you see people."
How can I live with it?
There are some things we're not supposed to know.
You got a snapshot - nothing more.
I don't mean about Gwen and Ianto and Owen.
I mean...
The whole world...
It doesn't matter.
Now these people are paying the price, ripped apart with your name written in their own blood.
It brings people back to life.
We just question the murder victims.
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
There's got to be a link between the victims.
Find the link, find the killer.
It's time Suzie came back.
We've been talking to the wrong corpse.

Where are you going, Goran?
- Goran, wait!
- You can't go...
I had read somewhere that Asians and American Indians lack some shit that dissolves alcohol in their blood and that they fall down when they taste liquor.
It goes to their legs.
And mine too.
What's the connection between them and me?
Goran Dujmovic, ancient Chinese name.
You need a ride, sir?
Drive, man.
Come on, hook up on me.
This is the only family I have in the world.
This one, with no arms, Miro...
And the trendy guy over there, Josip.
We've known Marko all our lives.
The bottom line is, we only drank at his place.
We didn't have much choice, in the hell hole with a couple of thousand people.
Miro moved in with me because that was the easiest way.
His house was mined during the war.
He wanted to clear the mines by himself and lost both arms.
It was easier for him to stay with me than with Josip.
Josip had a wife and two kids.
Miro said it was better for the kids not to grow up with a person with no arms, if they don't have to.
We lived off Miro's retirement and money from my late parents.
And we were running out of it.
In Germany they made prosthesis for people like Miro.
Josip said he would get the money for it and that it would make our lives much easier.
Miro didn't want to talk about it.
I hold yours in my hand more often than my own.
What's that written on your T-shirt?
Gaudi.
- My prick's like Audi.
Come on, shake it off.
Wash your hands.
Marija!
- Hey!
What's up?
Where's Josip?
I don't know.
He didn't come home last night.
Because of work, I guess.
He doesn't tell, I don't ask.
Miro heard that Josip likes other women more than his own.
Running around and making money won't matter in the end to him.
He'll lose his head over some pussy one day.
Everybody said it's so unfair that he's doing Marko's Sanja.
How can he look him in the eyes?
And pretend to be such pals...
I didn't like hearing stories like that.
What's up, faggots?
Are you getting some and why not?
Come up with something different because this is lame.
- OK.
What's that?
A bit of dried meat.
Look, bro, pure heaven...
Thanks.
Will there be some for me?
- And when wasn't there some for you?
Right.
I'll go and get changed.
Go home to your wife.
He's pretending not to hear me.
He brought dried meat.
It's good.
- Great!
Great.
None better than this.
His wife...
She doesn't even know hot to make scrambled eggs.
He says...
I brought some dried meat.
Sold and bought...
He's doing business, it's not that...
Kids grow up in a mobile phone.
Fuck'em, they're neither hungry nor thirsty.
They don't remember their dad.
As if we were hundred years old.
Fucking stupid people!
This guy is my hands.
What are you doing, fool...?
Let's eat this and then go fishing.
My old man kept telling me to follow Josip's example.
Josip earned his first money when he was 12.
He heard at the store they'll have Coke in a can the next day.
We didn't have that before.
In the morning he picked up Miro and me to help him carry it.
He bought all 200 cans.
He sold all of them before school and doubled his money.
Later a boy from 8th grade came to him to take his money.
Miro stabbed him in the stomach with a compass.
Josip never forgot that.
As long as can I remember, I never wanted to do anything.
If anything, I'd like to own a cafe.
Here they are, pal, here...
I'd have to stop drinking in that case though...
Then Miro would have to stop too.
Come on, hit me once...
- Don't!
Come on, hit me once...
- This one's not for it.
Cut the crap and hit me once.
Why isn't Josip with you?
Is that really a problem now?
I'm just asking...
It's OK, you just had to shit on my parade.
So, where's Josip?
Where's Josip, where's Josip...
I told Josip once that I'd like to own a cafe.
He told me to sell the house and that he'll double my money in 3 days so that I can buy another house and a cafe.
I could have sold the house, if anybody wanted it, except for neighbor Mijo.
Why do you need such a big house?
You got no woman, no child, no nothing.
My daughter is getting married.
I want my grand kids to grow up close to me and my old woman.
To run around there, on my meadow...
On your meadow, huh?
Sure.
You and your punks too...
You're always hanging around there...
Will you blow their footballs too?
Come on...
What are you talking about now...
I'm not saying I didn't, but...
Why do you remember that?
Wow!
Don't tell me they're all mine!
41 of them.
Well, my son...
A man is not a tree.
The devil has to come out somewhere.
Out of those 41 balls, 3 were mine, 2 Josip's and Miro's.
35 of them were Marko's.
I'd send Mijo to hell every time, Josip and Miro cut the tires on his car, and Marko just said, fuck it.
Where've you been all day, man?
At the hospital.
And what do they say, are you sane?
Yeah right.
Sanja's pregnant.
We'll have a baby.
Way to go, man!
Let me squeeze you as much as I can.
Good luck.
Come on...
You won't believe the hell we'll break lose tonight!
Don't be a redneck!
- Come on!
- Don't be yellow!
- Come on...
Red rose... she had.
She had... two pearls...
What's up?
- Sanja's pregnant.
Asshole will become a dad...
Fuck!
Come on, have a seat.
- I will.
Sanja, bring the cold cuts.
Is this one good?
- Please, not that one.
That one doesn't fit the mood...
What are you, a music editor?
I'm just saying...
- Just saying?
- What?
Come on, come on...
You have to try this one.
It's for special occasions.
For the baby.
To baby's health.
Where are you going?
Sit with us for a while.
Let me go.
Easy, Sanja, easy...
Come on, have some.
Tell us, Sanja...
Who should celebrate tonight, me or Josip?
I'm going...
- Sit down!
Sit.
Easy...
Cheers.
Why me, my friend?
Fuck it, we're human...
Shit.
We're shit, Josip.
Shit.
Yes.
We wouldn't be doing this if we were human.
You went around half the country every single day...
And you had to pick my wife.
I don't get it.
Do you love her?
Then what?
Wasn't there a better one to fuck?
Come on, don't...
Fuck, the whole town knows.
Marko...
If you knew everything, why didn't you tell me?
It wasn't my business.
You sit here every day...
You drink, you see me...
What was I supposed to do?
Draw it for you?
Marko...
Marko!
People don't know.
I, for one, didn't know a thing.
Don't let it get to you...
You wouldn't know if someone was riding your ass.
Joja...
Talk to the man.
There's no need.
You should have said something, Miro.
Should I bring more brandy, huh?
Is it a boy or a girl?
A man is not a tree.
The devil has to come out somewhere.
ALL FOR FREE
Dear friends, brothers and sisters.
We gathered here to hand over the bodies of our friends Miro and Josip to God and to see them off into eternity.
We thank God for the gifts of life, but we feel sorrow when we say goodbye to our beloved ones too early...
Marko turned himself to police.
But people kept saying all kinds of things.
That they chased him, that he shot at them and so on.
Only Sanja and I know what really happened.
You can lower the coffins.
If things were the way they should be, we would be burying Mijo now.
Marija must raise two children by herself.
Sanja will have a baby.
She'll also have some explaining to do.
I really don't have anybody now.
I'm left all alone.
Maybe I really wouldn't know if somebody was riding my ass, but I do know that this money is not mine.
I sold the house I inherited.
I never did anything by myself.
Why should I have anything then?
I don't know where I'm going, but it can't be worse than here.
Nobody will miss me here.
Do you have some medicine?
Isn't there anyone younger to take your place?
Younger?
Sure.
They roam around the world, pretending to be working.
They send me envelopes.
But empty ones.
For their pop to fill them up.
Fuck Norway and Sweden or wherever they are.
Your children, sir?
- Why are you so formal?
You saved my life.
Fara.
Goran.
My children, sure.
Two sons.
Here...
These are old photos?
Yeah, old ones.
I don't even like the sight of the new ones.
I'd been breaking my back for them all my life.
See this?
We built our house from it.
One floor for each of them.
Attic, basement, everything.
Fuck, how it went up in flames!
As if it was made of paper.
We put some money aside too.
I gave it all to them.
I sent them abroad...
So that they don't get picked up by the army and get killed.
All your life you do something...
You try...
But no use.
It's gonna be the way it's gonna be.
Take me for example.
Just as I was when I started, 50 years ago.
Nothing.
At all.
I thought there will be a day when I will put all four up...
And now I can't even retire.
Just look...
That's it.
I wish I knew what I know now.
One never gets enough pussy, drinks and money.
That's the way it is.
Fara, do you want to retire?
What?
Sell this to me.
Weren't you listening to me?
What'll you do with this, poor boy?
There's no money in it.
Screw the money.
Is that OK?
If you want to drive around in it a lot, better take it to Alija.
Who is Alija?
- God for automobile mechanics.
My old man taught me to drive a motorcycle, a car and a truck when I was 13.
He said, there, now you know everything I know.
I lost my health and earned my retirement behind the wheel.
If you want something better, you'll have to figure it out.
20 years passed since then and I haven't figured out much.
Come on...
Come on.
This one's not mine.
Good afternoon.
- Why are you cheating?
Not mine, not mine...
Fuck it all.
Good afternoon.
- OK, good afternoon.
I need some things.
I need so many things...
I'm a friend of Josip's.
- That changes everything.
- Liar!
Our dearest Tito's?
Aren't you Edvard by any chance?
- Josip who?
Jukic.
Joja...
He died for nothing.
What's the name of that kid...?
- Marko.
He killed his pal over his wife.
Pussy got the best of them.
Sit down.
Take Meho and me for example.
My brother killed...
- My father.
And then...
- My brother...
- Killed mine.
And?
Should Meho and I kill each other now?
I guess so.
Come here.
Come.
Come.
Take a pick.
Fuck you and your mother...
How's it going, Melalhudin?
- Poorly.
Some repairman you are, Meho.
Finished?
That's it.
- Wait a sec.
Wait...
This one's for you.
No need for it.
- Cut it out, you can't go around like that.
Do you need anything else?
- No.
Do you need soft drinks?
- No, I have enough.
Fuck...
Is it all legit?
Clean as a whistle.
- Really?
I wouldn't go around with that.
What?
- I said, it's not safe to...
- Go around with that.
Why are you shouting?
Did you fix the truck?
Nope.
Have you heard of Alija?
- Yes.
Take it to him.
- Yes.
- He'll fix it.
Do you need anything else?
- No.
- Come on, just say so.
Actually, there is one thing, but I don't know how to...
What?
Forget it.
Fuck, man, just say it!
All For Free I figured like this...
Wherever I go, I won't be the best cafe.
I have two tables and a radio.
For starters I figured,
I'll let them drink and enjoy themselves for free.
Nobody else does it.
Good morning!
Good morning.
Where are you going so early?
- Fishing.
- Fishing?
Isn't it too early?
What's for free?
- Everything.
And what is "for free"?
- Like, what does "for free" mean?
How come you don't know what "for free" means?
It means without charge.
You drink what and how much you want and you don't have to pay.
And where's the juice?
You want some juice?
We'll find some.
I put it a bit deeper so that it gets cooler.
I shouldn't drink too cold drinks, I'll get a sore throat.
You'll get a sore throat?
OK, we'll find some tepid...
Here, the same, but tepid.
I don't like that one.
- Which one do you like?
The white one.
- White?
What white one?
There's no white juice.
The milk's white.
There is white one.
This one?
No?
Maybe this one?
No?
Let me see...
This one?
This?
This one?
Then I guess I don't have the white one.
Do you want any other?
- I like only the white one.
Good afternoon.
May I help you?
Brandy.
OK.
Just tell me what kind.
Slivovitz.
- Slivovitz.
Smells good.
And the color is good.
- Home-made.
I guess everything here is home-made.
This one is really home-made.
OK...
I'll pay...
- You don't have to.
How come?
- This is not that type of joint.
And what type of joint is this?
It says clearly.
You're fucking with me?
- No, I'm just saying...
It says pussy on the fence too so...
You can't say it isn't until you've tried it.
What?
The fence, huh?
Come on, pour.
And this one is for free?
- All for free.
As long as I have drinks.
When I run out, I'm gone.
And how does it add up, man?
- Fuck it, I suck at algebra.
You really got me good...
Turn it off.
Turn it off!
You'll have to go to Alija.
Who's Alija?
- You've never heard of Alija?
I heard something...
- It's good that you can drive at all.
You can't do it without Alija.
What is this?
What do you mean?
- This.
Well, we're celebrating a bit.
And what are you celebrating?
You can't celebrate wherever and whenever you like.
You dragged these people here, huh?
- They came by themselves.
Get your things and go.
What is it?
Put that stick away before I stick it up your ass.
Move it!
He just has to shit on my parade.
What was that all about?
Nothing.
That's his brother-in-law.
It seems they don't like each other very much.
They're OK, it's just that Brko doesn't like police.
I won't stay anywhere more than one day.
One sees everything in a day.
Even more than it's necessary.
And I won't drink.
I promise.
This is, excuse my language, some kind of a fucking joke?
Are you really...?
Everything?
- Just like it says.
Well...
I'll have a beer.
- OK.
- Non-alcoholic.
Please, sit down.
- Thank you.
You're going to go bankrupt.
Fast.
And you had to calculate that?
You have to calculate everything.
And everything is calculable.
Look at this.
What is it?
My thesis.
Flip through it a bit.
And my clever teachers rejected it.
They said, hold on, colleague.
You can't do it this way.
One of them said, get serious!
It's the worst kind of envy.
And now they're running the country.
I tried at first...
I sent projects to the presidency...
But no use.
I finally gave up and said, you just do your thing...
Basically, fuck it.
Here's what that thesis said...
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a dying country.
There are three main reasons for it.
First, the economy survived the crisis in the late 80's, but the war destroyed it.
The agriculture is also completely destroyed.
6% of farm land is mined.
But the worst thing is that 5% of the population is old.
And it goes on to say...
Europe spends billions of euros on testing new drugs.
They should test them in Bosnia on senior citizens.
60% of the money to the people, 40% to the state and everybody's happy.
Good day.
Good day.
May I help you?
They're all saying, it can't be that everything's for free.
He must have poisoned everybody, they say.
Old man, go and check it out even if he did.
No harm done if you die.
You've lived your life.
Cunts.
They should have come here and smash everything.
And you too.
Why smash?
- Because you've poisoned everybody.
And now you're pretending to be giving things away for free.
I poisoned people?
- Yes!
You did!
You did!
- I didn't.
- Then do it.
Whom?
- Those idle cunts.
OK, old man, what'll you have?
Give me a shot of brandy.
How come you're giving things away for free?
I sold my house.
- Did you?
And you're the one who built it?
- No.
Then who?
Your dad?
And mom?
Yes.
They left it to me.
I didn't need it so I sold it.
They should have burned it down and not leave it to you.
What's wrong with you?
You just want to poison and set fire.
You bet!
They left everything to you and you squander it.
And everybody's applauding you.
Because you give them drinks.
What do you want?
To appear in the papers?
All the same people as the ones I left behind.
I never felt the urge to stay anywhere for one minute.
I don't know what I was thinking.
That I'll find Miro and Josip somewhere?
I miss them.
I miss everything.
Even holding Miro's dick while he's taking a piss.
I miss that too.
Good morning.
If it's good to you, I guess it's good to me too.
Nobody knows what's wrong.
They all fiddled with it...
- You just start the engine.
Let me hear what it has to say.
Put your foot on it!
More!
Turn it off!
Why is it farting like this?
I don't know.
They said you'd know.
Well, they were right.
Can you fix it?
Man, you can't polish a turd.
Have you been to Alija's?
- Yes.
And?
Not good.
Hello?
Hey!
Leave him be.
Why are you touching him?
I didn't do a thing...
- Just let him snore there.
How can I leave him here?
He'll get run over.
I wish I'd see that.
- What?
Nothing will happen to him.
He's an old oak.
Hundred Gods are protecting him.
I'll move him anyway.
Don't drag him over here!
He lives here, right?
When he finds the house, he does.
Well...
Throw him over on that side.
Why?
What's it to you, dear child?
You shouldn't care either way.
You'll be able to pass and I'm better off if he's over there.
Come on, take him.
Does he do this a lot?
Whenever he gets some money.
I just don't know where he got it from this time.
He must have borrowed it.
Tomorrow's the pay day and he'll give it back.
If he comes all the way here, why doesn't he sleep inside?
I won't let him in.
Why would I need him drunk like that?
He's really lucky.
- You bet.
You're not from around here?
No.
- What are you doing?
If you're thinking about making some money here, move along.
There's no luck here.
- I won't work here.
Some fool you are too.
How's it going, Ljubo?
- Easy.
- Thank God.
How's it going, boy?
- Neighbor, what'll it be?
Ljubo.
Nice to meet you.
Goran.
You've made this all up pretty well, Goran.
With a bit of improvisation...
My stomach's been killing me for seven days already.
Do you have something for it?
Yes, I have a bitter.
- Give me a shot.
Have something yourself.
No.
- Come on, cut the crap.
- No, thanks.
How did you come up with this jig?
Jig?
What jig?
You don't have to fool me.
We're in the same business.
No, I'm not gonna do this forever...
It's just a side thing for me.
My stomach's really screwing me.
It's really bugging me.
I've figured out what you're doing.
You're playing people...
You come here and give drinks for free to make them like you.
Later you'll come and open a real joint.
Isn't that right?
No, it's not like that.
- How come?
I'm not planning on opening a joint.
- Yeah, right.
Why are you doing all this?
For the fun of it.
For what?
- For the fun of it.
You're fucking with me, right?
For the fun of it?
Come here and let me tell you something.
I won't touch you tonight.
I don't want to make a scene.
But when I get up in the morning,
I don't want to see you or your trailer.
Is that clear?
What the fuck are you staring at?
Look, if you don't want a drink, go mind your own business.
People can't sit at your place without drinking either, right?
No problem.
Whatever you say, Goran.
I said what I had to say.
Close the shop.
Don't tell me you're scared?
What is it?
- Nothing.
I'm not scared of him.
You should be.
- Really?
Why?
He can be nasty.
Don't worry about me.
Somebody has to.
What's he to you?
Can I have something to drink?
What?
I don't have vodka with juice and crap like that.
Who says I want that?
Here you are.
Do you want something to drink?
I don't drink.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
Do you smoke?
I do.
Do you have a cigarette?
- Yes.
I don't want those.
I'm off.
- Wait, where are you going?
I see you don't want me here so I don't want to bother you.
You're not bothering me.
It's just that...
See you.
I kept away from drinking for seven days.
It wouldn't have been such a problem if I didn't stop in front of his cafe.
But I wouldn't have met her otherwise.
Hey!
Wake up.
I said I wouldn't stay at one place more than a day...
I didn't keep that promise.
Because of her.
Come on, wake up.
Don't come back anymore.
I don't like this either.
Let's go.
I don't know her name, but I'll find her some way.
Thank God that something nice happened to me too.
Here you are.
Are you satisfied?
- Thanks.
As always.
What?
- Do you need some help, pal?
Go home to your wife and kids.
Did you hear that?
Do I need some help?
Can I help you?
- I'd like a room.
Any kind, as long as it has a shower.
We're full.
Completely full?
Yes.
As you just saw.
Money's not the problem.
We're out of free rooms.
I'm telling you, money is not the problem here.
Maybe we can give him our room?
Here's our room.
Is that OK?
Come on, come on...
More, more...!
Stop!
What now, for fuck's sake?
Just tell us who it was and we'll fuck his mother.
Fuck'em.
- Whose foot did you step on?
Anyway, guys, do you have some flowers?
What?
- Some flowers.
What flowers?
How much?
- A shitload.
We'll pick it, no problem.
Meho, bring it over here.
Fuck the flowers...
Take it.
- I don't need it.
Don't screw with me, you need it.
Take it.
Don't you screw with me.
Put it away.
Fuck, you don't have to use it.
Just have it with you!
I won't, man.
Put it away.
Fuck, look at the state you're in.
And there are no more suits for you.
Hello?
!
Is anybody going to do some loading today?
This won't load itself.
I'll be damned if I ever saw a bigger jerk than him.
Damn right.
Some kids told me her name was Maja.
They also told me where she lived.
From the moment I saw her, I stopped thinking about myself.
Miro and Josip never once crossed my mind.
Have you been looking for this?
They fixed you up real good.
You should see what they look like.
These are yours, right?
You're a real jerk.
What's up, woman?
- What's up with you?
Nothing.
- Why did you come back?
Why did you leave your earring with me?
Huh?
Fuck you and your mother!
My wife is nagging.
She says I'm squandering what we have.
You're married?
- Yes.
I mean, I will be.
What is it?
Open up.
- I won't.
Come out.
- Nah.
What?
- I won't.
What do you want?
Why did you leave your earring with me?
Fuck you and the earring.
What is it?
Why are you screwing with me?
Fuck it, pal, you know how it is.
You have to know your way with the bitches.
If she feels that you're weak, she'll screw your ass.
She'll screw your mind.
And you know what else?
Never have just one woman.
You know?
It's unnatural.
Did you lose another earring?
Fuck you!
Fuck, hold it!
- Fuck you...
- Hold it!
Do you want some coffee?
This is...
- He was my husband-to-be.
The best man in the world.
Where is he?
He got killed, huh?
What?
Reminds you of someone?
Should he?
Ljubo's younger brother.
But he wasn't like Ljubo.
Sure.
- Cut the crap, you didn't know him!
How long are you gonna...
What?
You mean...
- You know what I mean.
You can't live your whole life like this.
I have so far.
I have what I need.
Ljubo gives me money.
What?
Ljubo gives you...?
- Yes.
Ljubo gives you...
And that's...
- I was his brother's fiancée.
- Cut it.
What the fuck are you saying?
Ljubo gives me...
What's that?
Ljubo is fucking me.
Say it.
Ljubo bought you.
Fuck...
You're real jerks.
You show me pictures...
- What do you want?
What do you want?
You're going around...
Giving everything for free.
What kind of life is that?
What is that?
And you have the nerve to preach about my life...
Who can you talk down to?
I'm stupid.
There.
I admit it.
I'm stupid.
I got it all wrong.
I couldn't do it by myself.
I went among the people.
I was looking for...
I was looking for...
You.
There.
I was looking for you.
And what do you need me for?
What do you mean?
Let's do something...
Let's live...
How?
How did you picture it?
Like, normal.
Like, normal?
What is that like?
Oh, early bird!
Come on, let's have a coffee.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Have a seat.
You've never had a coffee like this in your life.
I'd tell you the recipe, but I'm scared you'd spread it around.
Teaspoon...
She...
She can't live like this for the rest of her life.
I know, he's your brother and it's not easy to lose a sibling.
He's still her...
She still loves him the most.
And it'll stay that way.
Let her go, man.
Let her live.
Fuck, I can...
I can what I can, but...
This really makes no sense.
Try the coffee.
You won't have a better one.
Didn't I tell you not to come back?
Didn't I?
But it doesn't mean anything what other people tell you.
I don't get it, but we'll have this coffee in peace.
There are things you don't understand and you never will.
But...
- Shut the fuck up.
I'm speaking now.
Right there where you're sitting my brother used to sit.
We had coffee and lunch at this table.
In the morning, during the day and in the evening.
Look at me, you son of a bitch!
If I see you near her just once again,
I'll bury you alive.
Here comes our beauty!
Come on...
Have a seat.
I was just telling Goran he'll never have a better coffee.
We were talking and Goran said that you're dissatisfied...
Or did I misheard you?
Or misunderstood?
He's worried about you.
Do you need anything?
- No, I don't.
You're sure?
- Yes.
See, she doesn't need anything.
Thank God, that's settled then.
We wouldn't want to waste your time, you can go now...
Maja and I will finish this coffee.
Good luck.
I don't have any regrets.
I did everything right.
Even if I didn't, fuck it.
I didn't know any other way.
One can drink a house worth very quickly.
I could have crossed half the world, but why?
I doubt that somebody would have taught me to drink.
And I doubt anybody can tell me what that white juice is.
And I doubt that I'd see greater sorrow and beauty.
Now I'm breaking even.
And that's good.
What's more important, there's one thing I know.
I know she loves me.
There are days
When I don't know what to do...
Coz that song
Aches my heart
I love you
So much that I'm dying
I love you
But I don't know why
I love you
So much that I'm dying
I love you
But I don't know why
There are nights
When I don't know where to roam
All because of love
That aches my heart
I love you
So much that I'm dying
I love you
But I don't know why
I want to be a pilot.
My name is Omondi it means that when I was born
I woke up my mother early in the morning,
I am twelve years old
I live in Kibera the biggest slum in east Africa.
My last meal was on Sunday today is Wednesday.
I want to be a pilot
to fly very high far away from the ghetto
to a place where kids have parents that do not die of HIV every day,
to a place far away where guardians of orphans kids cannot abuse us every day,
to a place far away where I am treated as well as white people are.
I want to be a pilot to wear a uniform and fly very high
to a place far away where I don't need charity from distant lands,
to a place far away where white men cannot test medicines on us,
to a place far away where the leaders we elected
stop filling their pockets and start caring for us,
to a place far away where there are school books so one day
I can fly far away.
I want to be a pilot it must feel so good to go places where I can walk barefoot on the green grass,
where water is clean with rivers and springs,
where I can feel the sun shining on me.
I want to be a pilot
so I can fly very very high
to take off and land where my dreams are,
to a place far away
where God just loves me and churches are just the mountains
the trees the rivers.
Yes.
My dream is to fly far away to a place where my suffering can end.
I want to be a pilot
to wear a uniform to go places where others are not afraid to play with me because I am HIV positive,
where I can live a simple life,
where there is a future.
I want to be a pilot so I can fly to a place far away where my mom and dad are,
so they can hug me so they can kiss me so they can love me,
so I can hug them so I can kiss them so I can love them.
Thank you.

Christina, push the button and let the final ball exit the drum.
And the winning numbers are...
Gosh, I can hardly stand it.

Hello?
Heather?
Ryan, you're awake.
How come you're still here?
I slept in.
What's your brother doing here?
What's in the boxes?
I'm moving you out.
You're moving me out?
This is our apartment.
God.
My therapeutic life coach helped me to practice this.
Ryan, you're not motivated to awaken the warrior within.
I have aspirations beyond futons and IKEA Billy bookcases.
- I'm going places, thank you.
- I'll take you places.
Places?
A girl doesn't want to spend sunday at an auto market buying entry level sedans.
Heather do you really need your brother, the science experiment here, to help you out?
What's gonna happen?
I mean, am I nuts or something?
That might actually be interesting, Ryan.
Rory's helping me pack up your stuff.
Art supplies are in there.
I only ate 11 grams of fat last week.
Bet you can't say the same thing.
Ryan, we can talk about this later in the week, OK?
But it's not gonna work out, so just let it go.
Do you mind if I eat these bananas on the counter, dude?
Yeah, sure.
They're this new high fat bananas from Ecuador.
Ryan, we're leaving.
I wanted to remind you... that watching TV in the morning, is one of the first steps in a downward spiral failure that is becoming your life.
Asshole.
Ryan, we were doing a server maintenance and we discovered some files you've written.
- You read my personal files?
- Let me begin my poetry slam.
"Last night I jumped off Lions Gate Bridge and I drowned.
"But in the morning I came back to life and I crawled onto the shore, and back to the office,
"and started my job again and again and again..."
Next verse.
Oh, goody.
"Last night I shot myself in the head.
But in the morning I came back to life and I put myself together,
"and went back to the office to work in my cubicle.
Again and again and again."
You went into the system and read my poetry?
Even I don't read it.
Company property, Ryan.
Let me guess.
You don't like it here.
No, Linda, no.
It's not here I don't like.
It's more what we do.
And what is it we do then, Ryan?
Basically, we push electrons around with a stick.
Well... basically, Ryan, we'd like to suspend you.
And, if you'd like, we could pay for some counseling.
And if they say it's okie-dokie... then you can come back.
Wait.
Counseling? "They"?
You're serious?
Hello?
Come home... now!
- Mom, why?
What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong, it's just that...
We've just won the lottery.
4,3 million dollars, lump sum, tax free.
God damn it!
I know I left it somewhere!
- Wait, why is dad shouting?
- He's lost the ticket.
- Then how do we know we've won?
- Because...
Ryan, just come home right now.
Your brother's already on his way.
Oh, hey.
Feel free to pillage what you will.
I won't be needing any of it anymore.
4,3 million dollars.
Hey.
Oh, hi, dear.
Hi, mom.
Dad...
Dad!
Just explain to me the sequence of events.
4,3 million dollars!
I did what I always do.
I wrote the numbers down for easy reference, then I hid the ticket away for safe keeping.
Then what?
At about 10 this morning I was sitting right here reading the numbers on the paper...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
What were you doing here at 10 a.m.?
I got fired last week.
You got fired?
- Why didn't you phone me?
- Well...
I hated that goddamn job.
Good riddance.
Where is the bloody ticket!
?
Ryan, help us look for it, please.
Some big help you're being here, Ryan.
Hey, Kevin, I need this too.
I'm thinking.
Stop being a poet at a picnic.
Get off your butt and do your thinking that way.
Mr. Wonka?
I'd like a tour of your chocolate factory.
Somebody call the lottery.
What do you mean, they're not the winning numbers?
It happens sometimes.
You're sure you have the right date?
I am.
OK, Ryan, read those numbers back to me.
3, 8, 12, 13, 43, 50 and the bonus number is 27.
It's not the winning ticket.
Sorry, Ryan.
- What's this?
- Oh, crap.
What do you mean "oh, crap"?
Those are my ticket numbers.
I wrote these down last night when I was watching the draw... and then when I was reading the paper this morning...
I guess I got confused.
Hello?
Ryan?
It was a mistake here, Alan.
I'm really sorry.
Is everybody there OK?
Yeah, I think so.
I can't believe this day, man.
I got fired, I got dumped and... and now this.
You lost your job?
What did you do?
- I was a technical writer.
- Oh, you're a writer?
No kidding?
Oh, not really.
I...
- How old are you?
- 29.
Do you have any substance abuse problems?
What are you talking about?
No.
Then we have an opening right here.
Why don't you apply with us?
- The address is right on the ticket.
- So it is.
Your job interview is 10 a.m. thursday morning.
Be early.
Sorry, dad.
All aliens to the set, please.
All aliens to the set
- You're insane.
- It was an honest mistake.
Kevin...
- Mom, mom you need glasses
- Well maybe I do need glasses.
My dad says you're a loser.
He may be right.
I don't think you're a loser.
Thank you.
What do you want to be when you grow up, Wendy?
A trophy wife.
Hey, bro.
I hear Heather gave you the boot.
You know about that?
That happened this morning.
Rory's a steroid dealer at my gym.
He told me last week
- you were headed for the dump ship.
- And you didn't call me?
- Your love life isn't my business.
- I am a loser.
Man, stop worrying.
Your twenties suck.
Worst period of your life.
You're lonely...
You feel like your head's being blowtorched from the inside.
And we don't even know what it is because we were never even, like, taught the words to describe it.
So you feel like an idiot.
And a loser.
- Yeah.
- And... because everybody else is so young and beautiful you think they're having a great time.
But the fact of the matter is, dude, they are just as lonely and scared and fucked up as you are.
It's not just that, Spike, It's like...
It's like, one day you finally have a decent set of friends and then suddenly they all get exec jobs, get married, have kids and vanish, and your life is like that old science-fiction movie
Chalton Heston.
No people...
- "The Omega Man".
- Yeah.
It's like everyone's moved on and left you behind totally alone in this big, empty city.
Well... you might have a new job tomorrow.
Maybe you'll catch up to them.
Man, how depressing is that.
Seeing your life inside a box.
What is your problem?
I scored this great new place for you.
You'll love it.
Every unit is optic fiber wired, with soaker tubs, and a commune entertainment center with billiards and squash...
See?
I just aim money at problems and they go away.
You have the whole 25th floor to yourself.
Actually, you have the whole building to yourself.
It's a see-through.
A see-through?
Yeah.
Just like all the other buildings down here.
They're owned by Hong Kongers, but they're never coming here.
Since the merger with China went just great they bailed out of this things and drose.
Most of the apartments here don't have furniture or even light bulbs.
It's a resale nightmare for me.
Oh, by the way, you sort of have to be the caretaker of the building, too.
But, that's easy, cause, you know,
- nobody lives here.
- Right.
Our Nasty Condo Leaks sells at water damage and musky odors.
Hardigan's provides free analysis and a lifetime guarantee.
You can have a dry condo.
Now for your news on the hour, brought to you by with further involvement in the Quebec situation.
And locally, a large whale has beached itself below the Briar Street Bridge on Sunset beach.
You'll be seeing marine biologist on the scene are working out plans to move the carcass.
Police say an estimated 6 tons of the corpse would decompose naturally.
And in other news..
Oh, sorry.
Did I ruin your picture?
No, it's OK.
It's a digital camera.
I can take, like, a thousand pictures with this thing.
Actually, do you mind if I take a picture with you and the whale?
- OK.
Yeah, OK.
- Yeah?
OK.
- You hear about it on the radio?
- Yeah.
I never seen one before.
Here.
You look great.
Look at all these people.
What do you think they're all here for?
Same thing as us, I guess.
And what's that?
I think people wanna see something that proves life is bigger than we give it credit for.
You know, that there's more to the everyday world than just photocopiers, plug-in air fresheners and bulk grocery shopping.
That something huge can just happen out of the blue.
What do you think happened to him?
He looks kinda sad.
Like he was just a part of a family, and, sort of, fell away.
God, I...
I hope it wasn't pollution.
I mean, the ocean here is supposed to be clean.
Are you a photographer?
No, it's...
I just like to take pictures.
Are you?
No, I'm a... set dresser for the movies they shoot here in Vancouver.
Cable access and movies of the week.
My specialty is disguising Vancouver so it looks like an American city.
Right.
- Ming!
- Boyfriend alert.
It's a groovy car.
What does he do?
Is he, like, an astronaut?
No.
Brice designs golf courses.
I never thought of someone actually designing a golf course.
I guess someone has to.
What's your name?
Ryan.
Ming.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, Jesus!
Hi!
I'm...
I'm Ryan.
I'm here to see Alan.
I'm the writer
Alan?
Noam Chomsky is here.
You're hired.
Really?
Oh, yes, Ryan.
Just like that.
You got good Feng Shui.
I thought only buildings have Feng Shui.
Ryan, have you ever met anyone who actually had any idea what Feng Shui really is?
Not really.
And you're the only one who showed up for the job.
Now...
"Winner's magazine" is available for free at the checkout counters of most supermarkets.
And it provides the public with a coveted peak into the lives of the lucky few.
Wow.
Somebody actually writes these things?
Now, your new job has two parts.
Number one is interviewing the people who just won.
Now, that's gonna be kind of annoying for you because they just won... and, well, you didn't.
- Oh, you're a photographer?
- Well, no, no.
That's great.
Because, you know what?
People love to see a winner.
Now, the second part of your job, and you're gonna have to sign up for Mandarin language classes.
Well, sometimes you're gonna be manning the winners line.
You're gonna get a lot of Mandarin speaking calls.
Hey, Mandarin - the language of tomorrow.
Those numbers are correct, sir.
You just won 25000 dollars.
25000 dollars.
That's right, sir.
Now, legally, part of the deal with winning is, you gotta go public.
Have your name, photograph published.
Why is that?
Well, if we didn't, we could jut make up names of winners and never actually give out any prizes.
- Whoa.
- Yes, Ryan, whoa.
You see, for a lot of people, the dream of winning is the only thing that gets them through the week.
These are people that buy their tickets as soon as the last draw is over, just to keep their dream alive a little bit longer.
So...
How does it feel to win?
You just can't understand how good it feels.
No, I guess not.
Excuse me.
Yesterday, life was so average and boring... and now, today, is like a mystical experience.
It's like... life is somehow better.
More enriched.
But not by the money.
It just feels like, like we were chosen.
We feel like real winners.
All right, say cheese.
Cheese!
Hey, Alan?
Hey, kid, I'm fasting this week.
Do you wanna join me?
All the lemons and cayenne pepper you can eat.
- Sure.
Can I show you something first?
- Sure.
- I made this pie-chart, OK?
- You drew up this pie-chart?
- Yes.
- Nobody draws a pie-chart.
I've never seen a single person make an actual pie-chart, and I mean ever.
- Ever?
- Yeah.
OK.
So, most people peg the selection of their lottery numbers to family birthdays.
And that means that a disproportionate bulk of the numbers chosen are from 1 to 31.
Which means that the numbers 32 to 51, they're just not chosen nearly as much.
There's no data available on that, but I will concede your point.
I don't need data 'cause I went a step further.
See?
When the winning numbers are on the high side, when they're higher than 31, the winner wins all by himself and doesn't have to share.
When the winning numbers are on the low side winners end up having to share with other winners, just 'cause those number, they get used way more often.
- Right.
- Right?
Good.
Then my theory is proven.
And which theory is that?
That the real hardcore lottery ticket players are the ones that choose on the high side.
They want to win, and they want it all to themselves.
They don't want to share it with all the birthday people.
Excuse me while I wipe a manly tear from my cheek.
Ryan... you do me proud.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
"Birthday people".
That is just so great.
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, Ryan.
What's with the boxes?
How would you like to make 10 000 a month in your spare time selling quality products that everybody needs?
Oh, dear God, you're in an aloe products pyramid scam.
No, no this isn't a scam, son.
These are good products that really work.
Here.
Let me rub some on your elbows.
It's a little dry and flaky there.
- Oh, my God.
I'm hallucinating.
- Honey, look at Ryan's scalp.
If that's not seborrhea then I am not gonna be salesman of the month.
Dad, please don't look at my scalp.
I look at it enough as it is.
Ryan, if you get in on the ground floor there's no telling what you can achieve or how much you can make.
Dad, I can't sell aloe products, OK?
Besides' I have a real job now.
- Did I tell you that?
- I mean, this isn't real work?
Oh, it's not that.
It's...
It's just that...
Ryan?
Can you come and help me in the kitchen, please?
Sure.
Ryan, your father is driving me bonkers being at home all the time.
A man his age shouldn't have free time.
It only leads to tears.
He's been out of work for, what, 10 minutes, mom?
That's not the point.
He's already mooning and following me around like
I'm supposed to be his camp counselor or something.
He's turned into a cocker spaniel.
And I told him flat out.
I said: "I'm not gonna make you lunches and you cannot come shopping with me".
You have to make some ground rules.
Ryan, have you checked the pressure in your tires lately?
- They look awfully low.
- Dad, I'm 29.
You don't have to check the pressure in my tires.
Well, excuse me for being such a useless sack of shit.
Dad, that's not what I meant.
Good.
Very good, very good.
That is enough of this week's class.
Do your homework.
I see you this time next week for another one of career boosting Mandarin.
The language of tomorrow.
Hey, whale boy!
- Hey!
- Hi!
- Ryan, right?
- Yeah.
- Still taking pictures?
- Yes.
Did I see your boyfriend in class?
Mandarin?
Yeah.
He's taking it to help with his business.
And I brought granny here 'cause I thought she might be impressed.
Granny Chou, meet Ryan.
Hello.
Why'd she just swite me for?
Well, 'cause you're wearing a jersey with 44 on it.
You might as well wear a shirt that says death - death.
So, what should I wear, then?
How about a shirt with 88 on it?
"Prosperity - prosperity".
Well. my 88 shirt is out at the cleaners.
Ming, I'm trying here, but your granny is...
Who are you?
- Sorry, I'm...
Ryan
- This is Ryan.
He was at the whale.
Actually, for the first time ever, I'm having a housewarming, just as kind of a... a celebration of my new good fortune.
- Thanks, but no...
- Thanks, Ryan.
We'll be there
What was that for?
Who are all these people?
Well, you said invite everybody.
Excuse me.
Hey, who's the girl in the photo?
Ah, it's just some girl I met and thought she was really beautiful.
Kind of special.
- But she has a boyfriend.
- Yes.
How'd you know that?
Because, he's standing right next to her at the door.
A delightful housewarming, dear, but the building looks kind of minimally...
bleak.
Hi!
- You know, she's from that show.
- What show?
You know...
That show about all those kids who go to high school.
That could be practically any show.
She's in something.
It'll come to me.
- I need a drink.
Anything?
- No, thanks.
Nice piece of real estate you got here.
It is.
Thanks.
It's not mine.
I'm just kind of, like, the supper for the building.
Ah, so... you're actually enjoying the benefits of another man's property.
Come again?
Let's step over here for a minute.
So, tell me...
Ricky?
- Ryan.
- Ryan.
Tell me, Ryan...
What do you think of the view?
I think it's beautiful.
You don't think it's beautiful?
No, Ryan, I don't think it's beautiful.
All right.
What do you think, then?
Well...
I look out at each of those apartments out there... and each one of those apartments contains people who have something I want.
Or people who want something from me.
And each one of them will do whatever they can to take from me what they want.
Me?
I'll do whatever I can to cut them of at the pass.
Preemptive Darwinism.
All right.
What about the mountains?
Well, that's where people go run and hide when they find out I'm after their butt.
You really believe that crap?
That's not crap Ryan.
It's what I believe.
It's what Ming believes too.
I know you don't think so, but it is.
I mean, she's into all those artsy "discover yourself" lies, but that's all crap.
She sticks with me 'cause she knows that, in the end, I'm right.
What are you boys up to?
Ah, we're just enjoying the view.
Yeah.
Oh, God...
Doing your macho shtick again, aren't you?
Sorry Ryan.
I hear Spike's making tons of money in the milk bracket.
If the capitalist spirit lives longer, then you might strike the grounds, huh?
All right.
Nice condo.
Thank you.
It's actually not mine.
My brother...
Hey!
How are you?
Who would've guessed it Spike?
You just...
You've finally joined the middle class.
Middle class?
Come on.
You look at me and you think minivans, wife swapping and sheep dogs?
- I'm just doing what I gotta do.
- No, Spike.
Being middle class, it's... it's...
it's... it's almost a compliment.
I think it's a vanishing breed, you know?
Truly, it's entrepreneurial of you.
Entrepreneurial...
Jesus Christ.
I think this expansion is amazing.
Spike, I'm sorry, you created a business that you actually enjoy.
You've awaken the conquerer within, you tore down the wall of fear.
- Whatever.
- I feel like...
You're one of the few together people I know.
Dude, dude, stop talking.
This is the real expansion.
I am now one of Vancouver's biggest franchises and marijuana grow-ops.
So, there?
You still think I'm middle class?
Dude, the dairy business camouflages my power bills.
This moo?
Loses money.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
'Cause, dude, this is major.
It's on the need to know basis, and, now, it seemed you needed to know.
Well, I have to say, it's certanly far more in keeping with your character profile.
Thank you.
I've got franchises in 25 basements all across the city.
This plant here... female monster plants.
One plant gives 4 pounds, sells about for 10 grand, 20 plants - 200 K.
Best smoke in North America, my friend.
Tech stocks may have gotten wiped out, but bud is forever.
Well, you are indeed the master of your own universe.
Here's that car-pool story.
I've left the pictures with layout.
That's great.
This is just great.
You know, at this rate, you're gonna be junior editor in no time at all.
Two years after that you get sir Jender's job, another ten years you'll be a senior editor.
And then... you're gonna be nipping at this guy's heels.
Honestly it has taken me 20 years to get where I am today.
I think you can do it in 15.
You don't look so good.
Yeah.
Come on, Ming, we gotta jive.
I've got clients breathing down my neck.
So, you're a golf course designer?
How did my job ever come up, huh?
Don't be so paranoid.
He saw your corvette at the beach.
He asked if you're an astronaut.
Yeah, that's right, wise guy, I'm an astronaut.
What do you do that's so special, huh?
Nothing.
I work at the provincial lottery bureau.
What do you do there?
Let's go, Brice.
I interview people for "Winners magazine".
It' kind of a crap job.
Well, it kinda sounds interesting.
Doesn't beat space travel.
You should come golfing with me sometimes.
Me?
No, I...
I've never golfed before, ever.
Yeah, Ryan's not a golfer.
Won't make any difference.
...see if she likes it first, and then we can decide.
All right?
- Hello, Ryan.
- Ryan... hi.
What the fuck...?
Don't be such a prig about it.
Prig?
Dad...
You have a grow operation in your basement.
You could go to jail.
You're being so melodramatic.
Besides, we are growing some of the finest bud in the Pacific Northwest.
Bud?
- Well, what do you call it?
- I don't call it anything, dad.
Ryan... this is Whinonna.
She's our mother-plant.
All these plants are clones made from Whinonna's leaves.
We humans have blood, Whinonna has THC.
She's a real champion.
My parents have a grow-op in their basement.
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Beca...
Does Kevin know?
No, he doesn't.
And nobody likes a narc, dear.
I'm not gonna narc on you.
Did Spike set you up?
Yeah, aha.
Sure as business point of growing, each of Whinonna's clones are now roughly 10000 a piece.
Screw the aloe products.
And that's not the street price, dear.
That's the bulk price.
- Oh, yeah, the bulk price.
OK.
- Spike takes 50% of the gross, we get the other half.
Do the math, son.
He provides us with all the equipment and supplies, and in a couple of weeks, he comes and makes his call.
- He's what?
!
- Ryan...
Ryan...
Come and look at the buds on this one.
Her name is Angelina.
Your dad broke the 28.5% THC benchmark this week.
That is record.
He's like the Michelangelo of dope.
Spike, Spike...
These are...
They're my parents, OK?
They're my parents.
Why do you keep saying that?
Look... he's making way more then he did at that life sucking downtown job, and he's happy.
It sure beats 25 years of doing the same mundane crap, day in and day out for insulting pay, and, maybe, the occasional lateral promotion.
Right?
So, I'm not sure why I called.
You called because you sensed an opportunity.
- I told you I wasn't much of a golfer.
- Yeah, don't be too hard on yourself.
A better player might stay on the green a bit more than you do, but the fact is this place wasn't really designed with golfing in mind.
Yeah, you kind of lost me on that last one.
Well, let's just say you have a Consortium of Japanese entrepreneurs.
Yakuza...
Mafia?
And let's say that these entrepreneurs have... a whole bunch of money that isn't as clean as it could be.
So they open up a golf course which, on paper, rakes in a ton of cash, but nobody ever plays here.
- It's too hard on the old handicap.
- God... does anyone do anything real these days?
What do you mean?
It's just, everyone's in on a scam, or creating something nobody really needs to sell to people who are too stupid to care or notice.
What ever happened to just being real?
Why aren't we content to just be middle class?
Middle class?
It's cute, but unworkable.
Unless you're using middle class pictures to sell things to people who still think there's a middle class.
But, it's all just pictures.
I mean, the old suburbs we grew up in...
Sure, the kids were playing road hokey, and, sure, mom had 4 food groups on the table every night, but the parents were always fighting, and having tea parties, and the kids all ended up hooked up on drugs and addicted to PlayStation,
and nobody ever talked about anything real.
I mean, I don't miss it, man.
No way.
And now they're not sure if it's 4 food groups or 3.
It makes you think.
Tell me, Ryan, when somebody wins the lottery, what do they do?
Well... if it's an amount over 50 dollars they have to call us, and then they have to come in.
So you find out right away who won and who lost?
Yeah, sure.
I have a proposal to make to you.
I'm listening.
Don't sound so worried Ryan.
Nobody's gonna get swindled.
You just let my know who the winning ticket holders are, I'll buy the tickets off them with a 10% mark up, and, well, you'll make yourself a hefty finders fee.
Just think it over.
It's a win-win-win situation, Ryan.
It's just the most comfortable seating room I have in here.
It sat with the new curtains beautifully.
Of course, there was a time we would never have considered doing such a crazy thing.
I mean the old couch wasn't even 5 years old.
I guess what I'm saying, dear, is: who knew that being this happy could be so easy?
Ryan, man, thanks for taking over the win line.
This job is truly the work of the devil.
Yeah, no problem.
It's gonna be nice being back in the field again.
Like old times.
Good God, interviewing winners?
Are you a masochist?
Actually, Ryan, according to my therapist, I am a masochist.
But I'm almost ready to break through the wall.
I can upgrade from being a masochist to being a doormat.
Oh, there's herbal tea packets over there if you want.
Thanks.
?
Hello?
BC lottery bureau.
This is the win line.
Congratulations.
4 numbers, OK.
So, you have won...
BC lottery bureau, win line.
Well, congratulations.
How many numbers?
5 numbers.
OK.
BC lottery bureau, win line.
BC lottery bureau, win line.
OK, 5 numbers?
Yeah.
Well, congratulations to you.
Could you do me a favor and just tell me your address?
Congratulations.
How many numbers?
BC lottery bureau, win line.
BC lottery bureau, win line.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I can't really hear you very well.
Can you...
Yes.
I've got all the numbers!
You've won the Pick six?
With the bonus number?
Well, congratulation, that's a really big win.
What is your name?
Missus Horvat.
I've gotta talk to you.
OK.
Just give me 5 minutes.
Again, I just want to say congratulations to you.
Where might you be phoning from?
Brice?
Oh, God.
OK, here we go.
You got a pen?
What's up?
I'm... planning the... the office cruise.
- Wanna help?
- Are you crazy?
Summer office cruises are a disaster, Alan.
Really?
Why is that?
Because, everyone gets skunk drunk in the first 15 minutes, so, for the first half hour everybody's deluded into thinking that they're actually gonna have fun.
But then they realize that the boat's supposed to go to Bowen Island... but they're not even out of English Bay yet, and that they're trapped...
In a twilight-zone-like escape-free hell world.
An then the booze and the waves make them feel pukey and the food comes out, and the food's always bacon wrapped scallops in a film of oil and grease and chicken wings even the guy bars wouldn't use.
Plus, there's that scary Bunsen burner smell of the chemicals that heat the chafing trays.
And then the bad music starts.
And the music's always bad, Alan.
And it's too loud, and everybody just starts dancing and puking over the edge and the trip's not even a quarter over yet.
And then my favorite part.
The older men turn into perverts and the groping begins, and everyone's just sick and miserable and jealous of all the people they see on shore who are lucky enough to not be on a cruise.
And by the time they actually do reach shore again they're sick, hung over, they're numb from boredom and are most likely doomed to get a monster case of food poisoning at 4 a.m.
which will make them wish they were dead.
So, will you help me?
BC lottery bureau, win line.
- Hello?
- Hello there.
Listen, I just won a shitload of cash.
I would like it put into a Tweetey bird duffel bag and delivered to my condo by a quartet of strippers.
- Jesus, Brice, don't call me here.
- Why not?
- Did it work out?
- Yes, of course it worked out.
She sold me the winning ticket, no questions asked.
You see, the thing about people, Ryan, is that instant money always makes them greedier, so, in one simple transaction, a whole lot of questionable cash becomes a whole lot of legitimate lottery winnings.
- OK.
- No fuss, no muss.
- You're feeling a little?
- Yes, I'm a little?
Then relax, Ryan.
And, by the way, the official claimant on the Big Prize ticket is a Miss Kiko Hamada,
A plucky young Japanese student, in Canada to learn english.
Can you at least have miss Hamada to come in herself to claim the ticket?
We need to take a picture of the winner.
Will do.
You know, Ryan, for a guy with an envelope full of 20 grand, you could be having a lot more fun.
So, my suggestion is, go buy yourself a sensible, fuel efficient car, or whatever it is that gives you sense of joy, OK?
- Brice, I just want...
- Gotta go.
Can someone light me a cigarette?
- Hey.
- Hi.
Come on in.
I was surprised you called.
Yeah.
I thought you might want a copy of this.
Wow, thanks.
- I really like that shot.
- Yeah
- Actually, I like all your pictures.
- Oh, thank you.
You captured something really...
I don't know.
Beautiful?
I was gonna say hopeful.
But, thank you.
I really mean to put something together some day, like a portfolio.
Maybe take a long road trip and take a lot more pictures.
Do you want something to drink?
Sure.
I would love a water, if you have any.
Granny, look who's here.
Hi.
So, I'm bowing right now.
Is that the right thing to do?
It's a Japanese thing, but if it feels right, do it.
- So where's Brice?
- He's working.
Brice has much more on his plate then just golf courses.
You know, he's probably in some parking lot, stealing cars from new century yuppies.
That's a joke, right?
It's OK.
It's OK.
- Granny, it's just junk mail.
- OK.
Yeah, granny spends her days waiting for home invaders to smash down the door so she can knife them or gas them with tear spray.
Even her shit's as tough as nails.
- Wow, thanks for that.
- You're welcome for that.
So, are you not filming anything right now?
I have to make Vancouver look like Phoenix..
My hardest assignment ever.
Excuse the mess.
I just moved back in here with granny.
Brice doesn't like it, but... we'll se.
- Are you guys...
- I don't know yet.
- What'd she say?
- Granny says:
- nice bracelet.
More or less.
- Thank you.
And it didn't take you long to get the...
Mustang, is it?
Actually, Winners...
You'd be surprised.
The pay is not as bad as you'd think.
Come on, Ryan.
Brice told me about his new set up and what you're up to.
- He did?
- Don' worry about it.
You know, if anyone understands, it's me.
Hey, you want to take your new car for a spin?
OK, sure.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey, see that forest over there?
That was Oregon in an HBO children special this spring.
And see the general store right above it?
That was Northern California.
We called in the palm tree for that one.
- The palm tree?
- Yeah.
It's this 20 foot tall palm tree that spends his whole life being carried about the city whenever we need to dress something up as below the Oregon border line.
It's been in more TV movies than Jane Seymour.
It should have it's own star on Hollywood Boulevard.
My brother has a family and a nice house and stuff.
He must be doing something right.
Now, he's getting into this new... custom modified, web-delivered life enhancing product.
Penis enlargement spamming.
Remortgaging houses at 0% financing.
Right?
What?
What?
Nothing.
What did she say?
What?
She... said I should dump Brice and marry you.
- God, Ryan, I can hear you blushing.
- No, I just...
Brice does seem like a...
I don't know...
What?
Kind of a strange choice for you.
Yeah, well...
Asian women like to find non-Asian boyfriends because it's a way to escape the grip of our mighty, steal-fisted Chinese fathers.
- No, that's not what I meant.
- But, because we're human, we end up finding non-Asian guys who display domineering Asian-father traits.
But, I don't know.
Maybe enough is enough.
I guess that's why I'm back at granny's.
I mean I became a rebel because it was a way of telling dad "no more".
But then the rebel thing stuck, and now I'm over 30 and have a tattoo of a bulldog smoking a stodie on my lower back
and a wardrobe like leftovers from the cast of Rent.
You're over 30?
I accept your compliment.
I think it's time to go.
Yeah it's a made for HBO movie.
Pixel 66.
It's about bears with a mutated hanta virus who escape from the research facility and terrorize a happy seaside hablet.
Don't they all, kind of, just blend into one big movie after a while?
Hey, look!
Bye.
Thanks, Ryan That was the most fun I had... in a really long time.
Call again sometime.
BC lottery bureau, this is the winners line.
I think I've won.
- Congratulations.
How many...?
- I've got six numbers.
- You've got all six numbers?
- Yeah, I've got all the numbers.
- And the bonus number too?
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.
That's a big win. way to go, man.
- Hello?
- Hey, It's me.
- Me who?
- Who do you think?
I'm here to pick up my winnings.
This Mustang must be a great ride.
Oh, hi!
You're from... from the party, right?
The party?
Never mind.
I always wondered what it must be like...
Well...
Would you like to go for a drive?
No, I...
OK.
How about my place?
Hi.
Oh, hey, Ryan.
What's that?
Just a SlutCam website.
Marsha... what are you doing on a...
- slut cam.
- ...slut cam?
Oh, hi, Ryan.
Hi.
What are you doing on a bloody slut cam?
Don't be such a prude.
Like you've never handed down internet porn before.
That's not really the point, Marsha.
What are you doing on a slut cam?
I get free rent as long as I change my outfits 4 times a day.
Plus a percentage of the advertising revenue, which is for this, of course.
4 times a day?
- Does that include nights too?
- Yes, it does.
Have I been on the slut cam, Marsha?
Yes, yes.
And, what's the big deal?
Besides, my service provider says there's been a lot more hits in the bi-curious market because of you.
- They what?
!
- Ryan... do you really think I'd get to live in a cool place like this on a dental assistant salary?
What city do you live in?
Are you watching the screen right now?
- Yes, I am.
- Good.
Watch this.
I'm out of here, Alan.
Ryan?
Thanks.
Hey.
Hi.
That's weird.
Yeah?
I... thought you skipped town or...
- lost my number.
- Yeah, no.
I just...
Things have just been really busy.
Yeah, judging by that bruise on your neck, I would say busy in the best way.
You know.
Yeah, just...
My life's kind of taken some unexpected turns.
- So, work's been good?
- Yeah.
It's actually been really good.
It's all a bit bizarro right now.
Winning the lottery's been a real dream come true.
It's been like... oh, hell, like a ride on the?
My mother-in-law swooped in like a crow wanting us to pay for the cedar shingle reroofing on her shitbox in?
And my kids discovered they've got all these new friends.
And suddenly, they start using drugs, big-time.
Of course, I had to pay for all their new friends' drugs too.
Then they get kicked out of school.
My daughter moves in with my mother-in-law, finds God and gets pregnant, while my son gets caught stealing a Miata with two juvenile waste cases.
My wife's filed for divorce.
She wants the remains of the money, but, by now, there isn't too much money left to remain, you know what I mean?
The only good thing to come out of all of this is the Beamer in the driveway.
Gorgeous car. "Mein kleiner leiblich".
(my little sweetheart)
People can't handle money they didn't earn, you know.
They have meltdowns.
Families disintegrate.
And...
Thank you.
It's simplistic to say that big sum money invariably ruins the life of a winner but, you know, it does.
They go into debt, they get greedier for more and, sure, sometimes people manage to not have their lives ruined, but, like, instead of using the money to take time of and make art,
or contemplate the world, winners kind of...
I don't know.
They have acrylic murals of
Shania Twain painted on their living room walls and they buy these dopey cars.
Nice seeing you again, Ryan.
Say hi to Brice for me.
- What do you mean?
- Didn't he tell you?
I finally made the break.
So, I checked out Marsha's website man.
She's hooked up with some drummer now.
Guy's got a tattoo from his shoulder blades all the way down to his shins.
Sorry dude!
You're lucky, though, to be out of the relationship.
Just think of what would happen when your butt sagged.
It's not that.
You know what it is?
It's Ming.
Remember her?
I saw her again.
Oh, yeah?
So go for it.
I think I missed my chance with that one.
It's so hard meeting new people as you get older.
Everyone's already paired up.
Having kids
You're turning bitter.
What do you mean, turning bitter?
- Lay back, man.
It's nothing.
- I'm not bitter.
Just relax!
Dude, we are on The Grind.
World's longest vertical meat market.
Check it out.
Earth-muffin tree planters.
Strong backs from all that bending over.
3 Heather's from West Bend, looking for rich software nerds, way out of my league.
God, I love Vancouver.
So, bro?
What did you have to do to get all this money?
What are you talking about?
Ah, the car, the clothes...
I sell the name and address of the winning ticket holder to the Japanese mafia and they buy it from the winner for it's full worth, plus an additional processing fee.
You're working with Brice Kleinhart, aren't you?
You're like a sleaze magnet or something?
How do you always know these people?
OK there, señor Brady, I may know them, but you seem to get involved with them.
I don't care who I sell property to, but I don't invite them home for dinner.
By the way, I sold a few units in your building.
Oh, really?
It's about time.
Well, the communists were being mean to some capitalists in the southern province, and, wham, halfway accross the planet I get my face on the bus patch.
Hey, are mom and dad acting really weird lately?
Weird?
Clear!
Forward!
Freeze!
Don't move!
Oh, my.
Whinonna!
This is so role reversal-ish my head is spinning.
They didn't have to hold us all night.
The cops were just hassling us.
- We weren't doing any harm to society.
- I know.
Why don't they go after the real drug dealers.
The scuzbags pushing that China White.
You know, what you did was felony possession.
You can't ever go into the United States again.
You mean no more cross-border shopping trips to the Liz Clairborne factory outlet?
No, they just lie at the border.
As if they're gonna question a couple of old farts like us.
And I just bought that accurate digital scale.
Most we're gonna get is a 2000 dollar fine and a slap on the wrist.
We already saved enough to retire early.
- Hey, Ryan.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
- I... just wanted to stop by and say hi.
OK.
Come on in.
- And, an orange tree
- Yes.
- For me?
- Actually, no.
It's for your granny.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi!
- I thought it was kind of...
- A Chinese thing to do.
It's... yes a Chinese thing to do It's really cool, though.
It's got little baby oranges on it.
Can't beat that.
It makes you feel like a giant.
Here, put it somewhere.
Work still bizarre?
No!
It's a little freaky.
I'm not sure it's been such a good thing for me.
How are you?
Good, I guess.
Relived
I had enough of turning a blind eye and convincing myself I wasn't culpable.
It got pretty exhausting.
Well, Brice does, kind of, operate in a moral free zone.
What?
Like you're Mr. Inocent Guy?
- Meaning what?
- Meaning...
"Even though I helped Brice launder Japanese gang money with my..."
"ticket scam, I still have the right to judge others?"
Ryan, you're no better than anybody else.
Yes, but the...
It's true, Ryan.
You're corrupt.
It's OK.
It happens to everyone.
All right.
The ticket scam doesn't hurt anyone, though.
I don't even think it's illegal, you know.
I could get fired for it, but big woo, you know.
They would never go public with it, so...
Listen to yourself, Ryan.
You sound like me when I first met him, five years ago.
Ryan...
Granny wants to know if you'd like some tea.
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you.
Would you like to go for a ride after the tea?
Maybe get something to eat or something.
I'll go ask her.
It's just, I was, kind of, asking if you wanted to go, with me.
Are you asking me on a date?
Well...
I'm not gonna date you, Ryan.
It'd be like going backwards.
I don't want backwards.
I want change.
I'm not a corrupt person.
I'm just trying to get by, kind of thing.
You should probably go.
I gotta move all this movie junk into the basement before granny disowns me.
Hi, it's mom.
So, our court date's on friday.
Now, don't judge us dear Your dad and I are all jazzed about it.
Almost like an adventure we never had.
It's funny how we find out what makes us happy.
Oh, did your father tell you he's cooking again?
Gotta run.
The girl walker's just here.
Your dad made pork chops
BC lottery bureau.
Win line.
Yeah, hi.
Is this the middle class greed line?
I'm looking for the winner of the Pick Six who'd like to earn some fucking green in his spare time selling aloe products out of their garage.
Well, congratulations.
- 5 numbers?
Well, then you've won...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, Ryan,
I am waiting.
I'm out here, somewhere, and it's been a pretty terrible week.
So let's make this fast.
Hello?
- What, are you kidding me?
Don't you fuck around with me right now!
Hello?
!
No, no no...
I'm in no mood for fucking holding...
Well...
Just a heads up, I hope you got some kind of an acceptance speech planned, because the award for exemplary employee is first up.
Keeping us proud, big guy.
Keeping us proud.
All right.
Hello everybody.
Welcome to the twelfth annual boat cruise.
I'll be handing out the trophies for company achievements shortly.
Until then... please, enjoy the dancing, enjoy the scallops.
We've got plenty of time.
We're not going anywhere.
Hey.
Hi.
Freak thunderstorm?
A daring escape.
I think anything I said at this moment would most likely be wrong.
Well, at least you don't have to wonder if they're fake or not.
For the last few weeks,
I really thought I was Mr. Hot Shit.
Yeah, well, we all need to feel like hot shit at least once in our lives.
It's just that my once was dragging on for a few to many years.
I was getting tired of it.
Your hot shit threshold's a lot higher than mine.
I've never felt as bad in my life as I have these past few weeks.
When I left here yesterday...
I'm not gonna work for Brice anymore.
I'm finished.
I'm through scamming.
Really?
You told him yet?
He's getting the idea.
Ming...
I don't want to go backwards either.
I don't want any of it.
Not Brice, not Winners, not my brother's real restate schemes...
Well, what do you want?
He did not.
That cheesy sleazebag.
I know where he goes when he needs to figure things out.
Yeah, I think I know too.
Well, this, kind of, blows.
What the...
- Why'd you go slicing at me?
- I didn't slice it...
I am throwing it.
Brice...
Fuck off, OK?
No!
Giving you the names and addresses is sleazy.
It turned me into a sleazebag
- and I'm not gonna do it anymore.
- Are you dense or something?
Once you become a sleazebag, Ryan, you remain a sleazebag.
You don't just go and unsleazebag yourself because all of a sudden your conscience hurts you an itsy little bit.
- Are you stupid?
- Brice...
- just give him his car back.
- No, no.
No, no, no.
You take the car.
Here.
It'll start better.
I guess it wasn't fuel efficient enough for "I'm queer for kayaks" nature boy.
You know what?
Take this too.
This coat was made from cows who were kept in boarded pens so that the barb wire wouldn't scuffle the texture.
You should take it, it's cursed.
Am I a loser on a game show, getting consolation prizes, huh?
Are you serious?
You should really take it.
Otherwise, it's just gonna sit there and rot.
Guys!
Wait!
Guys!
Stop!
This is ridiculous!
Stop it
Stop it.!
Brice?
Shit...
Brice?
Stop!
Look, look!
- Oh, shit.
- What are they doing here?
Oh, shit.
Ming...
They're here because I haven't been making good on my promises.
And now this number pin bill is the last straw.
Now I'm left holding a bag full of dead cats.
What?
I just thought it sounded cool and chinese.
Oh, man...
- This is where I duck out.
- I think so.
You have no idea where we're going, do you?
Does it matter?
What a beautiful day.
Really?
I was gonna say hopeful.
Hope you enjoyed the movie and the subs!

I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's goin'on.
I hate you.
[Chuckles]
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
- [Typing]
- And then there are the verbal threats.
[Man] He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining'this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
-No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here- [Reading Spanish]
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy. "
As ifhe was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
[Chuckles] Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
[Man Over Radio] Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.

-Here comes the Secret Service.
-I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing,
I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
- Rosario.
- [Speaking Spanish]
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?

Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
Aprotective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
[Knocking]
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
[Chattering]
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
- [Radio Beeps]
- Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. Thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
-Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
[Voices Chattering Over Radios]
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is.!
Publishers Clearing House, my man.!
You got somethin'for me?
[Laughs] Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
[Man Over Radio, Indistinct]
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
[Camera Zoom Whirring, Shutter Clicking]
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys.!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q' clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q' clearance.
[Ballentine] Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
[Man] I will blow you up.
I come to bomb this country.
[Indistinct] Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
- Yeah.
- [Coins Jingling]
This.
[Ballentine] And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
[Siren Blares]
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
[Woman Over Radio] Copy that.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
[People Chattering]
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. Of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
[Envelope Rustling]
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half'?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p. m.
This afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- [Woman] Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
[Man] Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to killJohn?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence forJohn, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
[All] No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
- You look worse.
- [Chuckles]
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- [Woman] Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
- [Camera Shutter Clicks]
- Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you. - [Man] Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.

-What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
[Car Engines Start]
Pete.!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
- Short.
- [Teddy] You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- [Xavier] Do you got the money?
- [Pete] I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
[Xavier Chuckles] Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a. m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.

Pete!
- [People Chattering] - [Man Over Radio, Indistinct]
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
[Carl] Pete.!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
[Woman Over TV] This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
[Man Over TV] Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
[Man Over TV] We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One...
- [Speaking Foreign Language]
Went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe. - [Foreign Language]
[Woman] If you arejustjoining us, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- [Man] I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
[Dial Tone Humming]
[Man] Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
- Has not been confirmed by investigators.
- [Knocking]
- Again, these pictures coming to us about- - [Shuts TVOff]
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
- [Door Opens]
- Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
[Breckinridge] You screwed up, Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 am every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The-
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed.!
Goddamn it.!
Just think about it.
- You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
- [Whistles]
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
[Sighs]
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
- [Gasping]
- Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin'at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
[Man] Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
[Voices Chattering Over Radios]
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Yeah?
[Woman Over Radio] Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
[Man Over Radio] Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
[Car Alarm Wailing]
[Both Laughing]
[Man Over Radio] Backstop, go.
[DiPaola] Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
[Chattering]
[Man] He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
- [Man #2] That's not funny, man.
- [Laughing]
- [Man #2] Thatjoke ain't funny at all.
- [Phone Ringing]
- [Man Over Radio] Fullback.
We're movin'
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do.
I'll go toJohn.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
[Moans]
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. Area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
[Car Alarm Beeping]
[People Chattering]
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.

Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
[Beeps]
[Phone Dialing]
[Writing]
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
-And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.

[Barking]
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
[Creaking]
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
-Don't make me do this
- No way.!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave.!
My buddy.!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
[Panting]
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
-G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
[Gasps]
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
[No Audible Dialogue]
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
[Dogs Barking]
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no.
No.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- [Gunfire Continues]
- Shooting.
Shooting.
- [Russian] Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
[Bottles Clattering On Floor]
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
- [Knocking]
- Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Oh!
[Line Ringing]
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
[Dialing]
[Computerized Voice] One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing myjob.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
- Rip this place apart.
Find me something now. - [Cell Phone Ringing]
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- [Sarah] Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
[Sarah] Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
[Hand Dryer Blowing]
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
[Voices Chattering Over Radios]
[Man Over Radio] Sweeps two and three now complete.
[Bell Ringing]
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take to check them against the F.B.I. And C.I.A. Databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
[Sighs]
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
[Montrose] You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.

Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100%% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
[Crowd Applauding]
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.

[Woman Over Radio] Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus.!
I got Garrison through the three.
[Ballentine] This resolution cannot function alone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
[Whispering]
[Man Over Radio] No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
[Static Blaring Over All Radios]
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
[Ballentine] But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- [Breckinridge] Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- [Woman] You are a Do Not Admit.!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- [Breckinridge] Listen to me.!
Do not let him move the president.!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
[Chattering]
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
[Woman] We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
[Gasps]
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
[Hassad] Pete, we're cut off from the "B"motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you- How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
[Montrose] Pete.
Pete.
My family.

Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!

Let's go get 'em.!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.

Let's get him in.!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.

Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

Listen, Pete, um-
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.

Do well, guys.

All the best.

You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.

Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.

I hate yöu.
I saw yöu on the news.
I got yöur message.
I know yöu want me to kill yöu.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then there are the verbal threats.
He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining' this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did yöu translate this?
- No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do yöu know that?
Well, he translated here-
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy. "
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think yöu have a little spinach or something in yöur teeth.
I want yöu to route all calls through to my cell.
yöu picked a hell of a day to start yöur field work.
- Button up yöur jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- yöu guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- yöu think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
yöu know my problem with gut feelings?
Once yöu have them, the only evidence yöu see... is the evidence that reinforces yöur gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
yöu have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from yöur initial canvassing, I bet yöu no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell yöu that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
Rosario.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
yöu sure?
yöu've been on as long as me.
yöu gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are yöu sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't yöu explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because yöur academy trains yöu... to draw yöur weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if yöu have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yöurs, yöu would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough yöu are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully yöu sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
yöu all right?
I missed yöu.
I missed yöu so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There yöu go.
And enjoy.
I love yöu, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are yöu?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are yöu?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are yöu doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was yöur friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell yöu why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for yöu... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- yöu got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw yöu.
- What?
- Screw yöu.
- yöu still got a problem with me?
- Take yöur hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to yöu.
I don't care if yöu got a problem with me... but yöu show respect when yöu come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If yöu have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine. yöu're a piece of work.
yöu know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
yöu have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if yöu figure it out, yöu know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send yöu a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- yöu workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep yöur eyes open.
yöu may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between yöu two?
- I thought yöu were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know yöu weren't.
What do yöu want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
yöu still love him, don't yöu?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
yöu know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him yöu weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said yöu're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
yöu got somethin' for me?
Did yöu fill yöurs out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
yöu got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, yöu know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if yöu got somebody inside.
yöu saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving yöu the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are yöu smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell yöu this stuff, yöu roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put yöu in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, yöu got a traitor in yöur organization.
- yöu get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with yöu.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change yöur mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yöurs.
What do yöu think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
yöu can have anybody yöu want.
From I.D., from the field.
yöu get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel yöu need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
I will blow yöu up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
yöu think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of yöur teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what yöu have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do yöu think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
yöu all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, yöu're the guy.
yöu're the last line of defense.
yöu can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that yöu can think of that'll help yöu do that?
Yeah.
This.
And I promise yöu, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
yöu can bank on it.
Thank yöu very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank yöu.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank yöu, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copy that.
Command to alpha cars. yöu are off the hook.
Sir, could yöu put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, yöung lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are yöu sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- yöu ever tried?
- What?
- Have yöu ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
yöu better be right.
yöu get in touch with us as soon as yöu find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes yöu a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of yöur people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p. m. this afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were yöu born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do yöu live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were yöu born in Alabama?
- No.
Have yöu ever had contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are yöu up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get yöur polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were yöu divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have yöu received adequate training for yöur profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have yöu ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have yöu done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are yöu involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- yöu look exhausted, Bill.
yöu look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have yöu done yöur polygraph yet?
- yöu know I can't even let yöu back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is yöur name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are yöu involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were yöu divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have yöu violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have yöu done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
Mayflower Hotel, can I help yöu?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are yöu Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
yöu have a phone call.
yöu can take it here.
- Thank yöu.
- Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express... with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were yöu doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of yöur agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have yöu been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were yöu?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is yöur weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to yöu a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's yöur informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see yöu at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for yöu to weigh in.
- Can I get yöu in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If yöu could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called yöu?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called yöu?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would yöu care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was yöur flight?
- Short.
- yöu guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
yöur informant's on the phone.
- Do yöu got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing yöu the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed yöu in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a. m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, yöu heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let yöu go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with yöu.
- Let's go.
At yöur 1:00.
Watch yöur 3:00.
Watch yöur 3:00.
Check yöur 9:00.
Check yöur 9:00!
Check yöur 9:00!
Check yöur 9:00!
Get down!
Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to Command.
We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command, copy that.
Available units en route.
E. T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of yöu.
Unholster yöur weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work yöur way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
yöu okay?
Do yöu have any idea why yöur informant wanted to have yöu killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
yöu might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If yöu're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One... went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
If yöu are just joining us, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- yöu failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do yöu understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about-
Well, it sure doesn't look like yöu're here to bury the hatchet.
yöu're being investigated for treason.
- What are yöu talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long yöu been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are yöu talking about?
Hugo, can yöu come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were yöu doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes yöu four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called yöu four times.
yöu never returned any of his messages.
And that yöu almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are yöu doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
yöu screwed up, Pete.
yöu walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know yöur number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how yöu were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with yöu, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a. m. every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
yöu're bitter after all yöur years of service that they didn't make yöu director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse yöur own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, yöu took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, yöu haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know yöu wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that yöur professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got yöu nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- yöu can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
yöu can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, yöu better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
yöu think I wrecked yöur marriage, and it has completely clouded yöur judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
yöu had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The- - yöur signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not yöur signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
yöu initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... yöu'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
yöu take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
yöu better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are yöu doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got yöur gun?
And yöur radio?
What the hell are yöu lookin' at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have yöu been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of yöu he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of yöu.
yöu've never trained for this.
yöu are chasing yöur worst nightmare.
He knows how yöu think.
He knows what yöu know.
And he knows how yöu operate.
And he will use that against yöu.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for yöu... to pull the trigger if yöu have him in yöur sights.
So I want yöu to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Yeah?
Fullback, Backstop.
Do yöu have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do yöu know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"yöu didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
- That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're movin'.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See yöu later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank yöu.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to yöu.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are yöu doing here?
I heard yöu were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever yöu hear about me in the next few days, I want yöu to know I was framed.
- I had to tell yöu to yöur face.
- No, yöu don't.
No, yöu don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control. yöu've got to turn yöurself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, yöu do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let yöu do that.
Pete, they think yöu're an assassin.
They will kill yöu.
- yöu can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
yöu turned around when it rang, didn't yöu?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is yöur post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want yöu to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want yöu to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do yöu know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help yöu?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And yöu must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would yöu have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if yöu do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank yöu, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And yöu know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran yöur field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell yöu, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do yöu copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get yöur men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect yöu.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
yöu want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
yöu really think it's him, don't yöu?
- Pete, yöu scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to yöur car, and I want yöu to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do yöu want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do yöu want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no. no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
yöur name?
yöur name!
Who sent yöu?
Who sent yöu!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think yöu should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but yöu're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are yöu talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear yöu.
Dave, I don't know what to tell yöu.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe yöu could take a look at that if yöu get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see yöu tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want yöu to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love yöu.
I want yöu to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer yöu a drink?
- No, thank yöu, ma'am.
yöu know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for yöu.
yöu know, I don't know all the evidence yöu have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank yöu.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that yöu can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank yöu very much.
See yöu in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if yöu want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for yöu.
I'm sure they are.
- Did yöu find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did. yöu gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to yöu, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. and C.I.A. databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call yöu five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank yöu.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do yöu think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know yöu're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
yöu really are an idiot, yöu know that?
- yöu honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank yöu.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
yöurs was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
yöu know I never guaranteed yöu success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to yöu, William.
I mean, if yöu wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, yöu could have put him there.
Now, yöu've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- yöu did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do yöu want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like yöu agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if yöu kill me.
- Here yöu go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank yöu.
William... if yöu don't do this, we're not gonna kill yöu.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
yöu do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, yöu take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and yöu take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
yöu can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want yöu to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what yöu got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- yöu're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were yöu thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Be advised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
This resolution cannot function alone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster yöur weapons.
Holster yöur weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding yöur orders!
- yöu don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell yöu that Montrose is the mole.
But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
Get yöur hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- yöu are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need yöur help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete, we're cut off from the "B" motorcade.
yöu okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off yöur locator.
What?
yöur locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do yöu- How do yöu know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, yöu're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get yöu up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high. yöu go low. yöu ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover yöu from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as yöu can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to yöu, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get yöu out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, yöu're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um-
yöu take care of yöurself.
I'll save yöu a tee time.
Tom, yöu did a great job.
I was proud to work with yöu.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see yöu guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See yöu soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
yöu gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something yöu want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See yöu around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss yöu too.
Take care.

As a matter of fact, there is.
If you want a career here in P.I.D., you might want to... invest in some more appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on.
That's why I'm here.

You're not a very good liar, Pete.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
I
- I really want to know.
9.5.
Excuse me.
Charlie?
Charlie.
Charlie!
Oh, my God.
Charlie.
Somebody!
Help!
Charlie.
Charlie.
Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's goin' on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then there are the verbal threats.
He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining' this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
- No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here-
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy. "
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
Rosario.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got somethin' for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
I will blow you up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah.
This.
And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copy that.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p. m. this afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express... with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
- Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a. m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down!
Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to Command.
We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command, copy that.
Available units en route.
E. T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One... went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
If you are just joining us, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about-
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
You screwed up, Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a. m. every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The-
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin' at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Yeah?
Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
- That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're movin'.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no. no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. and C.I.A. databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Be advised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
This resolution cannot function alone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- You are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete, we're cut off from the "B" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you- How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high.
You go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um-
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.

Everything's good.

Matt's getting closer with Ben-Itzak on the EastJerusalem proposal... but it's gonna take your visit to get him to agree.
- What about Abu Jallal?
- If we can work out the water issues, he'll support it.
But again, we're not gonna get any firm commitments until they have face time on Friday.
I'll be there.
I'm just not gonna hang around, 'cause it loses its effectiveness.

Any other supportive advice before we get to know each other?
As a matter of fact, there is.
If you want a career here in P.I.D., you might want to... invest in some more appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on.
That's why I'm here.
You requested me as a T.A. Why?

I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's goin'on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
- And then there are the verbal threats.
He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining'this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
- No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here...
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
As ifhe was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him... yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a.45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
- Rosario.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
- You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm... the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
Aprotective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line...
Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or...
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He...
He was murdered?
P.I.D. Thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just...
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got somethin'for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who...
Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
Lfind it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important...
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
I will blow you up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
- Yeah.
This.
And I promise you, right here and now, We're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copy that.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. Of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. This afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau...
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to killJohn?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence forJohn, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
- You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless...
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
- Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12: 13 Acela Express... with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
- F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or...
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
- Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down!
Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to Command.
We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command, copy that.
Available units en route.
E.T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not...
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded...
We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you'rejustjoining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One... went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
If you are just joining us, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a...
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
- Has not been confirmed by investigators.
- Again, these pictures coming to us about...
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk...
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
- Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
You screwed up, Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m. Every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The...
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
- You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really...
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
- Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin'at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
- Yeah?
Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're movin'.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do.
I'll go toJohn.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. Area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
- Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no.
No.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
- Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
- Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm...
I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing myjob.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
- Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee...
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. And C.I.A. Databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
- Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations...
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her...
only her... that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Be advised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through...
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
This resolution cannot function alone.
It is designed...
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
- Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- You are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time...
- Mr. President.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete, we're cut off from the "B" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you...
How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was...
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high.
You go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um...
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
- This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.

As a matter of fact, there is.
If you want a career here in P.I.D., you might want to... invest in some more appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on.
That's why I'm here.

Excuse me.
Excuse me.

Hi, sir.
Could we see your hands, please?

I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's goin' on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then there are the verbal threats.
He'sa deadman.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining' this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
- No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here-
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.

Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a.45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
Rosario.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got somethin' for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
Iwillblowyou up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah.
This.
AndI promiseyou, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copythat.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. this afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Haveyoueverhad contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express... with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
- Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down!
Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to Command.
We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command,copythat.
Available units en route.
E. T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
We'renowhearingreports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One... went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
Ifyouarejustjoiningus, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about-
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
Youscrewedup ,Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m. every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The-
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin' at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Yeah?
Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
- That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're movin'.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no. no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. and C.I.A. databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Beadvised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Beadvised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
Thisresolution cannot function alone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
Nounauthorizedpersonnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
ButI stronglybelieve that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- You are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete,we'recutoff from the "B" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you- How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high.
You go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um-
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.

Excuse me.

Charlie!
Oh, my God.
Charlie.
Somebody!
Help!
Charlie.
Charlie.
Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's goin' on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then there are the verbal threats.
He'sa deadman.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining' this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
- No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here-
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a.45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.

Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got somethin' for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
Iwillblowyou up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah.
This.
AndI promiseyou, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copythat.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. this afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Haveyoueverhad contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express... with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
- Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down!
Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to Command.
We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command,copythat.
Available units en route.
E. T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
We'renowhearingreports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One... went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
Ifyouarejustjoiningus, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about-
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
Youscrewedup ,Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m. every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The-
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin' at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Yeah?
Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
- That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're movin'.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no. no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. and C.I.A. databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Beadvised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Beadvised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
Thisresolution cannot function alone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
Nounauthorizedpersonnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
ButI stronglybelieve that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- You are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete,we'recutoff from the "B" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you- How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high.
You go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um-
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.

But again, we're not gonna get any firm commitments until they have face time on Friday.
I'll be there.
I'm just not gonna hang around, 'cause it loses its effectiveness.

Sorry.

Well, aren't you the recruiting poster.
Résumés don't mean a lot to me, and they mean absolutely nothing on the street.
Any other supportive advice before we get to know each other?
As a matter of fact, there is.
If you want a career here in P.I.D., you might want to... invest in some more appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on.
That's why I'm here.
You requested me as a T.A. Why?
My field instructor at the Academy said you're the best investigator we have.
- Who is that?
- Pete Garrison.

- All right.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hi, sir.
Could we see your hands, please?
- Huh?
What are-
- Take your hands out of the jacket.

How do you think it went in there?
- Excuse me, ma'am, are you talking to me?
- Yes.
I thought it was, uh, an excellent speech.
- One to 10?
- Ten, ma'am.
You're not a very good liar, Pete.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
I
- I really want to know.
9.5.
Excuse me.
Charlie?
Charlie.
Charlie!
Oh, my God.
Charlie.
Somebody!
Help!
Charlie.
Charlie.
Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's goin' on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then there are the verbal threats.
He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining' this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
- No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here-
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy. "
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
Rosario.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got somethin' for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
I will blow you up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah.
This.
And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copy that.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p. m. this afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express... with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
- Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a. m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down!
Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to Command.
We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command, copy that.
Available units en route.
E. T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One... went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
If you are just joining us, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about-
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
You screwed up, Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a. m. every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The-
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin' at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Yeah?
Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
- That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're movin'.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no. no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. and C.I.A. databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Be advised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
This resolution cannot function alone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- You are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete, we're cut off from the "B" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you- How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high.
You go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um-
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.

Detroit beat New Orleans, a closer game, 28-20, as the start of the new season quickly approaches.
We saw Philadelphia absolutely crush Washington last night.

By the way, you made 'Time'.
It's very fancy.
Ooh, I look good.

What's happening at Camp David?
Well, Matt's getting closer with Ben-Itzak on the East Jerusalem proposal, but it's gonna take your visit to get him to agree.
All right.
What about Abu Jallal?
If we can work out the water issues, yes, he'll support it.
But again, you know, we're not gonna get any firm commitments
- until they have face time on Friday.
- Well, I'll be there.
I'm just not gonna hang around, 'cause it just loses its effectiveness.
- No, I understand, sir.
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Yes.
- Thank you, Sue.
Good morning.

Any other supportive advice before we get to know each other?
As a matter of fact, there is.
If you want a career here in PID, you might want to invest in some more appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on.
That's why I'm here.
You requested me as a TA.
Why?
My field instructor at the Academy said you're the best investigator we have.

How do you think it went in there?
- Excuse me, ma'am, are you talking to me?
- Yes.
I thought it was an excellent speech.
- 1 to 10?
- 10, ma'am.
You're not a very good liar, Pete.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
I really want to know.
9.5.
Excuse me.
Charlie?
Charlie!
Charlie!
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
Somebody!
Help!
Charlie.
Charlie.
Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's going on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.
Sorry.
- So, all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then... there are the verbal threats.
He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
No.
- But whoever did, is not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here...
And that literally means, "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing down my neck.
What the hell do they know about investigating murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge and Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet, and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger, to notice anything outside of the ordinary.
So for some average street criminal to get the drop on him, yeah, it raises some questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
- Rosario.
- Hola, Mrs. Sarah.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- No, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, why don't you sweep downstairs and go for dinner?
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
- You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
- You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, if you take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb, you'll see the slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
So what are you saying?
Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet, and stopped it from penetrating the wood, which it easily would have done, had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm...
The safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
Well, if he was a police officer, it would make sense, because your academy trains you to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line, Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care, if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit!
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or...
Aziz, what are you doing here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He...
He was murdered?
PID thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
Did he tell you why?
He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip...
It's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you, but I need a complete picture, if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip...
It just...
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ!
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me, but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have any information that can help me with the case, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Okay, fine.
You're a piece of work, you know that?
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey!
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You working with him now?
- Yeah.
All right.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
Especially about me.
Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
No.
You know what?
He can go to hell.
- I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- Tell him again that it wasn't--
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
I'm just saying--
- I wasn't having an affair!
Cindy, I know you weren't.
I would just--
What do you want me to tell him that I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete!
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore, offered to transfer the call to WFO, PID...
He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got something for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
- Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
- Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- Was that that agent who was killed last night outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
What are you saying?
There's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
I mean who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down for the rest of my life.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is, they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house, 20 minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve to take on the infrastructure of terrorism, wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir, that's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Polygraph everyone on that list, and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this, so let's fold that investigation in as well.
And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- You think he's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
Pete, he's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From ID, from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
I will blow you up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
And the threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
These are people who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat, the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President, we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
Bill, what do you think would happen to the power of the president, if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency, and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
Let's circle the wagons, okay?
- You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah.
This.
And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's 6th Street, tails it's 8th.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copy that.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife for a second?
It's not what they wanted to hear, but it's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old CI of Garrison's. 9 or 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- I don't know where he lives.
- He's fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. this afternoon, or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
Yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau--
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today!
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
I mean, they're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
Have you received adequate training for your profession?
No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days to violate
- Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless...
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life of our president in the last six months?
Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
- No, no.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Yes.
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
Sir, you have a phone call.
You can take it right here.
Thank you.
Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
FBI!
Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- FBI!
Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doing at Las Palmas?
- Having a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's going on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
You know that.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us, in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand.
So, let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there right now for a few hours?
- Yes, absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by for a while, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine.
It will be.
Has that guy called you?
What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
Oh, that's a great idea.
- How was your flight?
- Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash, and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest, once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
All right.
Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went to a place where he can mix up with the crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down!
Secret Service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to Command.
We need backup at the Allenwood Mall.
There is an agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command, copy that.
Available units en route.
ETA 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
They're shooting.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, all units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed in a wooded area...
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down...
Whether or not the president was on board has not...
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded...
We're now hearing reports the president was not on board Marine One.
Actually, we can now confirm that neither the president or the first lady were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David, where earlier today, Marine One went down shortly after take-off.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities,
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- ...that the chopper was shot down probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again, thatthepresidentand firstlady aresafe.
They were not on board at the time...
If you are just joining us, these are live pictures from the scene just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after take-off.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft, and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit!
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft, including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
It has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about a half mile...
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk...
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the FBI.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, what is this, all right?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
You screwed up, Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
- What motive do I have?
- I don't know, Pete.
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m. every goddamn morning.
So, is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
I mean, Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit, in charge of PPD, do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- Because I think this whole thing
- Come on, Pete.
- is getting a little personal, all right?
- We got you nailed to the wall.
I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- This has nothing to do with Cindy.
- I never did that thing,
- and you can't accept that.
- This isn't about...
We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence, and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile, because the flares and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Come on, Pete.
Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that, if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department, so that when the assassination actually took place,
- you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, I can't believe that.
- I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
- Why don't you cut the bullshit, Pete?
- Just think about it, all right?
- I wanna know where,
- You take me in, that's the end.
- how and when are they coming for us.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- You want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really...
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit!
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
!
And your radio?
What the hell are you looking at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
Now, I know it's very hard for you to believe that Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend.
To some, a legend.
But the fact is the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you to pull the trigger, if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
- Backstop.
- Go.
DiPaola to Command.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I mean, I really literally...
When the smokes clears, he taps him on the back, and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're moving.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
- I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
- You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no, no, no.
Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
- I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
No!
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through his stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called 'Chez Doucette'.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
- She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
- Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe the man protecting her for the last eight months is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters,
I want you to isolate Accords, Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the DC area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm with the Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number, ma'am, where I may be able to reach him?
I'd love to help you get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Hey, Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house looking for you.
He's a cop.
On a gut level, it doesn't make sense.
The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend for 10 years... till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing that Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa!
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
The traitor is still out there, Dave.
Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
The only reason that I'm alive
- is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on, shoot me!
Come on, shoot me.
What happened?
I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment the president's going to be in
- over the next few days?
- G8 Summit, Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the Three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
- Pete, you scared the hell out of me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents, so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell them about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No.
No, no, no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shoot-out.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to get straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- Yeah, there's blood all over the place, but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen to me.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete!
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
- Rip this place apart.
Find me something now!
- Yes, sir.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey, but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him, but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
US Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the 8th floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Hey, I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes,
- but if you want to grab a coffee, Jill...
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- Or not.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
- I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
Well, I did.
Jill, you gotta help me out on this one.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take to check them against the FBI and CIA databases?
Five minutes after I receive them.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
You know, in my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The First Lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
- Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former KGB, now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
Assume this is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still got to find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test, or if he even took it.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
20 years ago with the KGB, which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh, thank you.
William...
If you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the KGB's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route to the "B" motorcade under the plaza, and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
Copy.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're sure?
You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world,
America must be strong.
But previous administrations...
And I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the First Lady and tell her, only her, that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The First Lady?
What were you thinking?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Secret Service command post from Canadian CP, be advised.

Command Post from Post 209, be advised.
Suspect Garrison has just been let through...
- I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
- ...the south perimeter.
- All posts be advised.
- Ah, Jesus!
- Subject Garrison is on site in three.
- I got Garrison through the three.
- This resolution...
- Copy!
- ...cannot function alone.
- Do not admit...
- It is designed to function...
- ...
Garrison and Breckinridge to enter.
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons!
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge, lead investogator.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal...
- You need assistance?
Over.
...of an African economic union.
- He's a "Do-Not-Admit".
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose controls the site.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
Command to all units.
Lock down your location.
No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests without causing resentment.
- Get your hands in the air!
- Freeze!
Freeze!
- Put that down!
Put your hands in the air!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
You are a "Do-Not-Admit"!
We have orders!
- Mr. President, you've got to go.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
"Crystal"! "Crystal" is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the First Lady to the motorcade.
- Freeze!
- Password is "Crystal".
- Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B".
Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C", ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill!
Hold the corridor.
Push them back.
"Crystal"!
Pete, we're cut off from the "B" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you...
How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God!
Montrose was...
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11 o'clock.
I'll go high, you go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest Two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go, go, go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get them!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car.
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Secure the First Lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete...
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a Tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
- Take care.
- Thanks.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.

I just want to let you know what's goin' on.
I hate you.
[Chuckles]
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
- [Typing]
- And then there are the verbal threats.
[Man] He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining' this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
- No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
- How do you know that?
Well, he translated here- [Reading Spanish]
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
[Chuckles] Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
[Man Over Radio] Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a.45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
- Rosario.
- [Speaking Spanish]
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
- Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
- Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
- You gonna make me change my mind?
- [Chuckles]
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
[Knocking]
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
- And I definitely do.
- Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
[Chattering]
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
- [Radio Beeps]
- Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
- No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
- Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
[Voices Chattering Over Radios]
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got somethin' for me?
[Laughs] Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
- There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
- That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
[Man Over Radio, Indistinct]
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
[Camera Zoom Whirring, Shutter Clicking]
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
[Ballentine] Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
- Yeah.
- Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
[Man] I will blow you up.
I come to bomb this country.
[Indistinct] Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
- Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
- Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
- Yeah.
- [Coins Jingling]
This.
[Ballentine] And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
[Siren Blares]
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
[Woman Over Radio] Copy that.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
[People Chattering]
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
[Envelope Rustling]
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. this afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- [Woman] Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
[Man] Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
[All] No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
- You look worse.
- [Chuckles]
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- [Woman] Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
- [Camera Shutter Clicks]
- Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- [Man] Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.

- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
[Car Engines Start]
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
- Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
- Short.
- [Teddy] You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- [Xavier] Do you got the money?
- [Pete] I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
[Xavier Chuckles] Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.

[Sirens Wailing]
Pete.
Pete!
- [People Chattering] - [Man Over Radio, Indistinct]
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
[Carl] Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
[Woman Over TV] This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
[Man Over TV] Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
[Man Over TV] We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One...
- [Speaking Foreign Language] went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
- [Foreign Language]
[Woman] If you are just joining us, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- [Man] I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
[Dial Tone Humming]
[Man] Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
- Has not been confirmed by investigators.
- [Knocking]
- Again, these pictures coming to us about- - [Shuts TV Off]
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
- [Door Opens]
- Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
[Breckinridge] You screwed up, Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m. every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The-
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
- You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
- [Whistles]
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
[Sighs]
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
- [Gasping]
- Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin' at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
[Man] Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
[Voices Chattering Over Radios]
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Yeah?
[Woman Over Radio] Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
[Man Over Radio] Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
[Car Alarm Wailing]
[Both Laughing]
[Man Over Radio] Backstop, go.
[DiPaola] Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
[Chattering]
[Man] He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
- [Man #2] That's not funny, man.
- [Laughing]
- [Man #2] That joke ain't funny at all.
- [Phone Ringing]
- [Man Over Radio] Fullback.
We're movin'.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
- Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
- I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
[Moans]
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
[Car Alarm Beeping]
[People Chattering]
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
- Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
- Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
- Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
- Sweepstakes?
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
- He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.

Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
[Beeps]
[Phone Dialing]
[Writing]
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.

Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
[Creaking]
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
- The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
- Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
[Panting]
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
[Gasps]
- Pete, you scared me!
- Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
[No Audible Dialogue]
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
[Dogs Barking]
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no. no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- [Gunfire Continues]
- Shooting.
Shooting.
- [Russian] Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
[Bottles Clattering On Floor]
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
- [Knocking]
- Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Oh!
[Line Ringing]
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
[Dialing]
[Computerized Voice] One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
- Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- [Sarah] Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
[Sarah] Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
[Hand Dryer Blowing]
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
[Voices Chattering Over Radios]
[Man Over Radio] Sweeps two and three now complete.
[Bell Ringing]
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. and C.I.A. databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
[Sighs]
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G. B... now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
[Montrose] You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
[Chattering]
[Man Over Radio] Command Post from Apache follow-up.

We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
[Crowd Applauding]
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.

[Man Over Radio] Be advised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
[Woman Over Radio] Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
[Ballentine] This resolution cannot function alone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
[Whispering]
[Man Over Radio] No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
[Static Blaring Over All Radios]
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
[Ballentine] But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
- [Elevator Bell Dings]
- Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- [Breckinridge] Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- [Woman] You are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- [Breckinridge] Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
[Chattering]
It's all right.
- Freeze!
- Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
[Woman] We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
[Gasps]
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
[Hassad] Pete, we're cut off from the "B" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you- How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
[Montrose] Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.

We'll cover you from here.

This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
[Groans] Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
[Sirens Wailing]
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
[Groans]
[Gasps]
[Breckinridge] The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

Listen, Pete, um-
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.

I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.

All the best.

You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.

Allposts,allposts, Classic and Cinci moving to hold.
- Cincinnati's going direct to the beach house.
- Got it.
Now, I want to introduce you to someone-
Chilton security to all posts.
Classic wrapping up.
My wife, Sarah.
Thank you.
DiPaolatocommand.
Cincinnati leaving school for Serenity.
Break.
DiPaola to Serenity security room.
E. T.A. 1800 hours.
How do you think it went in there?
- Excuse me, ma'am, are you talking to me?
- Yes.
I thought it was, uh, an excellent speech.
- One to 10?
- Ten, ma'am.
You're not a very good liar, Pete.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
I
- I really want to know.
9.5.
Excuse me.
Charlie?
Charlie.
Charlie!
Oh, my God.
Charlie.
Somebody!
Help!
Charlie.
Charlie.
Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's goin' on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then there are the verbal threats.
He'sa deadman.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's ruining' this country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
How do you know that?
Well, he translated here-
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going' on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
- Here comes the Secret Service.
- I really don't need them breathing' down my neck.
What do they know about investigating' murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents Breckinridge, Marin.
Secret Service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it,he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, Merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see... is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
- Human nature.
- There's no money left in his wallet... and there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, Agent Merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger... to notice anything outside of the ordinary... so for some average street criminal to get the drop on him-yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a.45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, Detective.
Rosario.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
- So what are you sayin'?
- Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet... and stopped it from penetrating the wood... which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, Detective.
Excuse me.
Agent Merriweather's firearm- the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent Marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you... to draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions... to avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon,we intend to use it.
Bottom line- Agent Merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the Potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
And I definitely do.
Garrison, DiPaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, roger, 10-60.
I let DiPaola go early, so, uh, he can... get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
This is outstanding.
There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
Garrison, DiPaola.
Where are you?
- Garrison, DiPaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or-
Aziz, what are you doin' here?
Charlie Merriweather was murdered.
He
- He was murdered?
P.I.D. thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
- Did he tell you why?
- He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you... but I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just-
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me... but you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
Otherwise, stay out of my way.
Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
- No.
- Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You workin' with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, Tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore... offered to transfer the call to W.F.O., P.I.D.
- He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
- Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers Clearing House, my man!
You got somethin' for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie Merriweather murder?
- That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
- Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the Secret Service?
That's right.
There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
That's right.
Well, what's his name?
I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who-Who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
- You get me the money, and I will disappear.
- I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words,today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is... they're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "Q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve... to take on the infrastructure of terrorism... wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, Barranquilla Cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "Q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out,this is very important-
Polygraph everyone on that list... and stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on Merriweather is connected to this... so let's fold that investigation in as well.
- And we put Breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
- He's the best we've got?
Yeah.
Pete.
He's kind of a protégé of yours.
What do you think?
- He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
- Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get carte blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
- I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
- No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
Iwillblowyou up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of Al-Qaeda... have met on at least two occasions with the Barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the Camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the White House in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat... the investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. President... we're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president... if people thought I wasn't even safe from my own Secret Service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency... and I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah.
This.
AndI promiseyou, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's Sixth Street, tails it's Eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copythat.
Command to alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old C.I. of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
- He's a fanatic about not being followed.
- You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
- What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
- A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p.m. this afternoon... or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Haveyoueverhad contactwith childpornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau-
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the Service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the Secret Service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
- Have you received adequate training for your profession?
- No.
But I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express.
Have you ever violated Secret Service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- to violate Secret Service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, Bill.
You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
- You know I can't even let you back on duty unless-
- Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
- Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
- No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated Secret Service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life... of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to Mayflower Hotel.
Mayflower Hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
- Thank you.
- Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
- Take a left on 12th Street.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
- All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12:13 Acela Express... with stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
F.B.I. Drop it!
Federal agent!
Federal agent!
F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
- What the hell were you doin' at Las Palmas?
- Havin' a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's goin' on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
I don't like worms.
No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us... in uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the Secret Service?
Inside my detail?
Now, Bill's been briefing me, of course, but... this guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand... so let's make time at Camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. President.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
- Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
- Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
- It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
- Nothing about this feels okay or fine or-
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash... and a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
- Yeah, right.
- Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood Mall food court at 11:00 a.m.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
- Breckinridge and Marin are already on the way.
- All right.
- Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
- Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna..
..let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.

He's on the lower level.

E. T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.

Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington Command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, Allenwood Mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, Marine One, has crashed.
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not-
Marine One, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of Camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded-
We'renowhearingreports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm... that neither the president or the first lady... were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside Camp David...
- where earlier today, Marine One... went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail... just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
- Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
- that the chopper was shot down... probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
- that the president and first lady are safe.
Ifyouarejustjoiningus, these are live pictures from the scene... just outside of Camp David, where earlier today Marine One went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and Secret Service personnel were on that aircraft... and they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the White House and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a-
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft... including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about-
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk-
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life... without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the Barranquilla Cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, Special Agent Ortega with the F.B.I.
What were you doing at the Las Palmas Coffee Shop?
- I was having a cup of coffee.
- Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom DiPaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the Marine One flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las Palmas Coffee Shop is a dead drop for the Barranquilla Cartel.
Youscrewedup ,Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the Secret Service.
- I've gotten up at 4:00 a.m. every goddamn morning.
- Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the president of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor... on a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit... in charge of P.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
- I think this whole thing is getting personal.
- We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
- Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
- I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las Palmas Coffee Shop.
You had unfettered access to Marine One.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares... and the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
- The what?
The-
- Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if I wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department... so that when the assassination actually took place... you'd be at the bottom f the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
You take me in, that's the end.
That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really-
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is Breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you lookin' at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend,to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you... to pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Yeah?
Fullback, Backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, Fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
- That joke ain't funny at all.
Fullback.
We're movin'.
Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
- Welke, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
- Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
- This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
- No, no.
Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
- I'm checking through stuff.
- Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez Doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
DiPaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe... the man protecting her for the last eight months... is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance... of the restaurant or any of the nearby metro stations.
Then within those parameters, I want you to isolate Accords...
- Tauruses, Camrys and Explorers.
- How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
Sweepstakes?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm with Publishers Clearing House.
He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's Mom.
A guy just come by the house lookin' for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
- The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
- And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the Academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend... for 10 years...
till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not Tom DiPaola... just signed in to our databases using DiPaola's password.
- Pulled up an address in Andrewsboro, Maryland.
- I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify Intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is Breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret Service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the Kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
- the president's going to be in over the next few days?
- G8 Summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
Pete, you scared me!
Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents... so I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
- Who are they?
- I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the Secret Service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no. no.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
-Your name!
Who sent you?
-Who sent you!
Come on.
-Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, Northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the G8 Summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But I really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over... but there's no body, no passports, no G8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to Overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, G8 Summit.
Pete.
Pete?
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm
- I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if I don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
Rip this place apart.
Find me something now.
- This is Agent Breckinridge.
- Agent Breckinridge?
Sarah Ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, Tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey... but my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and I are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him... but I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. Secret Service up for the G8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
- That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
- Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- but if you want to grab a coffee-
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take... to check them against the F.B.I. and C.I.A. databases?
Five minutes after I receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station... and check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
- You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
- Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to Gennady Ivanov, former K.G.B. ..
now works for the personal security service for the president of Karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy... responsible for the Central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, Agent Marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at Camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the K.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William... if you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the K.G.B. 's gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route... to the "B" motorcade under the plaza... and you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with Downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did Montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command Post from Apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, DiPaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of Montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations-
I also hacked into Merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are Montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her- only her- that it's Montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinkin'?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Beadvised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Beadvised, suspect Garrison has just been let through-
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
Thisresolutioncannotfunctionalone.
It is designed-
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm Agent Breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
- We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
- Need assistance, over.
- He's a Do Not Admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
Nounauthorizedpersonnelbeyondthetwoperimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that Montrose is the mole.
ButI stronglybelieve that we can protect our vital interests... without causing resentment.
Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- You are a Do Not Admit!
- But at the same time-
- Mr. President.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. President.
- Do not let Montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
Freeze!
Password is Crystal.
Where'd Montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "B."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "C," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the G8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete,we'recutoff fromthe" B"motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they..
..know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you- How do you know?
Oh, no, Bill.
Oh, God.
Montrose was-
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. President, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high.
You go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. President, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um-
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
- I'm gonna walk out of the White House carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.

Any other supportive advice before we get to know each other?
As a matter of fact, there is.
If you want a career here in p.I.D., you might want to...
Invest in some more appropriate clothing.
I was ordered to take you on.
That's why I'm here.
You requested me as a t.A. Why?
My field instructor at the academy said you're the best investigator we have.
- Who is that?
- Pete Garrison.

Mr. president, keep up the good work!
Hey, Mr. president!
- Hi.
How are you?
- President ballentine!
How are you?
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
All posts, all posts, classic and cinci moving to hold.
Cincinnati's going direct to the beach house.
Got it.
Now, I want to introduce you to someone...
Chilton security to all posts.
Classic wrapping up.
My wife, Sarah.
Thank you.
Dipaola to command.
Cincinnati leaving school for Serenity.
Break.
Dipaola to Serenity security room.
Es.
T.A. 1800 hours.
How do you think it went in there?
- Excuse me, ma'am, are you talking to me?
- Yes.
I thought it was, uh, an excellent speech.
- One to 10?
- Ten, ma'am.
You're not a very good liar, Pete.
- Seriously?
- Yes.
I...
I really want to know.
9.5.
Excuse me.
Charlie?
Charlie.
Charlie!
Oh, my god.
Charlie.
Somebody!
Help!
Charlie.
Charlie.
Somebody help!
I just wanted to say hi.
I just want to let you know what's going on.
I hate you.
I saw you on the news.
I got your message.
I know you want me to kill you.
- Excuse me.
- Um, yeah.
Sorry.
- So all of these are from last week?
- That's about half of them.
And then there are the verbal threats.
He's a dead man.
I'm gonna kill him and his whole family.
He's rhinitis country, and I'm gonna gut him like a fish.
- They sound worse in English.
- Yeah.
We got this guy yesterday.
Did you translate this?
No.
But whoever did's not a native speaker.
How do you know that?
Well, he translated here...
And that literally means "to put pressure on him, he bit the guy."
As if he was being tortured.
But that's not what it means here.
It's slang.
It means he bribed him.
He didn't bite him.
Good.
We need to talk.
I think you have a little spinach or something in your teeth.
I want you to route all calls through to my cell.
You picked a hell of a day to start your field work.
- Button up your jacket.
- Why?
What going on?
Dispatch, this is Charlie 9.
Units on scene.
Here comes the secret service.
I really don't need them breathing down my neck.
What do they know about investigating murder?
She can breathe down my neck.
But not him.
Agents breckinridge, marin.
Secret service.
- You guys bring lunch?
- Not today.
The way I see it, he hands over the wallet.
As the guy reaches for it, merriweather goes for his gun.
Bad guy shoots him first.
- You think this is a street crime?
- In my gut, yeah.
You know my problem with gut feelings?
Once you have them, the only evidence you see...
Is the evidence that reinforces your gut feeling.
Human nature.
There's no money left in his wallet...
And there's been a series of robberies here the last two months.
You have some reason to think it wasn't a robbery?
Well, agent merriweather spent the last 25 years honing his ability to sense danger...
To notice anything outside of the ordinary...
So for some average street criminal to get the drop on him... yeah, it raises questions.
Not to mention that he's been shot here twice with a. 45.
I'm gonna take a guess here, but from your initial canvassing, I bet you no one heard anything.
Any homicide cop will tell you that sort of thing happens all the time.
Yeah, I bet they would, detective.
Rosario.
Anyone want anything to eat or drink?
Uh, no, thanks, ma'am.
I think we're fine.
Well, I'm hungry.
Tom, sweep downstairs and go for dinner.
I'll sweep upstairs, sit post till the shift change.
You sure?
You've been on as long as me.
You gonna make me change my mind?
Detective, take a look at the bullet mark on the doorjamb.
The slug didn't penetrate.
It's cedar, which is a soft wood.
It gets brittle with age.
So what are you saying?
Bad guy used a silencer.
That's why nobody heard it.
And that's what slowed down the velocity of the bullet...
And stopped it from penetrating the wood...
Which it easily would have done had it been traveling at its normal rate of speed.
The shooter was standing right here.
One other thing, detective.
Excuse me.
Agent merriweather's firearm... the safety's still on.
We assumed he just didn't have time to flick it off.
Agent marin, why don't you explain to the detectives why that is unlikely.
If he was a police officer, it would make sense because your academy trains you...
To draw your weapon and flip the safety in two separate actions...
To avoid accidental shootings.
Our academy trains us to draw and flip in a single motion.
If he managed to draw his weapon, his safety should have been off.
A protective agent maybe draws his weapon once an entire presidential term.
When we draw our weapon, we intend to use it.
Bottom line... agent merriweather was assassinated.
I want the murder weapon.
I don't care if you have to drag the potomac.
If this man was one of yours, you would have treated him with a lot more respect.
Let's get a gurney up here!
It always amazes me how thorough you are.
Well, we try to do the best job we can.
Hopefully you sleep better at night.
And I definitely do.
Garrison, dipaola.
We're good on the perimeter.
- I'm 10-60.
- Uh, Roger, 10-60.
I let dipaola go early, so, uh, he can...
Get something to eat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You all right?
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
- Just a second.
- Okay.
- This is outstanding.
- There you go.
And enjoy.
I love you, Sarah.
- Garrison, dipaola.
- Where are you?
- Garrison, dipaola, where are you?
- Shit.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Hi.
So what the hell is going on, or...
Aziz, what are you doing here?
Charlie merriweather was murdered.
He... he was murdered?
P.I.D. Thinks it might be connected to work.
Director put us on alert.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Was there any kind of shift in his behavior?
Was he agitated or worried about anything?
He was a little distant at breakfast on Sunday.
Did he tell you why?
He just said he had a couple of tough days at work.
- What'd he say at breakfast?
- Some gossip.
Uh, it's kind of personal.
Nancy, I know how difficult this is for you...
But I need a complete picture if I'm gonna investigate this properly.
He told me that he thought Pete Garrison was having an affair with someone's wife at work.
- Just gossip.
It just...
- Yeah.
Probably not even true.
Look, that's all we need for now.
- You got the lead on Charlie's murder?
- Screw you.
- What?
- Screw you.
- You still got a problem with me?
- Take your hands off of me.
Christ.
It doesn't matter what I say to you.
I don't care if you got a problem with me...
But you show respect when you come to this house.
Charlie was one of my best friends.
If you have information that can help me, that I want to hear.
- Otherwise, stay out of my way.
- Fine.
You're a piece of work.
You know, Nancy did say one thing.
Charlie was upset about something at work.
You have any idea what that might be?
No.
Then if you figure it out, you know where to find me.
- Yeah, good.
I'll send you a memo.
- Do that.
- Hey.
Is everything okay?
- Hey, Jill.
Yeah.
- You working with him now?
- Yeah.
Keep your eyes open.
You may learn a lot.
But don't listen to everything he's got to say.
- Especially about me.
- Okay.
Pete.
There some problem between you two?
- I thought you were friends.
- We were.
- So what happened?
- It's personal.
Let's go.
No.
He can go to hell.
I don't want to talk to him.
Just tell him it wasn't me.
- It wasn't anybody.
- I'm not saying it was.
- I wasn't having an affair!
- Cindy, I know you weren't.
What do you want me to tell him I haven't already told him 30 times?
This is why I left him.
He's the most pigheaded man I've ever met.
You still love him, don't you?
- Hey, Pete.
Pete.
- Hey, tom.
You know a guy named Walter Xavier?
Yeah, sure.
He's a snitch I used to use when I was working in counterfeiting.
Okay.
Just fielded a call from this guy.
I told him you weren't running informants anymore...
Offered to transfer the call to w.F.O., p.I.D.
He said you're the only person he'd talk to.
Thanks.
There he is!
Publishers clearing house, my man!
You got something for me?
Did you fill yours out yet?
Every year my mom bugs me to fill that thing out.
I never do.
Long time, no see, Walter.
What's up?
Let's walk.
You got some info on that Charlie merriweather murder?
That agent who was killed outside his house on Monday?
Yeah.
Maybe he stumbled into something he wasn't supposed to, like I did.
- What was that something?
- A plot to kill the president.
Walter, you know, it's a little more difficult than it sounds.
Not if you got somebody inside.
You saying there's a mole in the secret service?
That's right.
There's an agent who wants to help assassinate the president?
That's right.
- Well, what's his name?
- I don't know.
I just know he exists.
Well, how?
Who... who's giving you the information?
- I want one million dollars.
- What are you smoking, Walter?
- Now be serious.
- I'm dead serious.
I tell you this stuff, you roll these guys up, they gonna know I'm the one.
- They'll hunt me down.
- We'll put you in protective custody.
Yeah, and I'll be dead in a day.
Listen, you got a traitor in your organization.
You get me the money, and I will disappear.
I gotta be honest with you.
I find it pretty far-fetched we got agents in on an assassination attempt.
Here.
Maybe this will change your mind, okay?
Call signs, code words, today's encryption keys!
Yeah, whoever this traitor is...
They're either on the president's detail or in a key liaison position.
Listen, I want a list of everyone who's got "q" clearance.
And where's the president right now?
Press conference at his house.
Twenty minutes.
This morning's action demonstrates our continuing resolve...
To take on the infrastructure of terrorism...
Wherever we find it anywhere around the globe.
How reliable is this guy Xavier?
I've built three counterfeiting cases using his information.
- Against who?
- Mid-level guys, barranquilla cartel.
Sir.
That's everyone with "q" clearance.
Those who actually commit terrorist acts.
Now let me point out, this is very important...
Polygraph everyone on that list...
And stand up a red team to find the traitor.
Now, I'm going to assume that the hit on merriweather is connected to this...
So let's fold that investigation in as well.
And we put breckinridge in charge of the whole thing.
He's the best we've got?
Yeah.
Pete.
He's kind of a protege of yours.
What do you think?
He'll follow the evidence wherever it leads him.
Then he's the guy.
You can have anybody you want.
From I.D., from the field.
You get crate blanche.
- Not right now.
- Oh, sorry.
I can tell personnel you need to lose the rookie.
No, I'm gonna keep her.
She hasn't been ruined by years in the field.
I will blow you up.
I come to bomb this country.
Holy wars.
We have intel that representatives of al-qaeda...
Have met on at least two occasions with the barranquilla leadership.
You think it's timed to coincide with the camp David talks?
Probably.
The threat alone interferes with the process.
We pulled 50 agents in from the field.
People who haven't worked at the white house in at least two cycles.
They'll integrate with both of your teams.
We're all gonna be looking over each other's shoulders till we find this guy, sir.
Well, do what you have to to protect me, but I want the threat...
The investigation, I want everything kept classified.
As far as the public is concerned, I'm just carrying on my normal business.
- Is that clear?
- Mr. president...
We're going to need to get everyone involved here.
What do you think would happen to the power of the president...
If people thought I wasn't even safe from my own secret service?
It took over 200 years to create the symbol of the presidency...
And I'm not gonna undermine it with something like this.
Let's circle the wagons, okay?
You all right?
Fine.
Good, let's do that.
How do we proceed?
Bill, you're the guy.
You're the last line of defense.
You can protect him better than any of us can.
Is there anything else that you can think of that'll help you do that?
Yeah.
This.
And I promise you, right here and now, we're gonna win this one.
You can bank on it.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you.
Heads it's sixth street, tails it's eighth.
Bravo cars.
- This way, Mr. president.
- Thank you, bill.
Classic is moving to bravo cars.
Copy that.
Command to Alpha cars.
You are off the hook.
Sir, could you put down that knife?
It's not what they wanted to hear.
It's what they needed to hear.
Hello, young lady.
Where'd this guy come from?
He's an old c.I. Of Garrison's.
Nine, 10 years.
- Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
It's okay.
- How do I find Xavier?
- Um, I don't know where he lives.
He's a fanatic about not being followed.
You ever tried?
- What?
- Have you ever tried?
He wants a million bucks from us, Dave.
I'm sure he'll contact us.
You better be right.
You get in touch with us as soon as you find him.
Could be any one of them.
It makes you a little sick, doesn't it?
What percentage of your people have had a polygraph?
A little over half.
"Over half"?
The president's life is at stake.
Heads up!
I want everybody in this room to have had a polygraph by 5:00 p.
M. This afternoon...
Or don't show up for work tomorrow.
- Were you born in Morocco?
- No.
- Do you live in Bethesda?
- No.
- Were you born in Alabama?
- No.
Have you ever had contact with child pornography?
Uh, yes.
I was involved with an investigation with the bureau...
- Just yes or no answers, please.
- Okay, Stan.
Yes.
Are you up?
The witch hunt is on.
Get your polygraph today.
How did they get these?
Night-vision camera on a boat stabilized by a gyroscope.
Pretty sophisticated.
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm sorry.
It's gotta be someone inside the service.
Somebody could have picked it up.
They're good.
That's what they do.
Who?
The same agent plotting to kill John?
Who?
141 years there's never been a traitor in the secret service.
Now, all of a sudden, there's two?
I don't buy that.
Somehow they're connected.
Maybe this is the assassination?
This is a death sentence for John, a political death sentence.
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, Pete.
Sarah, I promise.
Let's get this goddamn witch hunt over with.
- Just relax.
- I'm relaxed.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- No.
Have you received adequate training for your profession?
No.
But I did stay in a holiday inn express.
Have you ever violated secret service protocol in the past 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything in the past 30 days...
- To violate secret service protocol?
- No.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the President of the United States?
No.
I could use a few of those.
- Thanks.
- You look exhausted, bill.
You look worse.
I haven't slept since we went on alert.
Well, I'm back on.
It's worse than going to confession.
Have you done your polygraph yet?
You know I can't even let you back on duty unless...
Yeah, I'll go now.
- Is your name Peter Garrison?
- Yes.
Are you involved in a plot to kill the president?
No.
- Were you divorced in 1998?
- Yes.
Have you violated secret service protocols in the last 30 days?
No.
Have you done anything to endanger the life...
Of our president in the last six months?
- Not that I know of.
- Yes or no answers, please.
No.
No.
Welcome to mayflower hotel.
Mayflower hotel, can I help you?
Just a moment, sir.
- Are you Mr. Garrison?
- Yes.
You have a phone call.
You can take it here.
Thank you.
Walk three blocks east on Massachusetts Avenue.
Take a left on 12th street.
Las palmas coffee shop.
All right.
Now boarding on track 4, 12: 13 acela express...
With stops in Philadelphia, New York, Boston.
Now boarding, track 4.
F.B.I. Drop it!
- Federal agent!
Federal agent!
- F.B.I. Freeze!
Put it down!
- The gun is going down!
- All right.
Back up now.
Back up.
Turn around!
What the hell were you doing at las palmas?
Having a goddamn cup of coffee.
What the hell's going on here?
Is that one of your agents I'm following?
Sorry for the crossover.
Pete!
I called four times.
Where the hell have you been?
We're not out of here till tomorrow.
The president decided they should arrive at the summit together.
Where were you?
Oh!
Excuse me.
Oh, here we are.
Now, Kate, this is your weekend to catch the trout.
- I don't like worms.
- No, no.
This is fly-fishing.
Pete, can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, sir.
We're really, both of us...
In uncharted territory here, aren't we?
An assassin inside the secret service?
Inside my detail?
Now, bill's been briefing me, of course, but...
This guy's your informant, right?
- Yes, sir.
- I want to get some of this firsthand...
So let's make time at camp David to do that, all right?
Yes, sir.
Good afternoon, Mr. president.
Good afternoon.
I'll see you at dinner.
- So, Karen, how do things stand?
- It's time for you to weigh in.
Can I get you in there now for a few hours?
Absolutely.
Sarah, the wives are talking about having tea.
If you could stop by, it would be great.
- Sure.
- Tom, we're gonna walk it.
What's going on, Pete?
Why don't they just tell us what they want?
It's okay.
It's gonna be fine.
Nothing about this feels okay or fine or...
- It will be.
- Has that guy called you?
- What's his name?
What's that guy's name?
- Xavier.
- Has he called you?
- Not yet.
No.
- Katie, hi.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.
- Hi.
- Would you care for tea?
It's such a beautiful day.
Why don't we have tea outside?
Well, that's a great idea.
How was your flight?
Short.
- You guys all decent?
- Afraid so.
Your informant's on the phone.
- Do you got the money?
- I got $100,000 in cash...
And a legal document guaranteeing you the rest once the traitor's apprehended.
Yeah, right.
Walter, we haven't screwed you in the past.
I'm not gonna start now.
Otherwise, all our sources would dry up.
Allenwood mall food court at 11:00 a.
M.
And don't try to bring nobody.
I'll walk if I spot 'em.
I cannot get there in 20 minutes.
- Drive fast.
- Okay, you heard him.
Let's go.
Breckinridge and marin are already on the way.
All right.
Get the money bag and a car ready, please.
Okay.
Got it.
He knows we're following him.
He went where he can mix up with a crowd.
There's no way we get surveillance in there.
Hold it.
There's no way I'm gonna let you go without a backup.
No.
- Chaminski.
Chaminski goes with you.
- Let's go.
At your 1:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Watch your 3:00.
Check your 9:00.
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Check your 9:00!
Get down!
Secret service!
Get down!
Shots fired.
Shots fired.
Agent down.
Copy that.
Breckinridge to command.
We need backup at the allenwood mall.
Agent down.
The shooter has blond hair, dark jacket.
He's on the lower level.
Command, copy that.
Available units en route.
Es.T.A. 20 minutes.
They're shooting.
They're right behind the doors.
Heads.
Pete, we're at the north end of the mall.
Lower level.
I'm a hundred yards south of you.
Unholster your weapon.
Keep it down.
- Work your way towards me.
- Copy that.
Stagger off 10 feet.
Get out of here!
Take the point.
I don't have a visual!
Go!
Garrison, Washington command.
Additional agents and medical assist are en route.
Break.
All units, be advised.
Shots fired, allenwood mall.
One agent is down.
There are multiple civilian casualties.
Shooter is male, blond hair, dark jacket.
Pete.
Pete!
You okay?
Do you have any idea why your informant wanted to have you killed?
No.
I'm wondering the same thing.
You might want to figure that one out, Pete.
Pete!
Presidential helicopter just went down.
This is a news center special report.
The presidential helicopter, marine one, has crashed.
Marine one, the presidential helicopter has gone down.
Whether or not the president was on board has not...
Marine one, the presidential helicopter has crashed.
It happened just moments ago about a half mile south of camp David.
The chopper went down in some densely wooded...
We're now hearing reports the president was not on board.
Actually, we can now confirm...
That neither the president or the first lady...
Were on board at the time of the crash.
The president and first lady are safe.
If you're just joining us, these are live pictures just outside camp David...
Where earlier today, marine one...
Went down shortly after takeoff.
Two hikers who witnessed the crash reported seeing a contrail or fiery tail...
Just before that helicopter went down.
That is leading to the possibility, unconfirmed by authorities...
Our friend was insufficiently motivated.
That the chopper was shot down...
Probably by a shoulder-fired missile.
Now, we want to make clear, again...
That the president and first lady are safe.
If you are just joining us, these are live pictures from the scene...
Just outside of camp David, where earlier today marine one went down just after takeoff.
Sources say marine and secret service personnel were on that aircraft...
And they were killed in the crash.
This crash is being investigated by both the white house and the military.
- You failed.
- I did exactly what I promised.
He wasn't on board.
That is the only thing that matters.
That is the only thing I give a shit a...
Do you understand?
Now, we're gonna meet and we're gonna discuss this.
Deadly against any low-altitude aircraft...
Including jets, prop planes and helicopters.
But that comes from witnesses.
Has not been confirmed by investigators.
Again, these pictures coming to us about...
Well, it sure doesn't look like you're here to bury the hatchet.
You're being investigated for treason.
- What are you talk...
- Step back.
- Excuse me?
- Step back.
- Hey, Jill.
- Pete.
- Matt.
- Pete.
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.
If I failed the polygraph, then why am I still on duty?
Director didn't want to arrest one of the guys responsible for saving Reagan's life...
Without a little more evidence.
How long you been working for the barranquilla cartel?
What are you talking about?
Hugo, can you come in here, please?
Pete Garrison, special agent Ortega with the f.B.I.
What were you doing at the las palmas coffee shop?
I was having a cup of coffee.
Takes you four hours to have a cup of coffee?
I was killing a few hours at a coffee shop.
Is there a problem with that?
Tom dipaola said he called you four times.
You never returned any of his messages.
And that you almost missed the marine one flight yesterday.
They moved the flight up two hours.
I was in the coffee shop.
It was noisy.
I couldn't hear my cell phone.
Now, wh-wh-what is this?
What the hell are you doing following me?
Las palmas coffee shop is a dead drop for the barranquilla cartel.
You screwed up, Pete.
You walked into a stakeout.
I wanna know your number one go-to guy at the cartel.
And I wanna know how you were gonna help them kill the president.
Why would I want to kill the president?
What motive do I have?
To be honest with you, I don't care.
I know what the evidence is telling me.
I have given my entire life to the secret service.
I've gotten up at 4:00 a.
M. Every goddamn morning.
Is that what this is about?
You're bitter after all your years of service that they didn't make you director?
Oh, no.
Don't confuse your own ambition with mine.
Okay, Dave?
Come on, Pete.
Think about it.
People would understand that.
Jesus Christ, you took a bullet for the President of the United States.
And in the 25 years since, you haven't even made shift supervisor...
On a presidential detail, and that I know you wanted.
But they don't put guys that bend the rules, not even a little bit...
In charge of p.P.D., do they?
Even if they did take a bullet for the old man.
Is that your professional or personal opinion?
I think this whole thing is getting personal.
We got you nailed to the wall.
- I didn't have an affair with Cindy.
- Has nothing to do with Cindy.
- You can't accept that.
- We are not talking about that!
We're talking about it all the time, even when we're not talking about it!
You can't look at me without thinking about it!
Jesus Christ, Pete, you better get a grip.
I got a grip.
You think I wrecked your marriage, and it has completely clouded your judgment.
I am following the evidence and it is overwhelming.
The polygraph.
Las palmas coffee shop.
You had unfettered access to marine one.
It was hit by a missile for Christ's sake!
It was hit by a missile because the flares...
And the four other countermeasures were disengaged!
There was a hundred other people who had access to it.
Explain to me about the bank account.
The what?
The...
Your signature's all over the paperwork.
I'm being framed.
- Tell me that's not your signature.
- Think about it!
I'm the guy that initiated this investigation.
Why would I do that if i wanted to kill the president?
You initiated this investigation for a traitor in our department...
So that when the assassination actually took place...
You'd be at the bottom of the list of suspects.
I'm being framed!
Goddamn it!
Just think about it.
- You take me in, that's the end.
- That guy is out there somewhere!
The director just rolled up outside.
You better start thinking about cooperating.
He's in the car.
- What are you doing, Pete?
- Getting a glass of water.
Director's come all the way down here to see me, huh?
- That's very impressive.
- It's embarrassing for us, sir.
- Want a beer?
- Look, Pete, we're really...
Garrison back door.
Oh, shit.
Pete!
Where is he?
Sorry.
This is breckinridge.
Garrison has escaped from the rear of the residence into the alley.
Cordon off the area and get back to me.
- He got my radio.
- He got my gun too.
He got your gun?
And your radio?
What the hell are you looking at her for?
She's been here two days.
How long have you been here?
Where to, mister?
Just get me out of here.
I know it's hard to believe Pete Garrison could be involved with something like this.
For most of you he's a friend, to some, a legend.
But the fact is, the evidence against him is overwhelming.
So, how do we find him?
To begin with, know this.
He is smarter and more experienced than all of you.
You've never trained for this.
You are chasing your worst nightmare.
He knows how you think.
He knows what you know.
And he knows how you operate.
And he will use that against you.
He also knows that it's gonna be very difficult for you...
To pull the trigger if you have him in your sights.
So I want you to take a second and visualize that.
Because there is a very good chance that is exactly how this is going to end.
- Can I have one of these here?
- Yeah, sure.
Take it.
Yeah?
Fullback, backstop.
Do you have an arrival?
Backstop, fullback.
We have arrival.
Backstop, go.
Cincinnati wrapping up.
We're Alpha for departure.
I miss the good old days.
Do you know what I mean?
I really literally do.
He taps him on the back and the bear says...
"You didn't come here to hunt, did ya?"
Get it?
The bear.
That's not funny, man.
That joke ain't funny at all.
- Fullback.
We're moving.
- Roger that.
We're set up.
See you later, okay?
Be right back.
Thank you.
Welke, dipaola.
Cincinnati's coming to you.
Copy that.
Ma'am.
What are you doing here?
I heard you were arrested for the helicopter.
Whatever you hear about me in the next few days, I want you to know I was framed.
- I had to tell you to your face.
- No, you don't.
No, you don't.
- We're gonna get out of this.
- How?
I haven't figured that out yet.
This is out of control.
You've got to turn yourself in.
No, no.
Yes, you do.
I'll go to John.
I'll tell him everything.
I can't let you do that.
Pete, they think you're an assassin.
They will kill you.
- You can cover my back.
- How?
The director has got a daily password for the agents.
Find out what it is.
I'm checking through stuff.
Hey, guys.
Garrison just used his cell phone.
He called Chez doucette.
You turned around when it rang, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
Ballsy.
Very ballsy.
Dipaola said she seemed completely unfazed.
She came upstairs, waited five minutes and told him what happened.
Okay.
I'm just trying to understand why he came here and why she reacted that way.
- This is your post?
- Yeah, it is.
Naturally, the first lady doesn't want to believe...
The man protecting her for the last eight months...
Is trying to assassinate her husband.
That's why Pete came here.
He's looking for an ally.
And the first lady is a very powerful ally to have.
Great.
The idea is to secure the entire site.
I want you to get every stolen car report for the entire area.
Start looking for cars that were taken within walking distance...
Of the restaurant or any of the nearby Metro stations.
Then within those parameters, i want you to isolate accords...
Tauruses, camrys and explorers.
How do you know what kind of car he's gonna steal?
Those are the four most commonly registered vehicles in the D.C. area.
Pete knows that.
He's gonna want to blend in.
And the first thing he's gonna want to do is find his informant.
If he tries to breach our computers, we can find out where he's connecting from.
He knows we would know that.
He wouldn't do it.
- He could connect to someone else.
- How?
Well, he'd need that person's password.
But as a supervisor, it wouldn't be hard to get access to others' passwords.
Why would he do that?
Why would he even risk it?
Because he feels trapped.
We have his credit cards, his cell phone.
He has no other place to hide.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
My name is Lawson Smith.
I'm looking for a Walter Xavier.
Oh, lovely boy, but he been gone a long time.
Well, this is the address we have on his sweepstakes form.
Sweepstakes?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm with publishers clearing house.
He win?
- Well, he's a finalist.
- Million dollars.
- And you must be his mother.
- Uh-huh.
Mrs. Miller.
I'm remarried.
Would you have another address or telephone number where I might reach him?
Oh, I'd love to help ya get in touch with Walter.
Bet he could use the money, but...
I don't know where he is.
Walter and me haven't spoke in three years.
Well, if you do talk to him, tell him we got in touch.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have a good day.
Leave a message.
Walter, it's mom.
A guy just come by the house looking for ya.
He's a cop.
On a gut level it doesn't make sense.
The only thing this guy cares about in life is his job.
And you know this, why?
Because he went out to the academy a few times and ran your field exercises?
Listen to me.
Pete Garrison was my best friend...
For 10 years... till he slept with my wife.
So trust me when I tell you, the only thing Pete Garrison cares about is Pete Garrison.
- Yeah?
- Somebody who's not tom dipaola...
Just signed in to our databases using dipaola's password.
Pulled up an address in andrewsboro, Maryland.
I don't believe this.
Get the rest of the team ready.
Let's go.
Walter!
Notify intel we've got a body.
Take the cars around to the other side!
Pete!
Pete!
Damn it.
This is breckinridge.
I'm in a salvage boat at the end of the dock.
- Set up a perimeter now.
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
- Whoa, whoa.
- Secret service.
Get your men to the back of the boat.
Pete, don't move!
Pete!
- The traitor is still out there, Dave.
- Fine.
If that's true, come on in.
We'll protect you.
The only reason that I'm alive is they don't know where I am.
Don't make me do this.
- No way!
- Don't make me do this.
Pete!
You want to shoot me?
Forget about the kevlar.
Shoot me in my face!
Dave!
My buddy!
Come on!
Shoot me!
Come on.
Shoot me.
- What happened?
- I took him down with a shot to the vest.
I couldn't take the second shot.
What's the least contained environment...
The president's going to be in over the next few days?
G8 summit.
Toronto.
It's a nightmare for us.
Canadians are allowing the protestors all the way up to the three perimeter.
The border's not gonna stop him.
It's 3,500 miles long and barely patrolled.
You really think it's him, don't you?
Pete, you scared me!
Nancy, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
What is going on?
What the hell's been happening?
I think Charlie got wind of an assassination plot by one of the other agents...
So I want to check his computer files, see if there's any indication of evidence.
Is that why there's a car watching the house?
The maroon Cadillac.
Who are they?
I think they're the guys that got Charlie.
Nancy, I'm gonna need the keys to your car, and I want you to call the police.
Not the secret service.
The police.
Tell 'em about the Cadillac.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
I was waiting there maybe three hours.
Nobody showed up.
I didn't want to stay there all day.
She didn't go nowhere.
She didn't go nowhere, so I left.
What do you want me to do?
Come on.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
What do you want?
I'm not gonna stay there all night.
She's not gonna be a problem.
No, no.
No.
Yes, yes, by herself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Shooting.
Shooting.
- Huh?
Huh?
- Shooting!
Your name?
Your name!
Who sent you?
Who sent you!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hi, Jill.
- Pete?
Yeah.
Look, I just got into a shootout.
1265 Leslie, northwest.
He's a foreign operative.
He's got a lot of passports and a lot of cash.
He's got full security access to the g8 summit in Toronto tomorrow.
Okay, Pete.
We're on it.
But i really think you should come in.
Yeah.
Pete, we've been through the entire place, but you're gonna have to be straight with me.
- What are you talking about?
- There's no body.
- There's blood all over the goddamn place.
- There's blood all over...
But there's no body, no passports, no g8 credentials.
Listen.
This is not enough to take back to overbrook and clear you.
Dave, I don't know what to tell you.
They're gonna hit him in Toronto, g8 summit.
Pete.
Pete?
Sarah?
Listen, I'm leaving for Toronto tonight.
Montrose wants to move me up there early for security purposes.
Oh!
California.
My sister.
I'll call her back.
Well, this is the speech I'm gonna give.
I'm...
I'm reasonably happy.
Maybe you could take a look at that if you get a chance.
Sure.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll be up after the meeting.
Okay.
Thanks.
One new message.
Sarah, I want you to know if i don't make it, I was doing my job.
I've got to turn this off before they track me.
I love you.
I want you to get the crime scene unit out here immediately.
- Rip this place apart.
- Find me something now.
- This is agent breckinridge.
- Agent breckinridge?
Sarah ballentine.
Come in.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Thanks, tom.
- Could I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you, ma'am.
You know, most women don't like whiskey...
But my mama was from Tennessee.
Pete Garrison and i are having an affair.
Please have a seat.
And... that's for you.
You know, I don't know all the evidence you have against him...
But I do know why he failed the lie detector test.
And I know why he was in that coffee shop looking for someone.
Hello.
U.S. secret service up for the g8.
I got a priority item for the duty officer over at the lab.
That'll be that direction on the eighth floor.
Thank you.
Sign the log, please.
I need any prints that you can find off this cup.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
See you in about 12 minutes.
Sweeps two and three now complete.
I'm gonna be pushing post in a few minutes...
- But if you want to grab a coffee...
- Marin.
- Hey, Jill.
This is Pete.
- A lot of people are looking for you.
I'm sure they are.
- Did you find any prints at the apartment?
- No.
Nothing.
I did.
You gotta help me out.
If I e-mail the prints to you, how long is it gonna take...
To check them against the f.B.I. And c.I.A. Databases?
Five minutes after i receive 'em.
I'll call you five minutes after I send them.
Bye.
I've got a print in here.
Could somebody run it for me, please?
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you.
In my experience a guilty man doesn't break into a police station...
And check fingerprints for a few hours.
What do you think?
My phone was only on for five minutes.
I was in the neighborhood.
Dave, I can't explain about the bank account.
The other things I can explain.
- I know about the affair.
- It wasn't with Cindy.
Oh, I know.
The first lady.
She told me everything.
I know you're being framed.
She showed me the blackmail photos.
So where does that leave us?
- We need to find this guy.
- Come here.
Yeah.
You really are an idiot, you know that?
You honestly thought that this wouldn't be uncovered?
Dave, I love her.
Well, that's practical.
The prints belong to gennady Ivanov, former k.G. B...
Now works for the personal security service for the president of karjastan.
I'm also showing confirmed intel that this is the guy...
Responsible for the central Asian pipeline attacks.
Confirmed intel on what, agent marin?
This is a classified conversation.
We'll be out of here in two minutes.
- Yeah.
Whatever.
- Thank you.
These people have the financial and intelligence resources to pull this off.
All right, let's get going.
We've still gotta find the mole.
We polygraphed every agent with access to the president.
Yours was the only one that showed deception.
We need to figure out how the real traitor passed the test.
Montrose had the list.
You know I never guaranteed you success.
Security's tighter than it's ever been.
Routes, modes of transport, they're all random now.
Yeah, but not random to you, William.
I mean, if you wanted him on that helicopter at camp David, you could have put him there.
Now, you've been playing us since the beginning.
All right.
Fair enough.
That's not gonna work anymore.
- You did make a deal.
- Yeah.
Twenty years ago with the k.G.B., which doesn't even exist anymore.
Do you want out, William?
Then give me... the president.
Just like you agreed.
No.
I don't care.
Expose me.
I don't care if I spend the rest of my life in prison for treason.
I don't care if you kill me.
- Here you go.
- Have a pint.
Oh.
Thank you.
William...
If you don't do this, we're not gonna kill you.
We are going to kill her.
And we're gonna kill her.
And then we're gonna kill her.
Yes, William, the k.G.B.'S gone.
But we're still here.
William, it's all right.
You do have a way out.
But only one.
When he finishes his speech, you take him on the primary route...
To the "b" motorcade under the Plaza...
And you take the radios out.
Then that's it.
And we'll do the rest.
Hey, look.
You can keep those.
I got doubles.
Jill, it's David.
I want you to get in touch with downing and Medina.
Confirm for me which one did montrose's polygraph and get back to me.
- We're on our way to city hall.
- Got it.
Command post from apache follow-up.
Arrive Martinez location 1740 hours.
Copy.
Summon security, dipaola.
Cincinnati's moving to hold.
All posts, all posts, be advised.
We have an arrival.
Only essential traffic at this time.
- Everybody ready?
- Yes, sir.
Let's do this.
Yeah, tell me what you got.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
- You're 100% sure?
Positive.
Polygraphers have no record of montrose even being tested.
- Neither one of them.
- Montrose didn't take the polygraph.
Now let there be no mistake.
In an uncertain and an unsafe world...
America must be strong.
But previous administrations...
I also hacked into merriweather's staff mail.
He was streaming someone's offshore phone logs.
- The logs are montrose's.
- Give me the phone.
Hi, Jill.
It's Pete.
Get a hold of the first lady and tell her... only her... that it's montrose.
Got it.
Jesus Christ, Pete.
The first lady?
What were you thinking?
I never saw it coming, Dave.
Be advised, they just allowed two armed credentialed...
American agents into the three perimeter from checkpoint 386.
Be advised, suspect Garrison has just been let through...
I've got a scope on subject Garrison.
Ah, Jesus!
I got Garrison through the three.
This resolution cannot function alone.
It is designed...
It's Garrison and Breck.
Holster your weapons.
Holster your weapons!
I'm agent breckinridge.
I issued the warrant on Pete Garrison.
Subject in my sight.
Do I take the shot?
We must ratify the Kyoto protocol.
We must embrace the ideal of an African economic union.
Need assistance, over.
- He's a do not admit.
- We have orders.
- I am countermanding your orders!
- You don't control this site.
- Montrose does.
- Don't call him!
- Montrose is the mole!
- Montrose?
What's the procedure for that?
No unauthorized personnel beyond the two perimeter.
Ma'am.
Something's wrong.
My radio just went dead.
I've lost my radio.
I don't have any radio.
- I'm not hearing any chatter.
- I've got silence on all channels.
- It's going down!
- Agent Garrison called on my line.
He wanted me to tell you that montrose is the mole.
But I strongly believe that we can protect our vital interests...
Without causing resentment.
Get your hands in the air!
- Put that down!
- Pete Garrison is not the mole!
- You are a do not admit!
- But at the same time...
- Mr. president.
- Listen to me!
Do not let him move the president!
This way, Mr. president.
- Do not let montrose move the president!
- Montrose, he's getting away!
Crystal.
Crystal is the password.
We need your help.
Tom, get the first lady to the motorcade.
It's all right.
Freeze!
Password is crystal.
Where'd montrose take the president?
- Motorcade "b."
- Stay with me, ma'am.
This way.
- It's just this way, ma'am.
- Tom, where are we going?
We're going to motorcade "c," ma'am.
That's a hell of a way to leave the g8.
What is going on with these goddamn radios?
Go in twos.
What's next, boss?
What's the next move?
- What's next?
- Bill?
Hold the corridor.
Push 'em back.
Crystal!
Pete, we're cut off from the "b" motorcade.
You okay?
- I think so.
- Turn off your locator.
What?
Your locator, turn it off.
That's how they know where we are.
They're tracking us.
How do you... how do you know?
Oh, no, bill.
Oh, god.
Montrose was...
Pete.
Pete.
My family.
My family.
Pete!
Mr. president, you're gonna have to trust us.
We're gonna get you up top to an evac car.
Shooter's at 11:00.
I'll go high.
You go low.
You ready?
- Yeah.
- Go.
Get the president upstairs.
We'll cover you from here.
This way, ma'am.
As quick as you can.
Yes.
Garrison.
Need a hard car for the president at southwest two.
Coming to you, Pete.
Go.
Go!
Go, go!
Southwest stairs.
Let's go get 'em!
All right, we're gonna get you out of here.
Give me a perimeter 10 meters, 360 degrees!
President's hard car!
Let's get him in!
Pete, I got him.
Mr. president, you're with me.
The president is away!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god.
- Secure the first lady!
- We need a hard car, now!
Carl.
Listen, Pete, um...
You take care of yourself.
I'll save you a tee time.
Tom, you did a great job.
I was proud to work with you.
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.
I'll see you guys.
Good careers.
Take care.
Do well, guys.
See you soon.
- Hey, Pete.
- Yeah?
This could be trouble.
I'm gonna walk out of the white house carrying this?
Thanks, guys.
- Bye-bye.
All the best.
- Hey, Pete!
You gonna leave without saying good-bye?
Well, look who's no longer a rookie.
Thanks.
So, how about a little retirement dinner tonight?
I can't.
I got a date.
- Something you want to tell me?
- With my wife.
That's great.
- Pete.
- See you around campus, Jill.
- Thanks for everything.
- Pleasure.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.
It's gonna miss you too.
Take care.
Ted:
Okay where were we?
It was June of 2006,and life had just taken an unexpected turn
Dad,Dad, can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?
I feel like you've been talking for like a year
Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
Could I go to the bathroom?
No.
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.
For me, it started out great
In fact, day one was amazing.
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.
But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your uncle marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his.
marshall:
So that's it?
We're breaking up?
Marshall,I'm sorry.
I just...
I just need to go to san francisco and do this art program and-and figure out who I am outside of us.
And the only way that I can do that is if... if we don't talk for a while.
For a while.
Try never,okay?
You walk out that door,and we're done.
You're never going to hear my voice again.
I should call her.
No,no.
Ted it is-- if you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak and you're going to regret it.
Now,listen,whenever you feel like calling her,you come find me first.
And I will punch you in the face.
You're a good friend,ted.
So,did you hear the big news?
You mean how lily and marshall broke up, and lily's gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night,yeah,I think he knows.
Oh,my god.
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh-- what happened?
Well,she left.
And I don't even know if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message until I woke up.
Bro,I am so sorry.
Thanks.
I know it must be tough, but are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better,but will actively excite you?
Sure.
For the first time,ever,the three of us are single at the same time.
I've dreamed about this day,boys,and it's going to be legendary.
Together,we will own this city.
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends,we'll be there.
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge drinking,we will be there.
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo, sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,"What's up,new york?
" We will be what is up new york.
Gentlemen,we are about to embark on... aw,man,you guys did it,didn't you?
One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning... and love is ending,the first 30 days are remarkably similar.
For one thing,you spend most of your time in bed.
your friends can't stand to listen to you.
He's so ticklish.
It was a really beautiful song.
So... stupid,man.
and you never seem to wear pants.
hey,marshall.
Hey,ted.
You hungry?
What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
Well,at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.
Come on,it's sunday.It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
God,I loved her pancakes.
So soft.
So warm.
So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking about her pancakes?
Come on,you got to eat something; what can I get you?
Beer.
No,that's what you had for dinner.
Fine.
Then I'll just have leftovers.
Barney:
So,he stays home all the time not getting laid?
No,see,that's what you do when you have a fiancé.
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.
He got that redheaded tumor removed.
You should write and illustrate children's books.
You know what marshall needs to do.
He needs to stop being sad.
When I get sad,I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
Anyway,lily's the one who caused this whole mess.
Hey,cut her some slack.She's our friend,too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.
Figure out who she is?
Yeah,she should call me;
I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She'S...
What?
God,your eyes are so blue.
Aw,teddy bear.
oh that's A... yeah,it was hard to feel too bad.
I was dating the woman of my dreams,and things were going great.
Well,for the most part.
So,I found her shampoo.
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells and hope.
Somehow,erotic and comforting all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
Oh,sorry.
Mmm,I thought he'd never go to sleep.
Already?
He's calling her.
I don't hear any-- he's calling her.
No.
Okay,you're right,I won't call her.
I will not call her.
Well,I called her.
And get this,she changed her number.
What,like I'm going to stalk her,or something?
Like she's so special.
Like she's the only lily aldrin out there.
'Cause there are four others in the san francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her based on the brief conversations I had with them.
Does he know I'm in here?
Yeah,hey,robin.
Anyways,one of the lily aldrins said... this has to stop.
Ted,we just started dating.
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,and yet somehow,we have a baby.
He can't feed himself.
He cries a lot,he keeps us up all night.
Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
Look,they were together nine years.
It's only been a month and a half.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
He slept on our floor last night,ted.
He watched a scary movie.
It is time for some tough love.
We need to get him out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
Mmm,sunshine.
Gentlemen,please welcome to the stage,sunshine.
All right,I really don't think this is going to help.
Do you know why you're not over lily yet?
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs; it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with lily'S.
There are a lot of them.
Well,they won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs.
Now,this journey may take as many as a million boobs,so we begin here tonight,my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
This is fun right?
We're outside,it's a beautiful day.
The indians are winning.
I got to admit,it is really nice to be outside.
Yankee fans,please turn your attention to the diamond vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.
Oh,no.
it's all a big lie!
She's just going to break your heart.
you can drag me out of here,but she has no soul!
We've tried everything-- baseball,strippers.
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
See,this is the problem with guys.
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
Oh,and what's your prescription,dr.Estrogen?
Eat haagen-dazs and watch love actually,till your periods sync up.
yeah,that's the stuff.
Oh,my god.
How long have you been doing this?
Well,my dad taught me to me shoot when I was a kid.
Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed,I come here,and it reminds me that... guns are fun.
um,you know,ted is kind of against guns.
And that's why ted's never going to find out about this.
Whoa,that sounded kind of scary with me holding a gun,didn't it?
No,I-I just mean,please don't tell ted.
You want to try?
Only hell yeah.
Oh,yeah,yeah,this is what I needed.
I felt so powerless this whole time,but this... this is power.
This is...
I should of mentioned the recoil.
I got to hand it to you,when he got home,marshall was smiling-- did you sleep with him?
'Cause I was actually,like,three days away from suggesting that.
Sometimes,all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.
yeah,yeah!
Well,congratulations.
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.
You win.
Oh,what do I win?
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.
You are?
That's so nice.
Yeah,my aunt and uncle have a beach house out in montauk,oh,it's really romantic.
My uncle's had like three affairs there.
Wow,must be a nice house,I've seen pictures of your uncle.
This is going to be so great.
We'll finally get some time alone.
Are you sure marshall's going to be okay with this?
Yeah,absolutely.
Dude,I'm doing much better.
In fact,take my car.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey,thanks... and,hey,if you need anything day or night,just call me-- you know what,please don't call me.
What?
What's wrong?
It's,uh,lily's credit card bill.
She must have forgotten to switch her address.
So?
So,I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in san francisco.
No.No,no good can come from looking at this.
You've made too much progress already.
I know but I just,maybe the-- no!
You're going to thank me for this.
You're a good friend,ted.
August 5th,one charge-- tickets.
To what?
George clinton and the p-funk all-stars.
August 10th,one charge:
Tennis emporium.
August 18th,two charges:
Mario's bistro and,get this,pet palace.
You guys see what this means,right?
Wow,mario's bistro.
What a perfect place to whore around.
Only the best for my little lily pad.
Oh,funk legend george clinton,
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert and dragged me onstage to dance with you courtney cox-style.
And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.
You know,marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years, but I didn't do it,because I never truly loved him.
I got you a gift.
A ferret.
Oh,I'll buy it some food next door at the pet palace.
Oh,I've always wanted one,but marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.
It was.
I love you,funk legend george clinton.
I love you,too,lily.
That's right,marshall,she's all mine.
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.
that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah,why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.
Because,robin,they're like fuzzy,tube-shaped rats.
Plus,those charges are from,like,a month ago.
Exactly.
For new charges,you have to go to her online account.
You can see credit card activity from,like,two hours ago.
But,you know,don'T.
Why do you talk?
He needs her password.It's not like he has her password.
Ooh,this is good,he has her password.
There's a charge from earlier today:
The kellett hotel on 5th.
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in new york.
I can't believe this.
Lily's in new york?
I-I guess I've been thinking when she got back,she'd call me.
That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.
This has been "holding it together"?
Okay,you know what?
I'm calling her.
No.
Ted,give me the phone.
You're not calling her,this changes nothing.
You,come here.
Look,while we're away this weekend,can you keep an eye on him,make sure he doesn't call that hotel?
You want me to babysit him?
20 bucks.
An hour.
And money for pizza.
Uh,yeah,how about you do it for free or every time we hang out,you have to watch this?
Come here.
My little blue-eyed baby,baby lips.
Ooh,ooh,sugar,sugar... okay,I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.
Marshall.
Marshall,marshall!
Ted,I know I shouldn't do this,but I have to!
You call her we were together for nine years!
And everything we've been working so hard for is completely flushed down the toi... hello,lily aldrin's room,please.
Thank you.
Hang up now.
Ted,I can't hang up now.
The missiles are in the air,and I know that you don't approve.
Hello.
Uh,a guy answered.
There's-there's a guy in her room.
I'm going down there.
Barney:
Dude,you can't do that.
Have to go down there,and I have to tell her I love her;
I have to beg her to take me back,even if I have to get down on my knees.
Marshall,you can't do that.
Oh,really,why not?
Ted: 56 days.
That's how long it took me to get right about here.
Because you're pathetic!
I'm sorry,but right now,you are not marshall.
You are the miserable,whining,shampoo-sniffing ghost of marshall, and frankly,a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like lily.
You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line?
Marshall.
The real marshall.
But if you go down there right now like this,you're going to blow it for him,and he's never going to forgive you.
Of course,whatever I say,you're just going to do the opposite,so have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.
Come on,robin.
is it still okay if we borrow the car?
Bold.
Bold to go for the car.
What?
I didn't say a thing.
You think I was too hard on him.
I didn't say a thing.
I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.
You're the one who said "tough love.
" Yeah,tough love,not "hand the guy a noose.
" Oh,but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?
Yeah,he told me.
So you're a gun nut?
No,I'm a gun enthusiast.
Do you know how many people are killed each year the second amendment protects my right to bear arms... all right,all right,all right.
I was too hard on him.
A little.
I'm going to call barney,see how they're doing.
go for barney.
Oh,hey,where are you guys?
We're at a fundraiser,helping young women raise money for community college.
Strip club,nice.
Is marshall okay?
yeah,he's here and he's great.Uh,hang on.
Marshall?
Tell ted that--
Already?
What?
What uh-oh?
He's gone.
You lost him?
I can't believe this.He's going to go down to that hotel.
Crap,you're right.
Okay,okay,here's the plan,here's the plan.
You go down to the hotel and find him.
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three.One,two...
barney!
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?
A really nice one.
Hi,uh,could you tell me what room lily aldrin's in?
Marshall.
What happened?
Well,I went up to lily's floor,and I had this little speech in my head-- everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love,loyalty,respect.
I knocked on the door.
So you knocked out lily's new boyfriend?
Yeah.
It wasn't lily's boyfriend.
What?
Who-- who was it?
Ted:
His name was joey adalian,although he went by a number of aliases in his years as an identity thief.
Apparently,earlier in the summer... lily:
Oh,this is so embarrassing.
I-I could have sworn I had some change.
I know,I know.I'm sorry.
Oh,here we go.
No,that's-that's a button.
It was a button.
Do you,uh,take credit cards?
Yes,I do.
So lily's not back in town,and she doesn't have a boyfriend?
Th-that's good news,right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her.
I don't know where she is or what she's doing.
She was my whole life,man,and now she's-she's gone.
You know,first day of college,I showed up,I was so freaked out,and- and I got up to my room,and there was my roommate,lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.
Had headphones on,big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap.
Happy.
Confident.
Not afraid of anything.
That guy was you.
You before you met lily.
Ted?
Yeah?
I was high that day.
I was.
I was so high,I thought you were the dean.
Wh-what I'm saying is there's a version of you without lily,and it's not this.
You can't let lily steal your identity the way that guy stole hers.
Okay.
Okay,resolved.
Starting tomorrow,I'm going to start being okay.
Cheers.
But he wasn't,'cause that's not how life works.
The next day,he found one of her socks or something,and we were back to square one.
And then,one morning... ted,I think you should see this.
Oh,no,what now?
Marshall,what are you doing?
It's sunday.
It's pancakes day.
It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes... so good.
So good.
But marshall had come back from the dead.
Because while baseball,strippers,and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
Ted:
Okay where were we?
It was June of 2006,
And life had just taken an unexpected turn.
Dad, can't you just skip ahead
To the part where you meet mom?
I feel like you've been talking for like a year.
Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
Could I go to the bathroom?
No.
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.
For me, it started out great.
In fact, day one was amazing.
I'd finally gotten together with robin.
But while I'd been off having one of the best nights
Had been having one of the worst nights of his.
♪ Crying in the street...
Marshall:
So that's it?
We're breaking up?
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...
To san francisco and do this art program
And-and figure out who I am outside of us.
And the only way
That I can do that is if...
If we don't talk for a while.
For a while.
Try never, okay?
You walk out that door, and we're done.
You're never going to hear my voice again.
I should call her.
No, no.
Ted, it is...
If you call her
When she asked you not to you're just going to look weak
Now, listen, whenever you feel like calling her,
You come find me first.
And I will punch you in the face.
You're a good friend, ted.
(knock at door)
Hey.
So, did you hear the big news?
You mean how lily and marshall broke up,
And lily's gone and nothing else
Even remotely important happened last night,
Yeah, I think he knows.
Oh, my god.
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh...
What happened?
Well, she left.
And I don't even know if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message until I woke up.
Bro, I am so sorry.
Thanks.
I know it must be tough,
But are you ready to hear something
That will not only make you feel better,
But will actively excite you?
For the first time, ever, the three of us are single
At the same time.
I've dreamed about this day, boys,
And it's going to be
Legendary.
Together, we will own this city.
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends,
We'll be there.
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues
Through promiscuity and binge drinking, we will be there.
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city
In a limo, sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,
(mimicking female voice):
"what's up, new york?"
We will be what is up new york.
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?
Captioningsponsoredby 20thcenturyfoxtelevision
Is that when love is beginning... (moans)
And love is ending,
The first 30 days are remarkably similar.
For one thing, you spend most of your time in bed.
(moans)
(groans)
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.
He's so ticklish.
It was a really beautiful song.
So...
Stupid, man.
(mimicking choking)
And you never seem to wear pants.
(sighs)
Hey, marshall.
Hey, ted.
You hungry?
What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
Well, at least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping.
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
God, I loved her pancakes.
So soft.
So warm.
So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking about her pancakes?
Come on, you got to eat something; what can I get you?
Beer.
No, that's what you had for dinner.
Fine.
Then I'll just have leftovers.
Barney:
So, he stays home
All the time not getting laid?
No, see,
That's what you do when you have a fiancée.
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.
He got that redheaded tumor removed.
You should write and illustrate children's books.
You know what marshall needs to do.
He needs to stop being sad.
When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
Anyway, lily's the one who caused this whole mess.
Hey, cut her some slack.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She's...
What?
God, your eyes are so blue.
Aw, teddy bear.
(mimics sword unsheathing) oh, that's a... (groans)
(coughs)
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.
I was dating the woman of my dreams,
And things were going great.
Well, for the most part.
So, I found her shampoo.
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells and hope.
Somehow,
Erotic and comforting all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
Oh, sorry.
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.
(moans)
Uh-oh.
Already?
He's calling her.
I don't hear any...
He's calling her.
No.
(screams)
Marshall:
Okay, you're right, I won't call her.
I will not call her.
Well, I called her.
And get this,
She changed her number.
What, like I'm going to stalk her,
Or something?
Like she's so special.
Like she's the only lily aldrin out there.
'Cause there are four others in the san francisco area alone,
And they all seem a lot better than her
Based on the brief conversations I had with them.
Does he know I'm in here?
Yeah, hey, robin.
Anyways, one of the lily aldrins said...
This has to stop.
Ted, we just started dating.
We agreed we don't want to move too fast,
And yet somehow, we have a baby.
He can't feed himself.
He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
Look, they were together nine years.
It's only been a month and a half.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
He slept on our floor last night, ted.
He watched a scary movie.
It is time for some tough love.
We need to get him out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
Mmm, sunshine.
Announcer (over speaker):
Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, sunshine.
All right, I really don't think this is going to help.
Do you know why you're not over lily yet?
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer
Picture her boobs;
it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can only store a finite number
Of boob images or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with lily's.
There are a lot of them.
Well, they won't go away until you overwrite them
With images of other women's boobs.
Now, this journey may take
As many as a million boobs,
So we begin here tonight, my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
Yeah.
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.
The indians are winning.
I got to admit,
It is really nice to be outside.
Announcer (over speaker):
Yankee fans,
Please turn your attention to the diamond vision
For a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.
Oh, no.
(crowd sighing)
(applause and cheering)
It's all a big lie!
She's just going to break your heart.
(crowd booing)
You can drag me out of here, but she has no soul!
We've tried everything...
Baseball, strippers.
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
See, this is the problem with guys.
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
Oh, and what's your prescription, dr.
Estrogen?
Eat haagen-dazs and watch love actually,
Till your periods sync up.
(ted, barney laughing)
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Oh, my god.
How long have you been doing this?
Well, my dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid.
Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here,
And it reminds me that...
Guns are fun.
(chuckles lightly)
Um, you know, ted is kind of against guns.
And that's why
Ted's never going to find out about this.
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary
With me holding a gun, didn't it?
No, I-I just mean,
Please don't tell ted.
You want to try?
Only hell yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.
I felt so powerless this whole time,
But this... (laughs)
This is power.
This is...
(gasps)
I should have mentioned the recoil.
I got to hand it to you, when he got home,
Marshall was smiling.
Did you sleep with him?
'Cause I was actually,
Like, three days away from suggesting that.
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch
With your feminine side.
(laughing)
Yeah, yeah!
Well, congratulations.
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.
You win.
Oh, what do I win?
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.
You are?
Mmm.

Wow, must be a nice house.

Are you sure marshall's going to be okay with this?
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.
Oh.
In fact, take my car.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, thanks...
And, hey,
If you need anything day or night, just call me...
You know what, please don't call me.
What?
What's wrong?
It's, uh, lily's credit card bill.
She must have forgotten
To switch her address.
So?
So, I wonder what kind of charges she's making
Out there in san francisco.
No.
No, no good can come from looking at this.
You've made too much progress already.
I know but I just, maybe the... no!
You're going to thank me for this.
You're a good friend, ted.

The only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.

Okay where were we?
It was June of 2006, and life had just taken an unexpected turn.
Dad, can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?
I feel like you've been talking for like a year.
Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
- Could I go to the bathroom?
- No.
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.
For me, it started out great.
In fact, day one was amazing.
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.
But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his.
So that's it?
We're breaking up?
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...
I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and
-and figure out who I am outside of us.
And the only way that I can do that is if... if we don't talk for a while.
For a while.
Try never, okay?
You walk out that door, and we're done.
You're never going to hear my voice again.
I should call her.
- No, No.
- Ted it is--
If you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak and you're going to regret it.
Now, listen, whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first.
And I will punch you in the face.
You're a good friend, Ted.
Hey.
So, did you hear the big news?
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up, and Lily's gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night, yeah, I think he knows.
Oh, my God.
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--
What happened?
Well, she left.
And I don't even know if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message until I woke up.
- Bro, I am so sorry.
- Thanks.
I know it must be tough, but are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better, but will actively excite you?
Sure.
For the first time, ever, the three of us are single at the same time.
I've dreamed about this day, boys, and it's going to be legendary.
Together, we will own this city.
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends, we'll be there.
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge drinking, we will be there.
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo, sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,
"What's up, New York?"
we will be what is up New York.
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?
Sync by vNaru
One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning and love is ending, the first 30 days are remarkably similar.
For one thing, you spend most of your time in bed.
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.
It was a really beautiful song.
So... stupid, man.
And you never seem to wear pants.
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.
You hungry?
What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
Well, at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
God, I loved her pancakes.
So soft.
So warm.
So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking about her pancakes?
Come on, you got to eat something;
what can I get you?
- Beer.
- No, that's what you had for dinner.
Fine.
Then I'll just have leftovers.
So, he stays home all the time not getting laid?
No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée.
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.
He got that redheaded tumor removed.
You should write and illustrate children's books.
You know what Marshall needs to do.
He needs to stop being sad.
When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
Anyway, Lily's the one who caused this whole mess.
Hey, cut her some slack.
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.
Figure out who she is?
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She's...
What?
God, your eyes are so blue.
Teddy Bear.
Oh that's a...
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.
I was dating the woman of my dreams, and things were going great.
Well, for the most part.
So, I found her shampoo.
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells and hope.
Somehow, erotic and comforting all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
Oh, sorry.
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.
- Uh-oh.
- Already?
He's calling her.
- I don't hear any--
- He's calling her.
No.
Okay, you're right, I won't call her.
I will not call her.
Well, I called her.
And get this, she changed her number.
What, like I'm going to stalk her, or something?
Like she's so special.
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.
'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her based on the brief conversations I had with them.
- Does he know I'm in here?
- Yeah, hey, Robin.
- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...
- This has to stop.
Ted, we just started dating.
We agreed we don't want to move too fast, and yet somehow, we have a baby.
He can't feed himself.
- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
- Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
Look, they were together nine years.
It's only been a month and a half.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.
- He watched a scary movie.
- It is time for some tough love.
We need to get him out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
Mmm, sunshine.
Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Sunshine.
All right, I really don't think this is going to help.
Do you know why you're not over Lily yet?
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs;
it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.
There are a lot of them.
Well, they won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs.
Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs, so we begin here tonight, my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
Yeah.
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.
The Indians are winning.
I got to admit, it is really nice to be outside.
Yankee fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special
- seventh-inning-stretch surprise
- Oh, no.
It's all a big lie!
She's just going to break your heart.
You can drag me out of here, but she has no soul!
We've tried everything-- baseball, strippers.
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
See, this is the problem with guys.
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
Oh, and what's your prescription, Dr. Estrogen?
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually, till your periods sync up.
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Oh, my God.
How long have you been doing this?
Well, my dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid.
Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here, and it reminds me that... guns are fun.
Um, you know, Ted is kind of against guns.
And that's why Ted's never going to find out about this.
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary with me holding a gun, didn't it?
No, I-I just mean, please don't tell Ted.
You want to try?
Only hell yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.
I felt so powerless this whole time, but this... this is power.
This is...
I should of mentioned the recoil.
I got to hand it to you, when he got home, Marshall was smiling-- did you sleep with him?
'Cause I was actually, like, three days away from suggesting that.
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.
- Yeah, yeah!
- Well, congratulations.
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.
- You win.
- Oh, what do I win?
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.
You are?
That's so nice.
Yeah, my aunt and uncle have a beach house out in Montauk, oh, it's really romantic.
My uncle's had like three affairs there.
Wow, must be a nice house, I've seen pictures of your uncle.
This is going to be so great.
We'll finally get some time alone.
Are you sure Marshall's going to be okay with this?
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.
In fact, take my car.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, thanks... and, hey, if you need anything day or night, just call me--
You know what, please don't call me.
What?
What's wrong?
It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.
She must have forgotten to switch her address.
So?
So, I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in San Francisco.
No.
No, no good can come from looking at this.
- You've made too much progress already.
- I know but I just, maybe the--
No!
You're going to thank me for this.
You're a good friend, Ted.
August 5th, one charge-- tickets.
To what?
George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars.
August 10th, one charge:
Tennis Emporium.
August 18th, two charges:
Mario's Bistro and, get this, Pet Palace.
You guys see what this means, right?
Wow, Mario's Bistro.
What a perfect place to whore around.
Only the best for my little Lily pad.
Oh, funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert and dragged me on stage to dance with you Courtney Cox-style.
And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.
You know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years, but I didn't do it, because I never truly loved him.
I got you a gift.
Oh !
A ferret.
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace.
Oh, I've always wanted one, but Marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.
It was.
Oh.
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.
I love you, too, Lily.
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.
d Ow, we want the funk. d d Give up the funk... d
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.
Because, Robin, they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.
Plus, those charges are from, like, a month ago.
Exactly.
For new charges, you have to go to her online account.
You can see credit card activity from, like, two hours ago.
But, you know, don't.
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?
!
He needs her password.
It's not like he has her password.
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.
There's a charge from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.
I can't believe this.
Lily's in New York?
I-I guess I've been thinking when she got back, she'd call me.
That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.
This has been "holding it together"?
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.
- No.
- Ted, give me the phone.
You're not calling her, this changes nothing.
You, come here.
Look, while we're away this weekend, can you keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't call that hotel?
You want me to babysit him?
20 bucks.
An hour.
And money for pizza.
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or every time we hang out, you have to watch this?
Come here.
- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.
- Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall!
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this, but I have to!
- You call her...
- We were together...
- for nine years!
- ...and everything we've been working so hard for is completely flushed down the toi...
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.
Thank you.
- Hang up now.
- Ted, I can't hang up now.
- Hang up now.
- The missiles are in the air,
- and I know that you don't approve.
- Hang up.
Hello.
Uh, a guy answered.
There's-there's a guy in her room.
- I'm going down there.
- Dude, you can't do that.
I have to go down there, and I have to tell her I love her;
I have to beg her to take me back, even if I have to get down on my knees.
- Marshall, you can't do that.
- Oh, really, why not?
56 days.
That's how long it took me to get right about here.
Because you're pathetic!
I'm sorry, but right now, you are not Marshall.
You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall, and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.
You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line.
Marshall.
The real Marshall.
But if you go down there right now like this, you're going to blow it for him, and he's never going to forgive you.
Of course, whatever I say, you're just going to do the opposite, so have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.
Come on, Robin.
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?
Bold.
Bold to go for the car.
What?
I didn't say a thing.
You think I was too hard on him.
I didn't say a thing.
I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.
You're the one who said "tough love."
Yeah, tough love, not "hand the guy a noose."
Oh, but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?
Yeah, he told me.
So you're a gun nut?
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.
- Do you know how many people...
- The Second Amendment...
- are killed each year in accidents...
- protects my right to bear arms...
All right, all right, all right.
I was too hard on him.
A little.
I'm going to call Barney, see how they're doing.
Go for Barney.
Oh, hey, where are you guys?
We're at a fundraiser, helping young women raise money for community college.
Strip club, nice.
Is Marshall okay?
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--
Uh-oh.
Already?
What?
What uh-oh?
He's gone.
You lost him?
I can't believe this.
He's gonna go down to that hotel.
Crap, you're right.
Okay, okay, here's the plan, here's the plan.
You go down to the hotel and find him.
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three.
One, two...
Barney!
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?
A really nice one.
Hi, uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in?
Marshall.
Hey.
What happened?
Well, I went up to Lily's floor, and I had this little speech in my head-- everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect.
I knocked on the door.
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?
Yeah.
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.
What?
Who-- who was it?
His name was Joey Adalian, although he went by a number of aliases in his years as an identity thief.
Apparently, earlier in the summer...
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
I-I could have sworn I had some change.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
Oh, here we go.
No, that's-that's a button.
It was a button.
- Do you, uh, take credit cards?
- Yes, I do.
So Lily's not back in town, and she doesn't have a boyfriend?
Th-That's good news, right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her.
I don't know where she is or what she's doing.
She was my whole life, man, and now she's-she's gone.
You know, first day of college, I showed up,
I was so freaked out, and-and I got up to my room, and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.
Had headphones on, big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap.
Happy.
Confident.
Not afraid of anything.
That guy was you.
You before you met Lily.
Ted?
Yeah?
I was high that day.
I was.
I was so high, I thought you were the dean.
Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version of you without Lily, and it's not this.
You can't let Lily steal your identity the way that guy stole hers.
Okay.
Okay, resolved.
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being okay.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
But he wasn't, 'cause that's not how life works.
The next day, he found one of her socks or something, and we were back to square one.
And then, one morning...
Ted, I think you should see this.
Oh, no, what now?
Marshall, what are you doing?
It's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes...
So good.
So good.
...but Marshall had come back from the dead.
Because while baseball, strippers, and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.

Oh, funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert and dragged me on stage to dance with you Courtney Cox-style.
And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.
You know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years, but I didn't do it, because I never truly loved him.
I got you a gift.
Oh !
A ferret.
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace.
Oh, I've always wanted one, but Marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.
It was.
Oh.
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.
I love you, too, Lily.
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.
# Ow, we want the funk. #
# Give up the funk... #
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.
Because, Robin, they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.
Plus, those charges are from, like, a month ago.
Exactly.
For new charges, you have to go to her online account.
You can see credit card activity from, like, two hours ago.
But, you know, don't.
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?
!
He needs her password.
It's not like he has her password.
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.
There's a charge from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.
I can't believe this.
Lily's in New York?
I-I guess I've been thinking when she got back, she'd call me.
That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.
This has been "holding it together"?
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.
- No.
- Ted, give me the phone.
You're not calling her, this changes nothing.
You, come here.
Look, while we're away this weekend, can you keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't call that hotel?
You want me to babysit him?
20 bucks.
An hour.
And money for pizza.
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or every time we hang out, you have to watch this?
Come here.
- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.
- Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall!
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this, but I have to!
- You call her...
- We were together...
- for nine years!
- ...and everything we've been working so hard for is completely flushed down the toi...
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.
Thank you.
- Hang up now.
- Ted, I can't hang up now.
- Hang up now.
- The missiles are in the air,
- and I know that you don't approve.
- Hang up.
Hello.
Uh, a guy answered.
There's-there's a guy in her room.
- I'm going down there.
- Dude, you can't do that.
I have to go down there, and I have to tell her I love her;
I have to beg her to take me back, even if I have to get down on my knees.
- Marshall, you can't do that.
- Oh, really, why not?
56 days.
That's how long it took me to get right about here.
Because you're pathetic!
I'm sorry, but right now, you are not Marshall.
You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall, and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.
You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line.
Marshall.
The real Marshall.
But if you go down there right now like this, you're going to blow it for him, and he's never going to forgive you.
Of course, whatever I say, you're just going to do the opposite, so have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.
Come on, Robin.
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?
Bold.
Bold to go for the car.
What?
I didn't say a thing.
You think I was too hard on him.
I didn't say a thing.
I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.
You're the one who said "tough love."
Yeah, tough love, not "hand the guy a noose."
Oh, but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?
Yeah, he told me.
So you're a gun nut?
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.
- Do you know how many people...
- The Second Amendment...
- are killed each year in accidents...
- protects my right to bear arms...
All right, all right, all right.
I was too hard on him.
A little.
I'm going to call Barney, see how they're doing.
Go for Barney.
Oh, hey, where are you guys?
We're at a fundraiser, helping young women raise money for community college.
Strip club, nice.
Is Marshall okay?
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--
Uh-oh.
Already?
What?
What uh-oh?
He's gone.
You lost him?
I can't believe this.
He's gonna go down to that hotel.
Crap, you're right.
Okay, okay, here's the plan, here's the plan.
You go down to the hotel and find him.
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three.
One, two...
Barney!
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?
A really nice one.
Hi, uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in?
Marshall.
Hey.
What happened?
Well, I went up to Lily's floor, and I had this little speech in my head-- everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect.
I knocked on the door.
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?
Yeah.
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.
What?
Who-- who was it?
His name was Joey Adalian, although he went by a number of aliases in his years as an identity thief.
Apparently, earlier in the summer...
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
I-I could have sworn I had some change.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
Oh, here we go.
No, that's-that's a button.
It was a button.
- Do you, uh, take credit cards?
- Yes, I do.
So Lily's not back in town, and she doesn't have a boyfriend?
Th-That's good news, right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her.
I don't know where she is or what she's doing.
She was my whole life, man, and now she's-she's gone.
You know, first day of college, I showed up,
I was so freaked out, and-and I got up to my room, and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.
Had headphones on, big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap.
Happy.
Confident.
Not afraid of anything.
That guy was you.
You before you met Lily.
Ted?
Yeah?
I was high that day.
I was.
I was so high, I thought you were the dean.
Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version of you without Lily, and it's not this.
You can't let Lily steal your identity the way that guy stole hers.
Okay.
Okay, resolved.
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being okay.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
But he wasn't, 'cause that's not how life works.
The next day, he found one of her socks or something, and we were back to square one.
And then, one morning...
Ted, I think you should see this.
Oh, no, what now?
Marshall, what are you doing?
It's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes...
So good.
So good.
...but Marshall had come back from the dead.
Because while baseball, strippers, and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
# I try to laugh about it #
# Cover it all up with lies #
# I try to laugh about it #
# Hiding the tears from my eyes #
# 'Cause boys don't cry. #
Ted:
Okay where were we?
and life had just taken an unexpected turn can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?
I feel like you've been talking for like a year all this stuff I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
Could I go to the bathroom?
No.
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.
it started out great day one was amazing.
I'd finally gotten together with Robin. your uncle marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his.
marshall:
So that's it?
We're breaking up?
I'm sorry.
I just...
I just need to go to san francisco and do this art program and-and figure out who I am outside of us.
And the only way that I can do that is if... if we don't talk for a while.
For a while.
okay?
and we're done.
You're never going to hear my voice again.
I should call her.
no.
Ted it is-- if you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak and you're going to regret it.
you come find me first.
And I will punch you in the face.
ted.
did you hear the big news? I think he knows.
my god.
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh-- what happened?
she left.
And I don't even know if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message until I woke up.
I am so sorry.
Thanks. but will actively excite you?
Sure.
the three of us are single at the same time.
and it's going to be legendary.
we will own this city.
we'll be there.
we will be there. new york?
We will be what is up new york.
we are about to embark on... didn't you?
One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning... the first 30 days are remarkably similar.
you spend most of your time in bed.
your friends can't stand to listen to you.
He's so ticklish.
It was a really beautiful song.
So... man.
and you never seem to wear pants.
marshall.
ted.
You hungry?
What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.
it's sunday.It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
I loved her pancakes.
So soft.
So warm.
So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking about her pancakes?
you got to eat something; what can I get you?
Beer.
that's what you had for dinner.
Fine.
Then I'll just have leftovers.
he stays home all the time not getting laid?
that's what you do when you have a fiancé.
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.
He got that redheaded tumor removed.
You should write and illustrate children's books.
You know what marshall needs to do.
He needs to stop being sad.
I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
lily's the one who caused this whole mess.
too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.
Figure out who she is?
she should call me;
I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She'S...
What?
your eyes are so blue.
teddy bear.
oh that's A... it was hard to feel too bad.
and things were going great.
for the most part.
I found her shampoo.
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells and hope.
erotic and comforting all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
sorry.
I thought he'd never go to sleep.
Already?
He's calling her.
I don't hear any-- he's calling her.
No.
I won't call her.
I will not call her.
I called her.
she changed her number.
or something?
Like she's so special.
Like she's the only lily aldrin out there. and they all seem a lot better than her based on the brief conversations I had with them.
Does he know I'm in here?
robin.
one of the lily aldrins said... this has to stop.
we just started dating.
we have a baby.
He can't feed himself.
he keeps us up all night.
Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
they were together nine years.
It's only been a month and a half.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
ted.
He watched a scary movie.
It is time for some tough love.
We need to get him out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
sunshine.
sunshine.
I really don't think this is going to help.
Do you know why you're not over lily yet?
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs; it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with lily'S.
There are a lot of them.
they won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs.
my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
This is fun right?
it's a beautiful day.
The indians are winning.
it is really nice to be outside.
please turn your attention to the diamond vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.
no.
it's all a big lie!
She's just going to break your heart.
but she has no soul!
strippers.
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
this is the problem with guys.
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
dr.Estrogen?
till your periods sync up.
that's the stuff.
my god.
How long have you been doing this?
my dad taught me to me shoot when I was a kid.
and it reminds me that... guns are fun.
ted is kind of against guns.
And that's why ted's never going to find out about this.
didn't it?
please don't tell ted.
You want to try?
Only hell yeah.
this is what I needed.
but this... this is power.
This is...
I should of mentioned the recoil.
marshall was smiling-- did you sleep with him?
three days away from suggesting that.
all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.
yeah!
congratulations.
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.
what do I win?
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.
You are?
That's so nice.
it's really romantic.
My uncle's had like three affairs there.
I've seen pictures of your uncle.
This is going to be so great.
We'll finally get some time alone.
Are you sure marshall's going to be okay with this?
absolutely.
I'm doing much better.
take my car.
Really?
Yeah.
thanks... please don't call me.
What?
What's wrong?
lily's credit card bill.
She must have forgotten to switch her address.
So?
I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in san francisco.
no good can come from looking at this.
You've made too much progress already.
maybe the-- no!
You're going to thank me for this.
ted.
one charge-- tickets.
To what?
George clinton and the p-funk all-stars.
one charge:
Tennis emporium.
pet palace.
right?
mario's bistro.
What a perfect place to whore around.
Only the best for my little lily pad.
I am so glad you spotted me at your concert and dragged me onstage to dance with you courtney cox-style.
And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me. because I never truly loved him.
I got you a gift.
A ferret.
I'll buy it some food next door at the pet palace.
but marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.
It was.
funk legend george clinton.
lily.
she's all mine.
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.
that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.
tube-shaped rats.
a month ago.
Exactly.
you have to go to her online account.
two hours ago.
don'T.
Why do you talk?
He needs her password.It's not like he has her password.
he has her password.
There's a charge from earlier today:
The kellett hotel on 5th.
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in new york.
I can't believe this.
Lily's in new york?
she'd call me.
That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.
This has been "holding it together"?

You want me to babysit him?

And money for pizza.

Come here.
sugar...
I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.
Marshall.
marshall!
but I have to!
You call her we were together for nine years!
And everything we've been working so hard for is completely flushed down the toi... please.
Thank you.
I can't hang up now.
and I know that you don't approve.
Hello.
a guy answered.
There's-there's a guy in her room.
I'm going down there.
you can't do that.
and I have to tell her I love her;
even if I have to get down on my knees.
you can't do that.
why not?
Ted: 56 days.
That's how long it took me to get right about here.
Because you're pathetic!
you are not marshall. a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like lily.

But marshall had come back from the dead. the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
Okay where were we?
It was June of 2006, and life had just taken an unexpected turn.
Dad, can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?
I feel like you've been talking for like a year.
Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
- Could I go to the bathroom?
- No.
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.
For me, it started out great.

Try never, okay?
You walk out that door, and we're done.
You're never going to hear my voice again.
I should call her.
- No, No.
- Ted it is--
If you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak and you're going to regret it.
Now, listen, whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first.
And I will punch you in the face.
You're a good friend, Ted.
Hey.
So, did you hear the big news?
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up, and Lily's gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night, yeah, I think he knows.
Oh, my God.
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--
What happened?
Well, she left.
And I don't even know if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message until I woke up.
- Bro, I am so sorry.
- Thanks.
I know it must be tough, but are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better, but will actively excite you?
Sure.
For the first time, ever, the three of us are single at the same time.
I've dreamed about this day, boys, and it's going to be legendary.
Together, we will own this city.
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends, we'll be there.
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge drinking, we will be there.
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo, sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,
"What's up, New York?"
we will be what is up New York.
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?
One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning and love is ending, the first 30 days are remarkably similar.
For one thing, you spend most of your time in bed.
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.
It was a really beautiful song.
So... stupid, man.
And you never seem to wear pants.
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.
You hungry?
What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
Well, at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
God, I loved her pancakes.
So soft.

So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking about her pancakes?
Come on, you got to eat something;

He needs to stop being sad.
When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
Anyway, Lily's the one who caused this whole mess.
Hey, cut her some slack.
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.
Figure out who she is?
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She's...
What?
God, your eyes are so blue.
Teddy Bear.
Oh that's a...
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.
I was dating the woman of my dreams, and things were going great.
Well, for the most part.
So, I found her shampoo.
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells and hope.
Somehow, erotic and comforting all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
Oh, sorry.
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.
- Uh-oh.
- Already?
He's calling her.
- I don't hear any--
- He's calling her.
No.
Okay, you're right, I won't call her.
I will not call her.
Well, I called her.
And get this, she changed her number.
What, like I'm going to stalk her, or something?
Like she's so special.
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.
'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her based on the brief conversations I had with them.
- Does he know I'm in here?
- Yeah, hey, Robin.
- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...
- This has to stop.
Ted, we just started dating.
We agreed we don't want to move too fast, and yet somehow, we have a baby.
He can't feed himself.
- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
- Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
Look, they were together nine years.
It's only been a month and a half.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.
- He watched a scary movie.
- It is time for some tough love.
We need to get him out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
Mmm, sunshine.
Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Sunshine.
All right, I really don't think this is going to help.
Do you know why you're not over Lily yet?
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs;
it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.
There are a lot of them.
Well, they won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs.
Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs, so we begin here tonight, my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
Yeah.
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.
The Indians are winning.
I got to admit, it is really nice to be outside.
Yankee fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special
- seventh-inning-stretch surprise
- Oh, no.
It's all a big lie!
She's just going to break your heart.
You can drag me out of here, but she has no soul!
We've tried everything-- baseball, strippers.
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
See, this is the problem with guys.
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
Oh, and what's your prescription, Dr. Estrogen?
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually, till your periods sync up.
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Oh, my God.
How long have you been doing this?
Well, my dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid.
Whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here, and it reminds me that... guns are fun.
Um, you know, Ted is kind of against guns.
And that's why Ted's never going to find out about this.
Whoa, that sounded kind of scary with me holding a gun, didn't it?
No, I-I just mean, please don't tell Ted.
You want to try?
Only hell yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is what I needed.
I felt so powerless this whole time, but this... this is power.
This is...
I should of mentioned the recoil.
I got to hand it to you, when he got home, Marshall was smiling-- did you sleep with him?
'Cause I was actually, like, three days away from suggesting that.
Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side.
- Yeah, yeah!
- Well, congratulations.
You're the first person to cheer him up all summer.
- You win.
- Oh, what do I win?
I'll tell you what you win:
I'm taking you away this weekend.
You are?
That's so nice.
Yeah, my aunt and uncle have a beach house out in Montauk, oh, it's really romantic.
My uncle's had like three affairs there.
Wow, must be a nice house, I've seen pictures of your uncle.
This is going to be so great.
We'll finally get some time alone.
Are you sure Marshall's going to be okay with this?
Yeah, absolutely.
Dude, I'm doing much better.
In fact, take my car.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, thanks... and, hey, if you need anything day or night, just call me--
You know what, please don't call me.
What?
What's wrong?
It's, uh, Lily's credit card bill.
She must have forgotten to switch her address.
So?
So, I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there in San Francisco.
No.
No, no good can come from looking at this.
- You've made too much progress already.
- I know but I just, maybe the--
No!
You're going to thank me for this.
You're a good friend, Ted.
August 5th, one charge-- tickets.
To what?
George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars.
August 10th, one charge:
Tennis Emporium.
August 18th, two charges:
Mario's Bistro and, get this, Pet Palace.
You guys see what this means, right?
Wow, Mario's Bistro.
What a perfect place to whore around.
Only the best for my little Lily pad.
Oh, funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert and dragged me on stage to dance with you Courtney Cox-style.
And I'm so glad you agreed to play tennis with me.
You know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years, but I didn't do it, because I never truly loved him.
I got you a gift.
Oh !
A ferret.
Oh, I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace.
Oh, I've always wanted one, but Marshall had this secret phobia of ferrets.
I bet that's something he made you promise not to tell nobody.
It was.
Oh.
I love you, funk legend George Clinton.
I love you, too, Lily.
That's right, Marshall, she's all mine.
Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair.
# Ow, we want the funk. #
# Give up the funk... #
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
Yeah, why are you afraid of ferrets?
They're adorable.
Because, Robin, they're like fuzzy, tube-shaped rats.
Plus, those charges are from, like, a month ago.
Exactly.
For new charges, you have to go to her online account.
You can see credit card activity from, like, two hours ago.
But, you know, don't.
Why do you talk?
Why do you talk?
!
He needs her password.
It's not like he has her password.
Ooh, this is good, he has her password.
There's a charge from earlier today:
the Kellett Hotel on 5th.
I don't believe this.
Lily's back in New York.
I can't believe this.
Lily's in New York?
I-I guess I've been thinking when she got back, she'd call me.
That's really the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.
This has been "holding it together"?
Okay, you know what?
I'm calling her.
- No.
- Ted, give me the phone.
You're not calling her, this changes nothing.
You, come here.
Look, while we're away this weekend, can you keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't call that hotel?
You want me to babysit him?
20 bucks.
An hour.
And money for pizza.
Uh, yeah, how about you do it for free or every time we hang out, you have to watch this?
Come here.
- My little blue-eyed baby, baby lips.
- Ooh, ooh, sugar, sugar...
Okay, I'll do it!
Stop being a couple.
- Marshall.
- Marshall, Marshall!
Ted, I know I shouldn't do this, but I have to!
- You call her...
- We were together...
- for nine years!
- ...and everything we've been working so hard for is completely flushed down the toi...
Hello, Lily Aldrin's room, please.
Thank you.
- Hang up now.
- Ted, I can't hang up now.
- Hang up now.
- The missiles are in the air,
- and I know that you don't approve.
- Hang up.
Hello.
Uh, a guy answered.
There's-there's a guy in her room.
- I'm going down there.
- Dude, you can't do that.
I have to go down there, and I have to tell her I love her;
I have to beg her to take me back, even if I have to get down on my knees.
- Marshall, you can't do that.
- Oh, really, why not?
56 days.
That's how long it took me to get right about here.
Because you're pathetic!
I'm sorry, but right now, you are not Marshall.
You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall, and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily.
You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line.
Marshall.
The real Marshall.
But if you go down there right now like this, you're going to blow it for him, and he's never going to forgive you.
Of course, whatever I say, you're just going to do the opposite, so have a great weekend.
Good luck screwing up your life.
Come on, Robin.
Is it still okay if we borrow the car?
Bold.
Bold to go for the car.
What?
I didn't say a thing.
You think I was too hard on him.
I didn't say a thing.
I can't believe you're accusing me of being too hard on him.
You're the one who said "tough love."
Yeah, tough love, not "hand the guy a noose."
Oh, but it's okay to hand him a nine millimeter?
Yeah, he told me.
So you're a gun nut?
No, I'm a gun enthusiast.
- Do you know how many people...
- The Second Amendment...
- are killed each year in accidents...
- protects my right to bear arms...
All right, all right, all right.
I was too hard on him.
A little.
I'm going to call Barney, see how they're doing.
Go for Barney.
Oh, hey, where are you guys?
We're at a fundraiser, helping young women raise money for community college.
Strip club, nice.
Is Marshall okay?
Yeah, he's here and he's great.
Uh, hang on.
Marshall?
Tell Ted that--
Uh-oh.
Already?
What?
What uh-oh?
He's gone.
You lost him?
I can't believe this.
He's gonna go down to that hotel.
Crap, you're right.
Okay, okay, here's the plan, here's the plan.
You go down to the hotel and find him.
I'll stay here and get a lap dance.
On three.
One, two...
Barney!
Was there a hot tub at your uncle's place?
A really nice one.
Hi, uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in?
Marshall.
Hey.
What happened?
Well, I went up to Lily's floor, and I had this little speech in my head-- everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect.
I knocked on the door.
So you knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?
Yeah.
It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.
What?
Who-- who was it?
His name was Joey Adalian, although he went by a number of aliases in his years as an identity thief.
Apparently, earlier in the summer...
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
I-I could have sworn I had some change.
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
Oh, here we go.
No, that's-that's a button.
It was a button.
- Do you, uh, take credit cards?
- Yes, I do.
So Lily's not back in town, and she doesn't have a boyfriend?
Th-That's good news, right?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her.
I don't know where she is or what she's doing.
She was my whole life, man, and now she's-she's gone.
You know, first day of college, I showed up,
I was so freaked out, and-and I got up to my room, and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall.
Had headphones on, big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap.
Happy.
Confident.
Not afraid of anything.
That guy was you.
You before you met Lily.
Ted?
Yeah?
I was high that day.
I was.
I was so high, I thought you were the dean.
Wh-What I'm saying is there's a version of you without Lily, and it's not this.
You can't let Lily steal your identity the way that guy stole hers.
Okay.
Okay, resolved.
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being okay.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
But he wasn't, 'cause that's not how life works.
The next day, he found one of her socks or something, and we were back to square one.
And then, one morning...
Ted, I think you should see this.
Oh, no, what now?
Marshall, what are you doing?
It's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes...
So good.
So good.
...but Marshall had come back from the dead.
Because while baseball, strippers, and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.
# I try to laugh about it #
# Cover it all up with lies #
# I try to laugh about it #
# Hiding the tears from my eyes #
# 'Cause boys don't cry. #
Okay where were we?
It was June of 2006, and life had just taken an unexpected turn.
Dad, can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?
I feel like you've been talking for like a year.
Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.
It's all part of the story.
- Could I go to the bathroom?
- No.
The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.
For me, it started out great.
In fact, day one was amazing.
I'd finally gotten together with Robin.
But while I'd been off having one of the best nights of my life, your uncle Marshall had been having one of the worst nights of his.
So that's it?
We're breaking up?
Marshall, I'm sorry.
I just...
I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and
-and figure out who I am outside of us.
And the only way that I can do that is if... if we don't talk for a while.
For a while.
Try never, okay?
You walk out that door, and we're done.
You're never going to hear my voice again.
I should call her.
- No, No.
- Ted it is--
If you call her when she asked you not to you're just going to look weak and you're going to regret it.
Now, listen, whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first.
And I will punch you in the face.
You're a good friend, Ted.
Hey.
So, did you hear the big news?
You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up, and Lily's gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night, yeah, I think he knows.
Oh, my God.
I-I'm so sorry.
Wh--
What happened?
Well, she left.
And I don't even know if she's coming back.
I didn't get your message until I woke up.
- Bro, I am so sorry.
- Thanks.
I know it must be tough, but are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better, but will actively excite you?
Sure.
For the first time, ever, the three of us are single at the same time.
I've dreamed about this day, boys, and it's going to be legendary.
Together, we will own this city.
Anytime a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriends, we'll be there.
Anytime a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge drinking, we will be there.
Anytime a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo, sticking their heads out the sunroof shouting,
"What's up, New York?"
we will be what is up New York.
Gentlemen, we are about to embark on...
Aw, man, you guys did it, didn't you?
One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning and love is ending, the first 30 days are remarkably similar.
For one thing, you spend most of your time in bed.
Your friends can't stand to listen to you.
It was a really beautiful song.
So... stupid, man.
And you never seem to wear pants.
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey, Ted.
You hungry?
What's the point?
I could eat some food.
It's just going to leave me.
Well, at least in that scenario you get to do the dumping.
Come on, it's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
Lily always made the pancakes.
God, I loved her pancakes.
So soft.
So warm.
So perfectly shaped.
Are we still talking about her pancakes?
Come on, you got to eat something;
what can I get you?
- Beer.
- No, that's what you had for dinner.
Fine.
Then I'll just have leftovers.
So, he stays home all the time not getting laid?
No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée.
He should be down here celebrating.
He's free.
He got that redheaded tumor removed.
You should write and illustrate children's books.
You know what Marshall needs to do.
He needs to stop being sad.
When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
True story.
It's only been a month.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
Anyway, Lily's the one who caused this whole mess.
Hey, cut her some slack.
She's our friend, too.
She's just trying to figure out who she is.
Figure out who she is?
Yeah, she should call me;
I got a whole list.
She's selfish.
She's immature.
She's...
What?
God, your eyes are so blue.
Teddy Bear.
Oh that's a...
Yeah, it was hard to feel too bad.
I was dating the woman of my dreams, and things were going great.
Well, for the most part.
So, I found her shampoo.
I guess she left it here.
It smells like her.
Like lavender and seashells and hope.
Somehow, erotic and comforting all at the same time.
That's my shampoo.
Oh, sorry.
Mmm, I thought he'd never go to sleep.
- Uh-oh.
- Already?
He's calling her.
- I don't hear any--
- He's calling her.
No.
Okay, you're right, I won't call her.
I will not call her.
Well, I called her.
And get this, she changed her number.
What, like I'm going to stalk her, or something?
Like she's so special.
Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there.
'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her based on the brief conversations I had with them.
- Does he know I'm in here?
- Yeah, hey, Robin.
- Anyways, one of the Lily Aldrins said...
- This has to stop.
Ted, we just started dating.
We agreed we don't want to move too fast, and yet somehow, we have a baby.
He can't feed himself.
- He cries a lot, he keeps us up all night.
- Have you tried breast-feeding?
Nailed it!
Look, they were together nine years.
It's only been a month and a half.
He just needs to go at his own pace.
He slept on our floor last night, Ted.
- He watched a scary movie.
- It is time for some tough love.
We need to get him out of that apartment.
He needs fresh air.
He needs sunshine.
Mmm, sunshine.
Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Sunshine.
All right, I really don't think this is going to help.
Do you know why you're not over Lily yet?
It's 'cause you can still picture her naked.
You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs;
it's a scientific fact.
The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images or "b-pegs".
And your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.
There are a lot of them.
Well, they won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs.
Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs, so we begin here tonight, my friend.
Two at a time.
Those count as four.
Yeah.
This is fun right?
We're outside, it's a beautiful day.
The Indians are winning.
I got to admit, it is really nice to be outside.
Yankee fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special
- seventh-inning-stretch surprise
- Oh, no.
It's all a big lie!
She's just going to break your heart.
You can drag me out of here, but she has no soul!
We've tried everything-- baseball, strippers.
The guy still won't eat a damn pancake.
I think he's beyond repair.
See, this is the problem with guys.
You don't know how to deal with heartbreak.
Oh, and what's your prescription, Dr. Estrogen?
Eat Haagen-Dazs and watch Love Actually, till your periods sync up.
Yeah, that's the stuff.

The next day, he found one of her socks or something, and we were back to square one.
And then, one morning...
Ted, I think you should see this.
Oh, no, what now?
Marshall, what are you doing?
It's Sunday.
It's pancakes day.
It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes...
So good.
So good.
...but Marshall had come back from the dead.
Because while baseball, strippers, and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time.

?
andI believe that there is no higher calling thanthatof publicservice.
And where others see the State Senate as a steppingstone to higher office, let me assure you,
I can see no greater service to the people I love.
OPERATOR:
911.
What's your emergency?
There's a man with a gun at the Quincy Hotel.
...making California safe to threats from without and within.
Hey, Bill.
Don.
Thanks for coming, guys.
Chippies are stretched thin today.
We could use more eyes out there.
So what's the deal?
Why's the Senator still here with a death threat?
He wouldn't let us pull him out.
COLBY:
So we have absolutely no control over who's already been let in.
Let's get the uplink to my people.
Why don't you guys hit the floor.
?
SENATOR:
...by a series of reforms designed to overturn 30 years of misguided optimism about the heart of a criminal and what resides there.
Thank you.
God bless you all and God bless the great state of California.
All right, guys, here comes the uplink.
Now.
I'm up.
Yeah, so are we.
I've been waiting for an opportunity to give my crowd dynamics program a shakedown.
Look, if this works, the security applications alone are staggering
It's amazing.
We're getting a real-time analysis of movement patterns, ongoing flow rate projections.
We're looking for a male, one male, probably with a handgun.
Lot of people in the area.
Hope you guys can narrow it down.
I'm fishing for body language and microexpressions, but with this many people, it's really just fishing.
Charlie?
Look, the software we're using is designed to determine corridor flow, maximize efficiency of ingress and egress.
You know, but what's really interesting here are the continuum approximations.
By analyzing the crowd as if it were a liquid-like substance...
We're looking for anomalies, like someone breaking the pattern of the reception line.
...fast and close for a shot at the senator.
Do you see that?
All right, we'd better double-check it against high-density, bidirectional flow results.
MEGAN:
Charlie, there's a time for double-checking and a time to make an educated guess.
Okay, then, we have an unaccountable congestion near a center table.
I have a male Asian, 60s, near the center table.
The body language is right.
He has slumped shoulders and a slack expression.
He's holding his jacket with his right hand.
?
Two o'clock, two o'clock.
I got him.
FBI!
Get down!
Move!
?
?
Put it down!
Put it down!
Right now!
Don't do that!
Don't do it!

FRM@FadeOut Sync:
FRM@L.P.Prince
Vanh Minh, former Vietnamese citizen.
Joined the Vietcong at age 15, eventually became a recon platoon leader in Dinh Tuong.
Senator Tallman was in the Army, right?
In the '60s?
Never went to Vietnam.
Never even went overseas.
As far as we can tell, these two men never even met each other.
All right, so this guy disappears in '68, resurfaces in '78... as a US citizen?
Wait, how's he pull that off?
He's not a registered voter.
He has no political affiliation whatsoever.
I mean, it looks like a... classic lone gunman.
Yeah, but why kill a politician you don't even know?
Doesn't make any damn sense.
Landlord says that Minh paid his rent on time and kept to himself and fixed his own faucet.
Yep, and he kept a diary.
All in French, so I think we're gonna need a translator.
He planned this thing out in advance.
He bought the suit, the tie, and the shoes a week ago.
Even had time to get the pants taken in.
Well, careful prep is consistent with the murder-suicide.
"Brutus climbed into my mind and stopped me from functioning as a normal person."
Wow, she speaks French.
She dated a hockey player.
"Before Brutus, I was curious and intelligent."
You know, Brutus could be a code word for Tallman.
Yeah.
Did he happen to mention what he had against this guy?
He might not have had a specific grudge.
He's showing manifestations of schizophrenia.
Non-existent relationships, repressed rage.
And medication.
Nice grab.
:
Thanks.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.
That's speed.
Well, abuse would explain high levels of aggression.
Yep.
Answers a lot of questions.
Yeah, and begs a few more like who prescribed this and for what.
Yeah.
Also, why was he receiving pension checks from the Army?
The United States Army.
?
Oh, thanks again for use of your address, Charles.
Since the steam tunnels,
Professor Mildred has cut off all use of my faculty mailboxes.
And the... the magazine.
Charles.
Yeah.
I-I believe this is my copy of the Quarterly Review of Cosmology.
Yeah, it is.
Why are we engaged in combat over it?
Well, be-
- I'll tell-- because--
There's, there's something on the cover that may very well, um-- no, it is,it is going to upset you.
I was going to throw it out, and then I figured you'd find it sooner or later.
Just give it to me already.
"Igby's Law Redefines Gravity Flux Motivated by Sound Wave Propagation in Bose-Einstein Condensates."
Professor Johannes Igby?
Um, I know you publicly disputed Igby's approach.
The man is an anthropic imbecile.
You know, so what i-if, if he's been proven right?
He's had a law named after him.
So what if he's been put on the short list for the National Medal of Science Award?
He has?
It's on page 87.
So look, I mean, it, it may sting a little bit, you know, at first, but, um...
You're smiling.
I am?
Are you, are you in stunned shock?
It's okay.
I'll call the campus medic.
Actually, don't do that.
Tell you what you can do.
Take over my Computational Physics class.
Well, the last time I covered that class, one of your students...
Thank you so much, Charles.
911.
MAN:
There is a man with a gun at the Quincy Hotel.
Can I have your name?
He is going to kill Senator Martin Tallman.
It may already be too late.
No, I mean, he doesn't sound 60 and he doesn't sound Vietnamese.
No.
Voice recognition says male, Caucasian, 25 to 40.
And that call came in at 12:17 from a pay phone in the lobby.
By that time, Minh was already in the ballroom.
Autopsy results are in.
Death from a gunshot wound to Minh's head.
We need an autopsy to tell us that?
I was actually more interested in the pathology.
ME confirmed
Minh had been taking large doses of dextroamphetamine sulfate.
That prescription was written on a stolen pad.
Which suggests intentional abuse.
It's like he was getting himself angry enough to kill Tallman.
Did you get anywhere with the pension checks?
No, the VA had no records on him, so I pulled in a favor who's pulling in a favor.
And your favor's favor called me.
Agent Eppes.
Raymond, Central Intelligence.
We need to talk.
?
Let's take a little walk.
We'd be interested in doing an information share on the Tallman assassination.
Uh-huh.
Why are you guys so interested in a California State Senator?
Vanh Minh's citizenship and pension were functions of work he performed for us during Vietnam.
What, double agent?
I couldn't say.
Well, see, you know, as file-sharing goes, we're off to a bad start here.
I mean...
What I mean is I don't know.
Minh was part of a defunct program from a war we lost 30 years ago.
So what are you saying?
The guy was in the wind for 25 years?
And now he's front page news.
And I'd like to know what kind of damage control we're looking at.
No chest beating, just a request to keep a colleague in the loop.
All right, fair enough.
Thanks.
Minh's .38 was one of three purchased at a Nevada gun store last month.
Buyer used a stolen ID.
The store's name is Longan Ammo.
On the ATF's watch list.
Have a reputation for playing things a little fast and loose when it comes to background checks and waiting periods.
We got a straw purchase.
Yeah, then he sold it off to Minh.
What do we got?
A white male, 30s.
You really think we have some kind of conspiracy going on?
I don't know.
I think we'd better find those other two guns.
?
sends a buyer into a gun store.
Right, in this case, with a fake ID.
And the buyer purchases multiple guns legally...
Mm-hmm.
And then returns them to the dealer?
Yeah, it's called a straw purchase.
Gun stores can do that?
Just sell pistols to anyone with money?
They're not supposed to, but these people can find a way to make a buck.
I know what you're thinking.
An inductive application of the network effect.
Starting from Metcalfe's law?
No, you know how I feel about Metcalfe's law.
You know, it's value- based, so in my opinion, it just, it vastly overst...
BOTH:
Hi.
Can we come in?
This is perfect.
Where's Alan?
He's in Oakland until Monday.
Yeah, he's, he's over there consulting on a waterfront renovation project...
LARRY:
Um...
I think maybe we should wait.
No, we can't wait.
Wait for what?
Um, Larry has some really big news.
I'm leaving Cal Sci.
I'm leaving Los Angeles in fact, more specifically,
I will be leaving the planet Earth, though I will remain in orbit...
Okay.
If you don't tell them, I'm going to.
I will be on the next shuttle to the International Space Station leaving roughly three weeks from now.
You are not...
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, hold on.
What?
You must have suspected something.
I mean with my unorthodox living situations, my unexplained absences.
I thought that was you being...
You.
No.
And you knew about this?
Well, I knew he was taking more trips to Houston.
But no, I never pierced the "veil of mystery."
Yes, I guess my work in the cosmic microwave background had some relevance to the NSA's satellite signals technology and, uh, they contacted me last September.
Last September?
Yes.
Handshakes transpired, oaths were taken and the long and the short of it is that I was made alternate payload specialist.
He's going on the space shuttle for six months.
Wow.
Why didn't you ever say anything?
Because it was always just such a long shot, but with the recent good fortune of the original payload specialist, Johannes Igby,
Igby's Law.
his new responsibilities sadly prevent him from taking his seat on the shuttle.
So, so T-Minus?
Um, we're scheduled for departure on the 7th.
I will be leaving for Houston next week for final training and my flight physical.
Larry's got the right stuff.
All right, I'm getting some champagne.
Congratulations, Larry.
Oh, thank you.
?
So why Chicago?
Do not know.
Go ask my publisher.
I think you've got a girl there.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Girl in every port.
Mmm.
To a girl in every port.
Can I help you?
No, Stan!
Stan.?
Male, Hispanic, 40s.
The guy walks up to this table, puts five shots into the victim, turns the gun on himself, misfires, walks away.
Sounds a lot like the Tallman shooting.
LAPD detective made the same connection.
So they checked the serial number against our straw purchase.
Do we have a match?
Yeah, you think I'm going to call you out here, on your night off if we don't?
Victim is Stanford Davis.
This is his wife.
He's a psychiatrist.
Just wrote a book called New Methods of Operant Conditioning andItsImpactonNeuroanatomy.
I'll wait for the movie.
Yeah.
One gun purchase has given us two execution-style murders.
And one and a half suicides.
You used Metcalfe's Law after all.
You know, no one likes to hear "I told you so." Okay.
What are those?
It's a second gun from a shooting last night.
I'm tracing the past patterns of transactions across the network and it's-it's revealing some very predictable dynamics.
It's really something-- about Larry.
What, the whole, uh... space station thing?
Yeah, you seemed a little, uh...
A little what?
I don't know... upset?
Upset?
What do you mean?
No, I'm-I'm upset?
Of course not.
I'm not upset.
I mean maybe I would be if I thought he was actually going to go through with it.
Larry asked Dr. Finch for a leave of absence.
I mean he put his car in storage.
I have known Larry Fleinhardt for 15 years.
He's not going anywhere.
I think you should talk to him.
Why?
There's nothing to talk about.
Besides I've got to present my findings to Don, so...
Shooter left a pretty good print on the strap.
It comes back to...
Carlos Costavo.
He came to the US from Cuba with the 1980 Marielito exodus.
All right, so political refugee or a criminal?
No, he's definitely a criminal.
He got here, spent ten years at Chino for robbery and assault.
Costavo.
He hasn't been home in three days.
But we did find government pension checks and dextroamphetamine sulfate.
Same as Minh.
Yeah.
Something really strange is going on here.
?
Senator, psychiatrist, a Vietnamese POW, a Cuban refugee.
And the guns.
Right.
Well, looks like I'm right on time.
?
a list of gun sales from Longan Ammo, going back about two years and the suspected straw purchases are here in red.
And this is ATF's list of suspected street-level gun dealers and their sales patterns.
Now, what I did was I applied networking theory to a directed graph, using the source and known nodes to determine the sink.
Which is kind of like...
Kind of like... kind of like, oh, kind of like a telephone, which is actually the classic example of networking.
Okay, so we have stores and purchasers, dealers and buyers.
They're all part of the same network.
Right.
Now, what I did was study the call patterns, the straw purchases and I listened for the ringing telephone.
Now, I'm going to call a bullpen extension right now;
and how about you guys tell me which one I'm calling.
Oh, it could be about half a dozen phones right now.
So we've already narrowed down the possibilities considerably.
The more calls
I make... the easier it becomes to find the right one.
Hello.
Yeah, sorry, I'm just demonstrating networking theory.
She hung up.
So... the ringing phone we're looking for is the black market dealer, who bought the three guns.
I was actually looking for patterns of distribution, arrests that connect to straw sales according to time and proximity, not to mention the kind of weapons transacted.
Now by looking at the way that Longan Ammo made straw gun sales and then the appearance of the guns on the street...
You came up with a name.
Off of Senator
Tallman's shooting, I came up with four names, and given the second shooting,
I was able to narrow it down:
Sam Finney, a major gun dealer.
FBI.
You're under arrest.
FBI?
What'd I do to you guys?
You picked up the wrong phone.
?
RPGs... if you do time by the bullet, you got some problems here.
Yeah.
And you can make them all go away, right?
Nah,
I think that would take like a presidential pardon.
But I'll tell you something, Sam, you help me, maybe I get it down to five to ten.
I won't wear a wire.
Three Smith Wesson Model 64s, bought in Nevada last month.
Longan Ammo.
Guy runs the place like he's selling socks...
Get your hands back on the table.
Where'd they end up?
Some guy.
Guy.
All right, Sam.
Marcus.
All right, his name was Marcus.
Tried to move him up to Glocks, but he said he wanted to keep it simple.
Did he say what he wanted them for?
Yeah, they're a little expensive for paperweights, you know what I mean?
Yeah, that's funny.
I didn't ask.
That's it?
That's what you got for me?
Brown hair, blue eyes, 40, maybe 45.
Real quiet, talked like he was in a library.
All right, sit tight.
Keep your hands on the table.
Yeah, right.
Problem with these Identikit pictures, they're only as good as the description.
And Finney's wasn't great.
Hey, it's what we got, you know.
Okay, Stanford Davis was a prison psychologist at Chino from 1983 to 1985.
Wait, Costavo was there from 1981 to 1991, so, so they knew each other.
Yeah, and here's a little-known fact about the California Penal system:
they have a long and proud history of experimenting on prisoners.
And, uh, pharmaceutical companies test on inmates.
Yeah, but that's voluntarily, and in pretty limited circumstances.
I'm talking about behavior modification programs, sensory deprivation, chemical treatment, psychosurgery, many of which are underwritten by the Department of Defense, where the CIA friend came.
Including one "Brutus Project,"
which Davis worked on.
The same Brutus as in Minh's journal?
And the same Davis as in the shrink who was our second victim.
Julius Caesar's assassin's full name was Marcus Brutus.
Finney said he sold guns to a guy named Marcus.
So, now we've connected
Costavo to Davis, possibly to Minh.
Guess which State Senator has been pushing legislation through a repeal to ban on prison testing?
Uh, Tallman.
A equals B equals
C equals D; it's like one of Charlie's equations.
Can't believe I just said that.
Spring cleaning?
No.
As per Dr. Finch's request, I have now thoroughly vacated my lair.
I do take some comfort however, in remanding my few prized possessions into the custody of my closest friend.
Aw, well, thanks.
What do we got in here?
Oh, wow, the Newton Lacy Award.
My goodness.
Uh...
Of course, uh, some jazz recordings.
Of course.
An old... yeah, an old T-shirt.
Old T-shirt, worn on the day I first posited causal solutions to ultrahyperbolic wave equations and more memorably, when I vanquished Professor Musgrave at the Cal Sci's Texas Hold 'Em tournament.
Wow, then this is one lucky shirt.
Yeah, well, not to dwell on the negatives.
I am mindful of the risk involved in sitting atop two million liters of combusted liquid hydrogen and oxygen.
Larry.
Do you remember... when I was in my junior year and, uh, I decided to grow my moustache out?
The word "moustache" would be a charitable characterization.
You said that my follicle count failed to achieve critical mass.
That's... dear... sorry.
No, you were being brutally honest with me, you know.
And sometimes friends have to be brutally honest with each other.
Larry... you know this thing isn't really going to happen.
Because?
People die in space shuttles, Larry.
You know and at some point you're going to make a rational assessment of this situation.
You're going to realize that shooting yourself out of a cannon would just be feckless waste.
Let me get this right.
You are actually comparing my brushing the heavens with your barely postpubescent moustache.
No, I'm just being realistic.
It's a very fortunate thing for you that I am on the verge of fulfilling one of life's dreams.
Fortunate for me?
That's correct.
Because were I in a less ebullient frame of mind,
I might well just bop you in the nose.
Excuse me.
Have you ever heard of MK-ULTRA?
What, that's a CIA program in the, what, '50s.
LSD, mind control...
Right, right, LSD was part of it.
But they tried sensory deprivation, radiation, ELF.
Uh-huh.
What's that?
Extreme Low Frequency.
Certain pulses can actually affect a subject's emotional state.
MK-ULTRA was one of many programs.
Right, like Brutus?
The idea was to program enemy agents with posthypnotic suggestions, then send them home as sleeper assassins.
Assassins.
Programmed to kill themselves after the assassination, keeping the program invisible.
All right, so Minh's Vietcong...
Who we never officially identified as a POW.
Costavo:
Marielito.
Someone figured they could get him close to Castro.
See, the thing is, Brutus never worked.
30 years of experiments never produced a single viable candidate.
So the program was discontinued, the subjects cut loose.
Yeah, with pensions.
Well, I mean, that last gun's for somebody connected to all this.
Right!
I've compiled a list of subjects known to be in the Los Angeles area.
If Marcus has gotten the Brutus conditioning to work-- and it looks like he has-- every one of these men is a potential weapon.
What's this list?
Anyone who ever worked on Brutus.
Marcus didn't just pick his killers from the program, but his victims, too.
Marcus is sending the lab rats after the scientists.
712 subjects in one mind- control experiment in just Los Angeles?
No telling how many the Soviets worked on during the same time period.
Oh, that's a really good
Cold War way of thinking.
They're doing something bad, so let's do something worse and bigger.
Please.
Why didn't you tell us about this after the first shooting?
Why would you try and protect a failed program?
You want to see how Marcus got it to work.
Think about it.
You capture a terrorist, you condition him, you send him back to his cell-- bang.
"Condition" is a really polite word for "torture."
When you're fighting for a way of life, you use whatever weapon is available.
And before you know it, you've given up your way of life.
Charlie, what...?
We got people for this.
What are you doing?
What your people are doing, they're trying to match a rudimentary sketch against thousands of CIA personnel files.
What I'm doing here is trying to save you time and increase success potential considerably.
Now, by weighting the value of the search criteria to look for slight deviations-- say Finney chose eyebrow set #33-- what I'm doing is, I'm allowing the possibility of a near-miss.
Eyebrow set 32, set 34.
All right, cool.
Well, thanks.
Hey, um, are you guys planning any kind of party or anything for Larry?
He's not going anywhere.
Well, I don't know about that, Charlie.
He sure seems to be going someplace.
:
Don... can you seriously picture
Lawrence Fleinhardt in outer space?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean, more than anyone else I know.
Things change.
I mean, that's the way life is.
People get married;
they move on.
I'm aware of that, Don.
I do notice that nowhere on that list did you include "fly away in a rocket ship."
Charlie, I'm just saying, I know it can be tough.
The toughest part is...
The toughest part is sitting around while people fuel his delusion.
You see, 'cause that's not gonna help him any when reality ultimately sets in.
His delusion.
All right, if you say so.
Very impressive.
Mens sana in corpore sano.
So, what do you think?
Am I being too short-sighted in my acceptance of this mission?
Are you kidding?
I mean, setting aside the experiment itself, there's no telling what kinds of insight...
No, no, no, no.
Talking about my abdication of my life, my responsibilities, my burgeoning relationship.
You know, there's some parallels here to your own dilemma--
Harvard versus Cal Sci, Charles.
Well, the difference was,
Harvard wasn't offering me the better job.
What if they had?
It's only six months.
And Megan seems genuinely supportive.
Yeah, whereas your beau...
I don't know.
He seems to think that an 11th hour rethink will reveal my ambition to be... well, I believe the word "feckless" was used.
You know, he's never dreamt of something he couldn't reach.
So he has no idea what it's like to want something that you might not be able to get.
So how could he understand how much you'd give up if this chance comes along?
I know.
I know.
You ready?
What?
Let's go.
WHITTAKER:
Give me the bottle.
Got to take a leak anyway.
You guys are Parole, right?
Drug test?
FBI.
Questions.
About Carlos Costavo.
You and he bunked together in Chino?
Chino was three mistakes ago.
I'm way too old for a fourth.
Contact with discreditable persons gets me sent back for the rest of my nickel.
So does lying to the FBI.
His phone records have your number on them.
He calls me from time to time.
Mostly to complain.
About?
Excuse me.
Whichever boss...
Come on, come on, come on.
Whichever boss or girlfriend or stranger ticked him off this week.
Guy's always had a short fuse, you know.
Headaches.
Headaches?
Some kind of drug therapy or something in stir, got six years dinged off his bid.
Wasn't like he was right in the head in the first place, but...
You got any idea how we can get in touch with him?
Does it help me or hurt me if I do?
He spends a lot of time at MacArthur park.
Watches the old men play chess.
Thanks.
Chess tables are right up here.
And you know that because...
'Cause I spent 13 months in a tent.
It's either chess or skin rags.
Hey, check it out.
FBI!
Move!
Back!
He ran into the garage!
Carlos!
Get down!
?
?
Hey!
Carlos!
Carlos!
Carlos.
Who are you?
A guy who doesn't want to see you get hurt, all right?
Well, you're 20 years too late.
I've tried to do this before, you know.
Never quite took the last step.
Because you don't want to.
And then the one time, the one time I go through with it, the damned gun misfires.
But maybe... maybe this time, I finally make it.
Look at me, Carlos!
Look at me!
Look at me!
I don't want to do anything.
Just want to talk to you.
Okay?
Give me two minutes.
Go on and do whatever you got to, okay?
Just talk?
Just want to talk.
You lied to me!
David, apologize to the man for saving his life.
The things that sick bastard did...
You volunteered.
Yeah, well, after the first electroshock treatment,
I tried to un-volunteer.
Davis said they'd put the six years back on and another 25 for violating a federal agreement.
That was a quarter of a century ago.
Why'd you go after him now?
That's when the government guy came around.
Marcus.
Marcus said he was working for the government?
Said he was a doctor.
Some kind of posttraumatic follow-up program.
Kind of late for that.
He gave me some drugs, but they didn't work.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.
COSTAVO:
He said I was clinically depressed, that they would help.
I mean, the more we talked, the madder I got!
And that was...
Sit down.
He let slip where Davis worked.
And I started following him.
Gustavo, where'd you get the gun from?
Gun?
Yeah.
I-I don't know.
I don't remember.
One day, it was just there, on my bed.
Look, you know, I'm really tired.
These headaches, they make it so hard to sleep.
I mean, it boggles the mind.
I mean, they give speed to a guy who's mentally disturbed, hand him a gun, and then point him toward the people who tortured him.
Yeah, it's not exactly brainwashing, but it's not exactly different.
What do you think?
Revenge or blackmail?
Trying to show us what he can do?
He's got to have some kind of psychological background.
He knew exactly which subjects to pick.
He knew exactly which buttons to push.
CIA says there was no program that even remotely resembles the one he was talking about.
I'm gonna go back to the original people that worked on the program.
Maybe Marcus is on the list of victims somewhere.
Hold on a second.
You all right?
About Larry?
You know, it's hard to feel badly when you feel so proud.
But, yeah, the timing sucks.
Why do you ask?
I don't know.
Charlie seems to be struggling...
I just thought...
I'm just trying to take care of my own, that's all.
:
Oh, well, that would explain that throbbing vein in the middle of your forehead.
Thank you.
Well, I'm here if you need me.
Costavo's description isn't exactly the same as Finney's, is it?
It's a big break for us because more data is always better data.
So by weighting the commonalities between the sketches...
Oh, like if the same chin comes up twice, then it's probably the right chin.
I've actually tried to make this algorithm even more sophisticated.
So were looking for values that fall in a common range, not just perfect matches.
Since we've already inventoried the facial points of all of the potential suspects, we should whittle our way down to a few candidates relatively.
Didn't see that coming.
Uh, are you sure this is every person with access to the Brutus files?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Feels to me like were missing something so obvious we must've forgotten about it.
You know, can't see the forest for the...
Trees.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No.
So when Charlie's filter returned zero matches, we realized...
"We"?
Yeah, "we."
We realized that what we have is a classic example of Euclid's Orchard.
You see, because each perspective ofanorchardisunique, notonlygivingusinformation about the trees butabouttheposition of the observer.
We started from Minh and Costavo and worked our way backward.
Figuring out where all the information about their participation in the Brutus program existed, and who might have been privy to it.
The common denominator was the Freedom of Information Act.
Guys, Brutus was top secret.
You're right, but portions of it were declassified, in the 1970s with MK-ULTRA.
And then again in the '90s, they made more of it public with the class action suit against Chino.
There were a few dozen people who had access to these files.
One of them in particular...
Lawrence Dryden.
He's a practicing psychiatrist in Santa Monica.
Now he happens to have a brother named Porter, who actually served time in Chino in'89.
This guy Porter was definitely a patient of Davis's?
Brother Lawrence certainly seemed to think so.
He filed suit against the US in 2000, but the case was dismissed in '03.
Where are the Dryden brother now?
Porter OD'd and died four years ago.
Lawrence still lives on the west side.
Most significantly, my facial recognition algorithm shows us that Lawrence Dryden is an 87% match to our sketches of Marcus.
Dryden, step out.
We got a search and arrest warrant for you.
Let's go, guys.
Turn around.
Of course, of course.
Go ahead and look.
The guns aren't here.
You want to save us some time and tell us where they are?
Where they'll do the most good.
You haven't changed anything;
after this next killing, the truth will have to come out.
?
You think I'm a killer?
I'm not.
I'm a hero.
And how is that?
Because I'm willing to make hard decisions and suffer the consequences for a greater good.
My brother was no saint, but what they did to him should never happen, not here, not in this country.
Your brother OD'd 14 years after Brutus was over.
Porter never used heroin, not until after Chino.
It was the pain from those experiments that drove him to the drugs.
I went through the courts, I went through the press.
Everyone either didn't believe it or didn't care.
After all, these men are just prisoners.
So I knew if I wanted to stop Brutus, that I'd have to take stronger measures.
It's has been over for years.
They're planning to do it again.
Who?
Tallman was lobbying for relaxing California's restrictions on prisoner experiments, and that sadist Davis, offering his so-called expert testimony.
I just turned their own monsters against them.
And why's that?
You couldn't pull the trigger yourself?
No, these men have already been destroyed by Brutus.
In death, think of how many other lives they can save.
That sounds to me exactly what the CIA probably said when they started the whole thing to begin with.
So you tell me, what's the difference between them and you?
Hey.
Hey.
I'm not going to apologize for expressing my opinion.
Well, I'm not going to apologize for choosing to ignore it.
You got an interesting problem there.
Yeah, yeah.
It's based on a subject, Lawrence Dryden's, access to Freedom of Information files.
See, he had his pick of any of two dozen potential assassins, and I'm just trying to narrow down those candidates down by accessibility, by health, predisposition.
I just don't think I can be narrow enough, quickly enough.
Have you considered incorporating target selection theory?
You mean Von Neumann and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Well, actually, before then,
Von Neumann's acolytes had been doing work, more applicable I think, in the arena of conventional bombing.
Thetheorybeing that if you kept bombing high-valuetargets,overtime, the enemy would concentrate theirdefensesthere.
Butifyoubombed low-value targets, yeah,you'dsiphonoff some of their defenses, butovertime,you would sacrificing manpower, gasoline, deplete your bomb supplies.
So you're suggesting, and as always, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, that I analyze not only potential killers, but potential victims as well.
The list of people publicly endorsing increased prisoner experimentation.
So refining my previous analysis of Dryden's motivations and assessment of his likelihood for success...
Well, Larry, you are gone.
Don.
Ijustfinishedmytarget select theory analysis.
Themostprobablenextvictim isanarmycolonel who served at Leavenworth.
Hesupervisedexperiments on military prisoners fortheBrutusProject.
Great, Charlie.
Megan's got the colonel, andI 'monmy way to clear his house now.
Whataboutthekiller?
He's a man named Gates.
Hewasoneoftheprisoners at Leavenworth.
Got it, Charlie.
I'vegotDavidand Colbyon their way to pick up Gates.
He's not here.
Drop it now!
Drop it!
Guys, guys, we're clear.
Now that we have Marcus and all three guns,
I guess this case is closed.
What are you talking about?
We don't even know who else Dryden got to.
Case closed?
Okay, maybe I misspoke.
We're not going to allow you to open up any more lines of investigation.
Say what?
This is a national security issue.
You're going to cover this up, aren't you?
This was never about the past;
this is about the future.
So Dryden was right?
Tallman was pushing prison testing legislation?
This is just a back door to restart Brutus?
You've got to be kidding me.
What are you going to do with him, stick him in Guantanamo so he can't talking to anyone?
Your assistance has been appreciated, but this doesn't have to do with you anymore.
I shot a man tonight.
And your country thanks you.
I'd stay down unless you want to get hit again.
The night of the 18th,
I will be right there, between Cancer and Leo Minor, visible for roughly 14 seconds.
Hmm.
Then I'll have to get a telescope.
I guess I could pull strings, get you access to Cal Sci's Celestron.
Maybe I'd like to watch you from my own bedroom, by myself.
Listen... you know, I realize our relationship hasn't been exactly...
forward-leaning.
I do want you to know my heart will remain yours in my absence.
While you're in a space capsule with three guys?
I should hope so.
You know what I mean.
I do know what you mean.
But maybe for tonight, we should just... lean forward a little.
Charlie?
He's really going to do it, isn't he?
He's going to go.
He's going to go.
and I believe that there is no higher calling than that of public service.
And where others see the State Senate as a steppingstone to higher office, let me assure you,
I can see no greater service to the people I love.
OPERATOR:
911.
What's your emergency?
There's a man with a gun at the Quincy Hotel.
...making California safe to threats from without and within.
Hey, Bill.
Don.
Thanks for coming, guys.
Chippies are stretched thin today.
We could use more eyes out there.
So what's the deal?
Why's the Senator still here with a death threat?
He wouldn't let us pull him out.
COLBY:
So we have absolutely no control over who's already been let in.
Let's get the uplink to my people.
Why don't you guys hit the floor.
?
SENATOR:
...by a series of reforms designed to overturn 30 years of misguided optimism about the heart of a criminal and what resides there.
Thank you.
God bless you all and God bless the great state of California.
All right, guys, here comes the uplink.
Now.
I'm up.
Yeah, so are we.
I've been waiting for an opportunity to give my crowd dynamics program a shakedown.
Look, if this works, the security applications alone are staggering
It's amazing.
We're getting a real-time analysis of movement patterns, ongoing flow rate projections.
We're looking for a male, one male, probably with a handgun.
Lot of people in the area.
Hope you guys can narrow it down.
I'm fishing for body language and microexpressions, but with this many people, it's really just fishing.
Charlie?
Look, the software we're using is designed to determine corridor flow, maximize efficiency of ingress and egress.
You know, but what's really interesting here are the continuum approximations.
By analyzing the crowd as if it were a liquid-like substance...
We're looking for anomalies, like someone breaking the pattern of the reception line.
...fast and close for a shot at the senator.
Do you see that?
All right, we'd better double-check it against high-density, bidirectional flow results.
MEGAN:
Charlie, there's a time for double-checking and a time to make an educated guess.
Okay, then, we have an unaccountable congestion near a center table.
I have a male Asian, 60s, near the center table.
The body language is right.
He has slumped shoulders and a slack expression.
He's holding his jacket with his right hand.
?
Two o'clock, two o'clock.
I got him.
FBI!
Get down!
Move!
?
?
Put it down!
Put it down!
Right now!
Don't do that!
Don't do it!
Capture:
FRM@FadeOut Sync:
FRM@L.P.Prince
Vanh Minh, former Vietnamese citizen.
Joined the Vietcong at age 15, eventually became a recon platoon leader in Dinh Tuong.
Senator Tallman was in the Army, right?
In the '60s?
Never went to Vietnam.
Never even went overseas.
As far as we can tell, these two men never even met each other.
All right, so this guy disappears in '68, resurfaces in '78... as a US citizen?
Wait, how's he pull that off?
He's not a registered voter.
He has no political affiliation whatsoever.
I mean, it looks like a... classic lone gunman.
Yeah, but why kill a politician you don't even know?
Doesn't make any damn sense.
Landlord says that Minh paid his rent on time and kept to himself and fixed his own faucet.
Yep, and he kept a diary.
All in French, so I think we're gonna need a translator.
He planned this thing out in advance.
He bought the suit, the tie, and the shoes a week ago.
Even had time to get the pants taken in.
Well, careful prep is consistent with the murder-suicide.
"Brutus climbed into my mind and stopped me from functioning as a normal person."
Wow, she speaks French.
She dated a hockey player.
"Before Brutus, I was curious and intelligent."
You know, Brutus could be a code word for Tallman.
Yeah.
Did he happen to mention what he had against this guy?
He might not have had a specific grudge.
He's showing manifestations of schizophrenia.
Non-existent relationships, repressed rage.
And medication.
Nice grab.
:
Thanks.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.
That's speed.
Well, abuse would explain high levels of aggression.
Yep.
Answers a lot of questions.
Yeah, and begs a few more like who prescribed this and for what.
Yeah.
Also, why was he receiving pension checks from the Army?
The United States Army.
?
Oh, thanks again for use of your address, Charles.
Since the steam tunnels,
Professor Mildred has cut off all use of my faculty mailboxes.
And the... the magazine.
Charles.
Yeah.
I-I believe this is my copy of the Quarterly Review of Cosmology.
Yeah, it is.
Why are we engaged in combat over it?
Well, be-
- I'll tell-- because--
There's, there's something on the cover that may very well, um-- no, it is,it is going to upset you.
I was going to throw it out, and then I figured you'd find it sooner or later.
Just give it to me already.
"Igby's Law Redefines Gravity Flux Motivated by Sound Wave Propagation in Bose-Einstein Condensates."
Professor Johannes Igby?
Um, I know you publicly disputed Igby's approach.
The man is an anthropic imbecile.
You know, so what i-if, if he's been proven right?
He's had a law named after him.
So what if he's been put on the short list for the National Medal of Science Award?
He has?
It's on page 87.
So look, I mean, it, it may sting a little bit, you know, at first, but, um...
You're smiling.
I am?
Are you, are you in stunned shock?
It's okay.
I'll call the campus medic.
Actually, don't do that.
Tell you what you can do.
Take over my Computational Physics class.
Well, the last time I covered that class, one of your students...
Thank you so much, Charles.
911.
MAN:
There is a man with a gun at the Quincy Hotel.
Can I have your name?
He is going to kill Senator Martin Tallman.
It may already be too late.
No, I mean, he doesn't sound 60 and he doesn't sound Vietnamese.
No.
Voice recognition says male, Caucasian, 25 to 40.
And that call came in at 12:17 from a pay phone in the lobby.
By that time, Minh was already in the ballroom.
Autopsy results are in.
Death from a gunshot wound to Minh's head.
We need an autopsy to tell us that?
I was actually more interested in the pathology.
ME confirmed
Minh had been taking large doses of dextroamphetamine sulfate.
That prescription was written on a stolen pad.
Which suggests intentional abuse.
It's like he was getting himself angry enough to kill Tallman.
Did you get anywhere with the pension checks?
No, the VA had no records on him, so I pulled in a favor who's pulling in a favor.
And your favor's favor called me.
Agent Eppes.
Raymond, Central Intelligence.
We need to talk.
?
Let's take a little walk.
We'd be interested in doing an information share on the Tallman assassination.
Uh-huh.
Why are you guys so interested in a California State Senator?
Vanh Minh's citizenship and pension were functions of work he performed for us during Vietnam.
What, double agent?
I couldn't say.
Well, see, you know, as file-sharing goes, we're off to a bad start here.
I mean...
What I mean is I don't know.
Minh was part of a defunct program from a war we lost 30 years ago.
So what are you saying?
The guy was in the wind for 25 years?
And now he's front page news.
And I'd like to know what kind of damage control we're looking at.
No chest beating, just a request to keep a colleague in the loop.
All right, fair enough.
Thanks.
Minh's .38 was one of three purchased at a Nevada gun store last month.
Buyer used a stolen ID.
The store's name is Longan Ammo.
On the ATF's watch list.
Have a reputation for playing things a little fast and loose when it comes to background checks and waiting periods.
We got a straw purchase.
Yeah, then he sold it off to Minh.
What do we got?
A white male, 30s.
You really think we have some kind of conspiracy going on?
I don't know.
I think we'd better find those other two guns.
?
sends a buyer into a gun store.
Right, in this case, with a fake ID.
And the buyer purchases multiple guns legally...
Mm-hmm.
And then returns them to the dealer?
Yeah, it's called a straw purchase.
Gun stores can do that?
Just sell pistols to anyone with money?
They're not supposed to, but these people can find a way to make a buck.
I know what you're thinking.
An inductive application of the network effect.
Starting from Metcalfe's law?
No, you know how I feel about Metcalfe's law.
You know, it's value- based, so in my opinion, it just, it vastly overst...
BOTH:
Hi.
Can we come in?
This is perfect.
Where's Alan?
He's in Oakland until Monday.
Yeah, he's, he's over there consulting on a waterfront renovation project...
LARRY:
Um...
I think maybe we should wait.
No, we can't wait.
Wait for what?
Um, Larry has some really big news.
I'm leaving Cal Sci.
I'm leaving Los Angeles in fact, more specifically,
I will be leaving the planet Earth, though I will remain in orbit...
Okay.
If you don't tell them, I'm going to.
I will be on the next shuttle to the International Space Station leaving roughly three weeks from now.
You are not...
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, hold on.
What?
You must have suspected something.
I mean with my unorthodox living situations, my unexplained absences.
I thought that was you being...
You.
No.
And you knew about this?
Well, I knew he was taking more trips to Houston.
But no, I never pierced the "veil of mystery."
Yes, I guess my work in the cosmic microwave background had some relevance to the NSA's satellite signals technology and, uh, they contacted me last September.
Last September?
Yes.
Handshakes transpired, oaths were taken and the long and the short of it is that I was made alternate payload specialist.
He's going on the space shuttle for six months.
Wow.
Why didn't you ever say anything?
Because it was always just such a long shot, but with the recent good fortune of the original payload specialist, Johannes Igby,
Igby's Law.
his new responsibilities sadly prevent him from taking his seat on the shuttle.
So, so T-Minus?
Um, we're scheduled for departure on the 7th.
I will be leaving for Houston next week for final training and my flight physical.
Larry's got the right stuff.
All right, I'm getting some champagne.
Congratulations, Larry.
Oh, thank you.
?
So why Chicago?
Do not know.
Go ask my publisher.
I think you've got a girl there.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Girl in every port.
Mmm.
To a girl in every port.
Can I help you?
No, Stan!
Stan.?
Male, Hispanic, 40s.
The guy walks up to this table, puts five shots into the victim, turns the gun on himself, misfires, walks away.
Sounds a lot like the Tallman shooting.
LAPD detective made the same connection.
So they checked the serial number against our straw purchase.
Do we have a match?
Yeah, you think I'm going to call you out here, on your night off if we don't?
Victim is Stanford Davis.
This is his wife.
He's a psychiatrist.
Just wrote a book called New Methods of Operant Conditioning and Its Impact on Neuroanatomy.
I'll wait for the movie.
Yeah.
One gun purchase has given us two execution-style murders.
And one and a half suicides.
You used Metcalfe's Law after all.
You know, no one likes to hear "I told you so." Okay.
What are those?
It's a second gun from a shooting last night.
I'm tracing the past patterns of transactions across the network and it's-it's revealing some very predictable dynamics.
It's really something-- about Larry.
What, the whole, uh... space station thing?
Yeah, you seemed a little, uh...
A little what?
I don't know... upset?
Upset?
What do you mean?
No, I'm-I'm upset?
Of course not.
I'm not upset.
I mean maybe I would be if I thought he was actually going to go through with it.
Larry asked Dr. Finch for a leave of absence.
I mean he put his car in storage.
I have known Larry Fleinhardt for 15 years.
He's not going anywhere.
I think you should talk to him.
Why?
There's nothing to talk about.
Besides I've got to present my findings to Don, so...
Shooter left a pretty good print on the strap.
It comes back to...
Carlos Costavo.
He came to the US from Cuba with the 1980 Marielito exodus.
All right, so political refugee or a criminal?
No, he's definitely a criminal.
He got here, spent ten years at Chino for robbery and assault.
Costavo.
He hasn't been home in three days.
But we did find government pension checks and dextroamphetamine sulfate.
Same as Minh.
Yeah.
Something really strange is going on here.
?
Senator, psychiatrist, a Vietnamese POW, a Cuban refugee.
And the guns.
Right.
Well, looks like I'm right on time.
?
a list of gun sales from Longan Ammo, going back about two years and the suspected straw purchases are here in red.
And this is ATF's list of suspected street-level gun dealers and their sales patterns.
Now, what I did was I applied networking theory to a directed graph, using the source and known nodes to determine the sink.
Which is kind of like...
Kind of like... kind of like, oh, kind of like a telephone, which is actually the classic example of networking.
Okay, so we have stores and purchasers, dealers and buyers.
They're all part of the same network.
Right.
Now, what I did was study the call patterns, the straw purchases and I listened for the ringing telephone.
Now, I'm going to call a bullpen extension right now;
and how about you guys tell me which one I'm calling.
Oh, it could be about half a dozen phones right now.
So we've already narrowed down the possibilities considerably.
The more calls
I make... the easier it becomes to find the right one.
Hello.
Yeah, sorry, I'm just demonstrating networking theory.
She hung up.
So... the ringing phone we're looking for is the black market dealer, who bought the three guns.
I was actually looking for patterns of distribution, arrests that connect to straw sales according to time and proximity, not to mention the kind of weapons transacted.
Now by looking at the way that Longan Ammo made straw gun sales and then the appearance of the guns on the street...
You came up with a name.
Off of Senator
Tallman's shooting, I came up with four names, and given the second shooting,
I was able to narrow it down:
Sam Finney, a major gun dealer.
FBI.
You're under arrest.
FBI?
What'd I do to you guys?
You picked up the wrong phone.
?
RPGs... if you do time by the bullet, you got some problems here.
Yeah.
And you can make them all go away, right?
Nah,
I think that would take like a presidential pardon.
But I'll tell you something, Sam, you help me, maybe I get it down to five to ten.
I won't wear a wire.
Three Smith Wesson Model 64s, bought in Nevada last month.
Longan Ammo.
Guy runs the place like he's selling socks...
Get your hands back on the table.
Where'd they end up?
Some guy.
Guy.
All right, Sam.
Marcus.
All right, his name was Marcus.
Tried to move him up to Glocks, but he said he wanted to keep it simple.
Did he say what he wanted them for?
Yeah, they're a little expensive for paperweights, you know what I mean?
Yeah, that's funny.
I didn't ask.
That's it?
That's what you got for me?
Brown hair, blue eyes, 40, maybe 45.
Real quiet, talked like he was in a library.
All right, sit tight.
Keep your hands on the table.
Yeah, right.
Problem with these Identikit pictures, they're only as good as the description.
And Finney's wasn't great.
Hey, it's what we got, you know.
Okay, Stanford Davis was a prison psychologist at Chino from 1983 to 1985.
Wait, Costavo was there from 1981 to 1991, so, so they knew each other.
Yeah, and here's a little-known fact about the California Penal system:
they have a long and proud history of experimenting on prisoners.
And, uh, pharmaceutical companies test on inmates.
Yeah, but that's voluntarily, and in pretty limited circumstances.
I'm talking about behavior modification programs, sensory deprivation, chemical treatment, psychosurgery, many of which are underwritten by the Department of Defense, where the CIA friend came.
Including one "Brutus Project,"
which Davis worked on.
The same Brutus as in Minh's journal?
And the same Davis as in the shrink who was our second victim.
Julius Caesar's assassin's full name was Marcus Brutus.
Finney said he sold guns to a guy named Marcus.
So, now we've connected
Costavo to Davis, possibly to Minh.
Guess which State Senator has been pushing legislation through a repeal to ban on prison testing?
Uh, Tallman.
A equals B equals
C equals D; it's like one of Charlie's equations.
Can't believe I just said that.
Spring cleaning?
No.
As per Dr. Finch's request, I have now thoroughly vacated my lair.
I do take some comfort however, in remanding my few prized possessions into the custody of my closest friend.
Aw, well, thanks.
What do we got in here?
Oh, wow, the Newton Lacy Award.
My goodness.
Uh...
Of course, uh, some jazz recordings.
Of course.
An old... yeah, an old T-shirt.
Old T-shirt, worn on the day I first posited causal solutions to ultrahyperbolic wave equations and more memorably, when I vanquished Professor Musgrave at the Cal Sci's Texas Hold 'Em tournament.
Wow, then this is one lucky shirt.
Yeah, well, not to dwell on the negatives.
I am mindful of the risk involved in sitting atop two million liters of combusted liquid hydrogen and oxygen.
Larry.
Do you remember... when I was in my junior year and, uh, I decided to grow my moustache out?
The word "moustache" would be a charitable characterization.
You said that my follicle count failed to achieve critical mass.
That's... dear... sorry.
No, you were being brutally honest with me, you know.
And sometimes friends have to be brutally honest with each other.
Larry... you know this thing isn't really going to happen.
Because?
People die in space shuttles, Larry.
You know and at some point you're going to make a rational assessment of this situation.
You're going to realize that shooting yourself out of a cannon would just be feckless waste.
Let me get this right.
You are actually comparing my brushing the heavens with your barely postpubescent moustache.
No, I'm just being realistic.
It's a very fortunate thing for you that I am on the verge of fulfilling one of life's dreams.
Fortunate for me?
That's correct.
Because were I in a less ebullient frame of mind,
I might well just bop you in the nose.
Excuse me.
Have you ever heard of MK-ULTRA?
What, that's a CIA program in the, what, '50s.
LSD, mind control...
Right, right, LSD was part of it.
But they tried sensory deprivation, radiation, ELF.
Uh-huh.
What's that?
Extreme Low Frequency.
Certain pulses can actually affect a subject's emotional state.
MK-ULTRA was one of many programs.
Right, like Brutus?
The idea was to program enemy agents with posthypnotic suggestions, then send them home as sleeper assassins.
Assassins.
Programmed to kill themselves after the assassination, keeping the program invisible.
All right, so Minh's Vietcong...
Who we never officially identified as a POW.
Costavo:
Marielito.
Someone figured they could get him close to Castro.
See, the thing is, Brutus never worked.
30 years of experiments never produced a single viable candidate.
So the program was discontinued, the subjects cut loose.
Yeah, with pensions.
Well, I mean, that last gun's for somebody connected to all this.
Right!
I've compiled a list of subjects known to be in the Los Angeles area.
If Marcus has gotten the Brutus conditioning to work-- and it looks like he has-- every one of these men is a potential weapon.
What's this list?
Anyone who ever worked on Brutus.
Marcus didn't just pick his killers from the program, but his victims, too.
Marcus is sending the lab rats after the scientists.
712 subjects in one mind- control experiment in just Los Angeles?
No telling how many the Soviets worked on during the same time period.
Oh, that's a really good
Cold War way of thinking.
They're doing something bad, so let's do something worse and bigger.
Please.
Why didn't you tell us about this after the first shooting?
Why would you try and protect a failed program?
You want to see how Marcus got it to work.
Think about it.
You capture a terrorist, you condition him, you send him back to his cell-- bang.
"Condition" is a really polite word for "torture."
When you're fighting for a way of life, you use whatever weapon is available.
And before you know it, you've given up your way of life.
Charlie, what...?
We got people for this.
What are you doing?
What your people are doing, they're trying to match a rudimentary sketch against thousands of CIA personnel files.
What I'm doing here is trying to save you time and increase success potential considerably.
Now, by weighting the value of the search criteria to look for slight deviations-- say Finney chose eyebrow set #33-- what I'm doing is, I'm allowing the possibility of a near-miss.
Eyebrow set 32, set 34.
All right, cool.
Well, thanks.
Hey, um, are you guys planning any kind of party or anything for Larry?
He's not going anywhere.
Well, I don't know about that, Charlie.
He sure seems to be going someplace.
:
Don... can you seriously picture
Lawrence Fleinhardt in outer space?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean, more than anyone else I know.
Things change.
I mean, that's the way life is.
People get married;
they move on.
I'm aware of that, Don.
I do notice that nowhere on that list did you include "fly away in a rocket ship."
Charlie, I'm just saying, I know it can be tough.
The toughest part is...
The toughest part is sitting around while people fuel his delusion.
You see, 'cause that's not gonna help him any when reality ultimately sets in.
His delusion.
All right, if you say so.
Very impressive.
Mens sana in corpore sano.
So, what do you think?
Am I being too short-sighted in my acceptance of this mission?
Are you kidding?
I mean, setting aside the experiment itself, there's no telling what kinds of insight...
No, no, no, no.
Talking about my abdication of my life, my responsibilities, my burgeoning relationship.
You know, there's some parallels here to your own dilemma--
Harvard versus Cal Sci, Charles.
Well, the difference was,
Harvard wasn't offering me the better job.
What if they had?
It's only six months.
And Megan seems genuinely supportive.
Yeah, whereas your beau...
I don't know.
He seems to think that an 11th hour rethink will reveal my ambition to be... well, I believe the word "feckless" was used.
You know, he's never dreamt of something he couldn't reach.
So he has no idea what it's like to want something that you might not be able to get.
So how could he understand how much you'd give up if this chance comes along?
I know.
I know.
You ready?
What?
Let's go.
WHITTAKER:
Give me the bottle.
Got to take a leak anyway.
You guys are Parole, right?
Drug test?
FBI.
Questions.
About Carlos Costavo.
You and he bunked together in Chino?
Chino was three mistakes ago.
I'm way too old for a fourth.
Contact with discreditable persons gets me sent back for the rest of my nickel.
So does lying to the FBI.
His phone records have your number on them.
He calls me from time to time.
Mostly to complain.
About?
Excuse me.
Whichever boss...
Come on, come on, come on.
Whichever boss or girlfriend or stranger ticked him off this week.
Guy's always had a short fuse, you know.
Headaches.
Headaches?
Some kind of drug therapy or something in stir, got six years dinged off his bid.
Wasn't like he was right in the head in the first place, but...
You got any idea how we can get in touch with him?
Does it help me or hurt me if I do?
He spends a lot of time at MacArthur park.
Watches the old men play chess.
Thanks.
Chess tables are right up here.
And you know that because...
'Cause I spent 13 months in a tent.
It's either chess or skin rags.
Hey, check it out.
FBI!
Move!
Back!
He ran into the garage!
Carlos!
Get down!
?
?
Hey!
Carlos!
Carlos!
Carlos.
Who are you?
A guy who doesn't want to see you get hurt, all right?
Well, you're 20 years too late.
I've tried to do this before, you know.
Never quite took the last step.
Because you don't want to.
And then the one time, the one time I go through with it, the damned gun misfires.
But maybe... maybe this time, I finally make it.
Look at me, Carlos!
Look at me!
Look at me!
I don't want to do anything.
Just want to talk to you.
Okay?
Give me two minutes.
Go on and do whatever you got to, okay?
Just talk?
Just want to talk.
You lied to me!
David, apologize to the man for saving his life.
The things that sick bastard did...
You volunteered.
Yeah, well, after the first electroshock treatment,
I tried to un-volunteer.
Davis said they'd put the six years back on and another 25 for violating a federal agreement.
That was a quarter of a century ago.
Why'd you go after him now?
That's when the government guy came around.
Marcus.
Marcus said he was working for the government?
Said he was a doctor.
Some kind of posttraumatic follow-up program.
Kind of late for that.
He gave me some drugs, but they didn't work.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.
COSTAVO:
He said I was clinically depressed, that they would help.
I mean, the more we talked, the madder I got!
And that was...
Sit down.
He let slip where Davis worked.
And I started following him.
Gustavo, where'd you get the gun from?
Gun?
Yeah.
I-I don't know.
I don't remember.
One day, it was just there, on my bed.
Look, you know, I'm really tired.
These headaches, they make it so hard to sleep.
I mean, it boggles the mind.
I mean, they give speed to a guy who's mentally disturbed, hand him a gun, and then point him toward the people who tortured him.
Yeah, it's not exactly brainwashing, but it's not exactly different.
What do you think?
Revenge or blackmail?
Trying to show us what he can do?
He's got to have some kind of psychological background.
He knew exactly which subjects to pick.
He knew exactly which buttons to push.
CIA says there was no program that even remotely resembles the one he was talking about.
I'm gonna go back to the original people that worked on the program.
Maybe Marcus is on the list of victims somewhere.
Hold on a second.
You all right?
About Larry?
You know, it's hard to feel badly when you feel so proud.
But, yeah, the timing sucks.
Why do you ask?
I don't know.
Charlie seems to be struggling...
I just thought...
I'm just trying to take care of my own, that's all.
:
Oh, well, that would explain that throbbing vein in the middle of your forehead.
Thank you.
Well, I'm here if you need me.
Costavo's description isn't exactly the same as Finney's, is it?
It's a big break for us because more data is always better data.
So by weighting the commonalities between the sketches...
Oh, like if the same chin comes up twice, then it's probably the right chin.
I've actually tried to make this algorithm even more sophisticated.
So were looking for values that fall in a common range, not just perfect matches.
Since we've already inventoried the facial points of all of the potential suspects, we should whittle our way down to a few candidates relatively.
Didn't see that coming.
Uh, are you sure this is every person with access to the Brutus files?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Feels to me like were missing something so obvious we must've forgotten about it.
You know, can't see the forest for the...
Trees.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No.
So when Charlie's filter returned zero matches, we realized...
"We"?
Yeah, "we."
We realized that what we have is a classic example of Euclid's Orchard.
You see, because each perspective of an orchard is unique, not only giving us information about the trees but about the position of the observer.
We started from Minh and Costavo and worked our way backward.
Figuring out where all the information about their participation in the Brutus program existed, and who might have been privy to it.
The common denominator was the Freedom of Information Act.
Guys, Brutus was top secret.
You're right, but portions of it were declassified, in the 1970s with MK-ULTRA.
And then again in the '90s, they made more of it public with the class action suit against Chino.
There were a few dozen people who had access to these files.
One of them in particular...
Lawrence Dryden.
He's a practicing psychiatrist in Santa Monica.
Now he happens to have a brother named Porter, who actually served time in Chino in'89.
This guy Porter was definitely a patient of Davis's?
Brother Lawrence certainly seemed to think so.
He filed suit against the US in 2000, but the case was dismissed in '03.
Where are the Dryden brother now?
Porter OD'd and died four years ago.
Lawrence still lives on the west side.
Most significantly, my facial recognition algorithm shows us that Lawrence Dryden is an 87% match to our sketches of Marcus.
Dryden, step out.
We got a search and arrest warrant for you.
Let's go, guys.
Turn around.
Of course, of course.
Go ahead and look.
The guns aren't here.
You want to save us some time and tell us where they are?
Where they'll do the most good.
You haven't changed anything;
after this next killing, the truth will have to come out.
?
You think I'm a killer?
I'm not.
I'm a hero.
And how is that?
Because I'm willing to make hard decisions and suffer the consequences for a greater good.
My brother was no saint, but what they did to him should never happen, not here, not in this country.
Your brother OD'd 14 years after Brutus was over.
Porter never used heroin, not until after Chino.
It was the pain from those experiments that drove him to the drugs.
I went through the courts, I went through the press.
Everyone either didn't believe it or didn't care.
After all, these men are just prisoners.
So I knew if I wanted to stop Brutus, that I'd have to take stronger measures.
It's has been over for years.
They're planning to do it again.
Who?
Tallman was lobbying for relaxing California's restrictions on prisoner experiments, and that sadist Davis, offering his so-called expert testimony.
I just turned their own monsters against them.
And why's that?
You couldn't pull the trigger yourself?
No, these men have already been destroyed by Brutus.
In death, think of how many other lives they can save.
That sounds to me exactly what the CIA probably said when they started the whole thing to begin with.
So you tell me, what's the difference between them and you?
Hey.
Hey.
I'm not going to apologize for expressing my opinion.
Well, I'm not going to apologize for choosing to ignore it.
You got an interesting problem there.
Yeah, yeah.
It's based on a subject, Lawrence Dryden's, access to Freedom of Information files.
See, he had his pick of any of two dozen potential assassins, and I'm just trying to narrow down those candidates down by accessibility, by health, predisposition.
I just don't think I can be narrow enough, quickly enough.
Have you considered incorporating target selection theory?
You mean Von Neumann and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Well, actually, before then,
Von Neumann's acolytes had been doing work, more applicable I think, in the arena of conventional bombing.
The theory being that if you kept bombing high-value targets,over time, the enemy would concentrate their defenses there.
But if you bombed low-value targets, yeah, you'd siphon off some of their defenses, but over time, you would sacrificing manpower, gasoline, deplete your bomb supplies.
So you're suggesting, and as always, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, that I analyze not only potential killers, but potential victims as well.
The list of people publicly endorsing increased prisoner experimentation.
So refining my previous analysis of Dryden's motivations and assessment of his likelihood for success...
Well, Larry, you are gone.
Don.
I just finished my target select theory analysis.
The most probable next victim is an army colonel who served at Leavenworth.
He supervised experiments on military prisoners for the Brutus Project.
Great, Charlie.
Megan's got the colonel, and I'm on my way to clear his house now.
What about the killer?
He's a man named Gates.
He was one of the prisoners at Leavenworth.
Got it, Charlie.
I've got David and Colby on their way to pick up Gates.
He's not here.
Drop it now!
Drop it!
Guys, guys, we're clear.
Now that we have Marcus and all three guns,
I guess this case is closed.
What are you talking about?
We don't even know who else Dryden got to.
Case closed?
Okay, maybe I misspoke.
We're not going to allow you to open up any more lines of investigation.
Say what?
This is a national security issue.
You're going to cover this up, aren't you?
This was never about the past;
this is about the future.
So Dryden was right?
Tallman was pushing prison testing legislation?
This is just a back door to restart Brutus?
You've got to be kidding me.
What are you going to do with him, stick him in Guantanamo so he can't talking to anyone?
Your assistance has been appreciated, but this doesn't have to do with you anymore.
I shot a man tonight.
And your country thanks you.
I'd stay down unless you want to get hit again.
The night of the 18th,
I will be right there, between Cancer and Leo Minor, visible for roughly 14 seconds.
Hmm.
Then I'll have to get a telescope.
I guess I could pull strings, get you access to Cal Sci's Celestron.
Maybe I'd like to watch you from my own bedroom, by myself.
Listen... you know, I realize our relationship hasn't been exactly...
forward-leaning.
I do want you to know my heart will remain yours in my absence.
While you're in a space capsule with three guys?
I should hope so.
You know what I mean.
I do know what you mean.
But maybe for tonight, we should just... lean forward a little.
Charlie?
He's really going to do it, isn't he?
He's going to go.
He's going to go.
MAN:
Get on the ground, all of you!
Do not move!
THIEF 1:
Let's go, let's go.
Throw it.
THIEF 2:
Let's get out of here.
[BANGING]
THIEF 1:
Turn around.
THIEF 2:
Wrong way.
THIEF 1:
Yo, leave this way.
Go, man.
- Come on, hurry.
THIEF 2:
Watch out.
THIEF 1:
Follow me, follow me.
THIEF 2:
Over there.
MAN:
Drop the bags!
Get down on the floor, now!
Hands above your heads!
[GROANS]
THIEF 1:
Man, you ain't cops.
MAN:
No, we're not cops.
What the hell are you doing?
MAN:
Protecting the innocent, punishing the guilty.
DAVID:
Whoa.
This I have not seen before.
What do you say, Nikki?
Your boys at L.A.P.D. Couldn't handle a B and E?
B and E's they can handle just fine.
But they do need help
- tracking down a group of vigilantes.
DAVID:
Vigilantes?
- Might explain the message.
- Yeah.
Fifth incident in two months.
Similar situation, same types of victims.
What, these mooks are victims?
Yeah, got five subjects, ages 16 to 19.
Now, white, Latino, black.
No gang affiliations.
They were found with lock picks, crowbars, cable cutters and backpacks full of school computer equipment.
Wrapped up like Christmas presents for the police.
The vigilantes ambushed them.
High-powered lights, improvised flash-bangs, plastic restraints.
What about Vanguard?
That come up on the databases?
- Eh, nada.
- So you don't have anything?
No, I just got this cell phone.
- Found it here on the floor.
- Dropped by a vigilante, robbers?
Yeah, or a student.
I mean, it could be anybody.
Well, if they can't tell us anything, this might.
Someone scraped out the MIN
- and the ESN.
- Translation.
The MIN's a phone number, ESN's the electronic serial number.
So this wasn't dropped on the floor by a student.
Getting rid of the phone number is easy.
Getting rid of the ESN, it's supposed to be impossible.
You guys know math?
Well, you can add, right?
Well, add up the cost of the equipment you were trying to steal and that's grand larceny.
- It's a first offence.
We won't do time.
DAVID:
Oh, yeah?
Ha, ha.
Who told you that?
[DAVID CHUCKLES]
You know, I'm looking at you the two of you, and I just don't see masterminds.
But you knew where all the computers were and you knew how to get past an alarm system.
So I'm thinking you had some help.
Keep your mouth shut.
Maybe you and I should have a talk alone.
You know what will happen.
I don't know nothing.
That's the third round with these guys.
I never figured the FBI couldn't get a bunch of kids to talk.
They're scared to death of someone.
You know, the lobby's filling up with parents and lawyers.
We're running out of time.
A cold boot attack?
Yeah, also known as a cold ghosting attack, an iceman attack.
When I remove the memory chip all the data in it will be lost instantly.
But, if I freeze it first, the data remains readable.
For sometimes, as long as several minutes.
[KEYBOARD CLICKING]
- You got it.
- Wow, that actually worked?
- Of course.
- Match that to the cell carrier's ESN.
Then get the name and the address, then we go get him.
CLERK:
Thank you.
Take care.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
- Put it down.
Put it down now.
- What the hell is going on?
- Are you Bai Lan Zhou?
- What?
No.
- Bai Lan, where is he?
- He?
You don't know
- what you're talking about.
- We know Bai Lan owns this phone.
And it's registered to this address.
Hey, Grandma?
FBI has your phone.
No, I got it.
- Bai Lan Zhou?
CLERK:
And that's her phone.
It never leaves her sight.
Texting charges are through the roof.
Someone must have cloned her number.
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Inconvenience?
Yeah, you can file a complaint, sir.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING OVER RADIO]
So the truck's stolen and there was a crew unloading electronics off of it.
And the driver said it was a bunch of kids.
That's one of these vigilante kids.
Two shotgun slugs to the chest.
Someone decided to fight back.
Check this out.
Looks like we got ourselves a feud.
DAVID:
Facial recognition software identified the dead guy as Peter Hathaway, 22, grad student at Mission Hills College.
Thesis candidate in systems engineering.
Talked to the parents, said they never heard of Vanguard or vigilante activity.
Need to find these guys before they get killed.
All right, friends, students, teachers.
And who is running the crew?
- Where are they based?
- And how did this war start?
- Hey, can I show you something?
- Yeah.
- The kids we arrested at the school?
- Uh-huh.
They all live in the same general neighbourhood, Atwater Village.
Just over the 5 freeway, a.k.a. Toonerville.
A.k.a. What?
That's a L.A.P.D. Nickname because of this guy, Vic Tooner.
Suspected in dozens of crimes, including murder.
L.A.P.D. Hasn't been able to get anything on him.
Witnesses, informants, all turn up dead.
This guy's got an entire neighbourhood terrified.
He runs his crew military style.
You know, organised.
Posts sentries to watch out for cops 24/7.
He's smart, but he's also crazy.
He murdered one of his lieutenants for driving the same car he drives.
- He's got the kids working for him.
- Yeah.
He uses kids because if they get caught, they'll be back on the street.
Just like old Fagin.
Yeah, it explains the murdered vigilante.
Uh, Tooner wouldn't tolerate anyone messing with his operation.
Cell phones can be cloned using a DDI.
A digital data interpreter.
Yeah, cellular thieves sit by busy roads and pick up radio-wave transmissions.
So serial numbers and phone numbers of people passing by are captured and recorded.
Great, now you tell me.
Can they monitor me if all I'm doing is playing Tetris?
Can we trace these DDI devices?
Unfortunately, they don't emit enough of a signal.
- All right, so this is a dead end.
CHARLIE:
Maybe not.
Can I see this?
Yeah, you know, Vanguard has advanced engineering skills.
So maybe they're getting access to the robbery crew's communications.
And if we figure out how, maybe it'll give the FBI a lead on where the next robbery will happen.
- How would you go about doing that?
- Whew.
That's a difficult problem.
Three words:
Deep-current sets.
And the expert on them is guest lecturer at CalSci at the moment.
- Um, Marshall Penfield?
- He's your friend, right?
- Friend...
- Oh, more like a frienemy.
That's that guy you were always having those math fights with.
The one who calls Charles "Eppsy."
Well, I mean, he did help out with that home invasion case
- a couple years ago.
- Tangentially.
Charlie, we gotta get this figured out before anybody else gets killed, okay?
I know, I know.
Uh, Professor Fleinhardt, a word?
You know, actually I'm expecting to hear from a colleague at CERN, and you know how wounded particle physicists get when their calls go to voice mail.
So anyway, ciao.
Robert Santos?
I wanna talk to you about your roommate, Peter Hathaway.
Like I told the police, I didn't know him very well.
Even though you shared a room with him for nearly a year?
We didn't hang out.
Yeah, what do you know about him?
He was lonely, you could see it.
Sometimes he tried to talk about classes, something he was reading, but, you know, I'm so busy
- with classes and tutoring.
- His behaviour change recently?
He used to be in every night, but starting three months ago, he went out a lot.
Did he indicate where?
And maybe mention a group called Vanguard?
No, never said a word.
And I never asked where he was going, so...
What, what is it?
I don't know, maybe if I'd tried to talk to him a little, invited him to hang out with me and my friends he wouldn't have gotten mixed up in whatever he was doing.
When he died, uh...
Look, I gotta go.
Peter's parents are coming today.
And I have no idea what I'm gonna tell them.
From set theory's inception some have argued that it's a game that includes elements of fantasy.
Wittgenstein questioned how Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory handled infinities.
Errett Bishop dismissed it as:
"God's mathematics, which should be left for God to do."
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Next week's discussion will be on the Spectral Theory of non-Hermitian Random Matrices.
Okay?
You're welcome.
I'll see you next week, you math geniuses.
- Where's the glasses?
- Where's the hair?
You know, these CalSci students really can appreciate an incisive discussion from a guest lecturer.
- How can they resist your charms?
- Yes, it is impossible, isn't it?
Speaking of which, how is Amita?
- Are you two still dating?
- Yeah.
Really?
Well, good for you, Eppsy.
- Marshall.
- Yes?
- I'm gonna ask you something.
- Okay.
And if it's at all possible that you can manage not to launch into your smirky world of glee
- it'd be much appreciated.
- Who, moi?
I'm working on a case, you know, for the FBI, and, uh, it might benefit from your work in deep current set theory.
So Charlie Eppes is asking for my help, a second time.
What, too gleeful?
Sure, it'd be fun.
Yeah, I can't sleep either.
I got this ratio-of-green-space problem for CalSci landscaping.
I can't get out of my head.
- What is this, non-FBI math?
- Not for long.
"Professor Marshall Penfield." He's working on a case with you?
Hey, so, uh, this Saturday you wanna have Amita and Don and Robin over for brunch?
Better make it dinner.
I got golf and Don's going to temple.
Since when does Don go to temple?
I don't know.
A few weeks ago, I guess.
COLBY:
So L.A.P.D. Responded to an alarm at an auto-sound shop about five weeks ago, found three teenagers in restraints, like at the school.
Back then they didn't know they had an ongoing problem.
And so maybe something got overlooked.
Good thinking, Granger.
They did miss something.
What are you showing me, the gang signs?
Yeah, I spent a year on L.A.P.D. Gang Task Force.
Never seen nothing like that.
- That mean anything to you?
- Uh, not immediately.
But there might be a subset within the superset.
And for those of us who don't speak math?
I'm talking about set theory.
Let's say this circle represents objects visible in the night sky.
And this circle represents objects that generate light.
Where they overlap is a subset.
Objects visible in the night sky that generate light, like a star.
How do you not have your own show on PBS?
The big question in this case is, obviously, how do the vigilantes know where the robbery crews will strike?
That's where Marshall's deep current theory comes in.
It looks for undetected sets.
Think of patterns in crowds.
Crowds move in general patterns.
Relatively minor events in specific areas can change the overall patterns for everyone even if most never see what created the change.
This approach allows us to deduce information about the hidden nodes from the anomalies in the observed behaviour of the visible network.
Is that an accurate assessment, Marshall?
Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have dozed off during your riveting monologue.
- I was stating the problem.
- Yeah, your approach to the problem.
- Using your method.
- Being as though it's my method,
- shouldn't I be leading this inquiry?
- Well, this isn't a seminar, Marshall.
It's a criminal investigation.
So, uh...
So then you have, uh, handcuffs, yeah?
Oh, yeah, that will get you there.
- I like the sound of that.
- Well, don't.
Okay.
Where'd you find this?
At a business where the vigilantes, uh, caught some thieves.
It's computer code.
Why would anyone use a few random computer code symbols?
- Unless it isn't random.
- Yeah, what about that?
It would take pages of code to say anything meaningful.
Well, what if it's not a computer code, but a cipher code?
It could take months to figure out.
They painted it on a wall.
I doubt they made it hard to crack.
Yeah, well, maybe it's a simple Vigenère cipher.
Then match the first 13 letters of the alphabet to those 13 code symbols.
And what if the key word is Vanguard?
[BEEPING]
- Is that a website?
AMITA:
Let's find out.
[KEYBOARD CLICKING]
Vanguard's website.
Those are the robberies the vigilantes stopped.
They even have the exact times that each robbery was supposed to happen.
And look at the last one.
Appliance warehouse downtown, and the date, that's today.
[BEEPS]
CHARLIE:
Vic Tooner.
MARSHALL:
Who's that?
- That is trouble.
- Well, he doesn't look friendly.
A daytime robbery.
Tooner's looking to flush out Vanguard where he can see them.
- They're taking the stuff.
- Yeah, I'm watching.
It's just the robbers.
There's no sign of Tooner.
And Vanguard isn't showing either.
Ken, you got anything?
KEN [OVER RADIO]:
Negative, all zones are clear.
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]
COLBY:
Don, the crew's moving out.
We gotta move in.
All right, let's go.
All units move in, take them.
[TYRES SCREECH]
AGENT 1:
Down on the ground!
AGENT 2:
FBI.
AGENT 1:
Head down!
DON:
Get out of that truck!
Now!
- Turn around, turn around.
AGENT 1:
Get out!
- Okay, let's move it.
DON:
Hands behind your back.
NIKKI:
Now, now, now.
COP 1:
Put your hands on the wall.
COP 2:
Give me your left hand.
MAN [ON RADIO]:
We've got suspects in custody.
None of Tooner's kids looked armed for a showdown.
Let's check out these people here, check out all these people here.
Wanna look at the crowd?
See if anyone's wearing Vanguard symbol?
DON:
Yeah.
- That we found.
East perimeter found him on a rooftop with this, filming the robbery.
They kill one of yours, you show up with a camera?
My mission was to gather evidence, not to intervene.
What mission?
Who's part of this mission with you?
I was there to record the incident.
Nothing else.
That against the law?
Prior knowledge of a crime?
Yeah, that's a problem.
- Who you working with?
- We don't use names.
Just code names.
If we're captured, we can't compromise the operation.
DAVID:
Do you know him?
We call him Bars.
His code name.
Bars?
Yeah, you know, like on a cell phone.
He's a phreaker.
Uh, a phone expert, could do stuff with cell phones.
COLBY:
So how do you know which places to rob?
There's a website.
Or you get a phone call.
Or a guy comes to your house.
That's how you get the word.
Where to go, what to steal.
And who gives the word?
Nobody talks about that.
You're gonna take the full weight for stuff you didn't plan or control.
It's worth it to do what's right.
- And what's that?
- Doing what needs to be done.
What the cops haven't been able to do.
Do you know a guy named Vic Tooner?
Never heard of him.
Not ever.
[ELEVATOR BELL RINGS]
Tooner seems to have a deep supply of kids, all too scared to talk.
The guy from Vanguard was stonewalling us also, but he's not scared.
So, what's that about?
Um, maybe someone inspired him.
I mean, he speaks like a covert op on a mission.
- They both have the same methods.
- Yeah, only one is pure damn evil, and the other one's trying to play hero.
You're wrong, its structure lacks originality or integrity.
It's a classic organisation based on tested and proven elements.
It's a chain.
It's a chain with irregularities that come with maintaining complex matrices.
So you propose that a single-point mechanism provides superior output?
Enough.
Surely two eminent mathematicians can find ways to calmly discuss theory.
- We're not discussing theory.
- We're talking hamburgers.
Pie 'n' Burger's the best, no question about it.
In 'n' Out is far superior.
You know, I remember a day not long ago, when you were both undergrads working together on a topology problem.
That's only because you assigned us to work on it together.
CHARLIE:
We preferred working alone.
Which is my point.
Neither of you is gifted at the art of collaboration which is most crucial to science.
Who is this?
Is this one of our students?
No, it's a grad student at, uh, Harvey Mudd College.
FBI arrested him in connection with the vigilante group.
No one else in his circle seems connected to vigilante activities.
But this student is defined by the same deep current as the other vigilantes.
So we should look at supersets as they define this student.
- Like the fact he is a student.
LARRY:
Precisely.
There's a finite number of grad students in the region.
Even fewer with the computing and telecommunications skills required.
Yeah, they hide the organisations, so you need to refine the search by eliminating people openly linked to identified Vanguard members.
So we work up an algorithm that does that and...
And just set it loose in grad school databases.
Ah, the sweet sound of collaboration.
This will ID students who fit the profile of Vanguard members.
The results will be based on probability, so you can't just arrest people whose names pop up.
You don't want us making life miserable for innocent grad students.
- That's what professors are for.
NIKKI:
You guys work with bright kids.
I mean, why do you think these Vanguard guys would risk their lives going up against a violent criminal?
A hazard of being smart.
You figure you can outthink anybody.
MARSHALL:
Look at life like a chess game.
You make smart moves, you win.
This isn't a game or a classroom problem.
MAN 1:
You want it back, man?
MAN 2:
Make a ball roll.
MAN 3:
Give it back.
MAN 4:
Make me, man.
MAN 5:
All right, let it go.
- Hey.
MAN 1:
Let's go, man.
Go in the house.
Everybody knows our name, but nobody's glad we came.
I've never seen a neighbourhood this scared.
Hey, these are for you.
Thanks, little guy.
Who sent them over?
Heard you guys are looking for me.
NIKKI:
Yeah, he used to pull this with L.A.P.D.
Walk up to officers on the street, come in for interviews.
He knows we don't have anything.
I own a tattoo parlour.
Legal, licensed business.
What do you know about robbery teams running out of your neighbourhood?
I hope the police can do something about that.
Somebody's trying to do something about that.
Well, I understand why people do that.
I'm a concerned citizen, like anybody else.
Oh, I know how difficult it is to police an urban area with a gang subculture in a black-market economy.
Oh, you'd have to spend years working to infiltrate highly secretive groups that are paramilitary in their operation.
So we've got ourselves a concerned citizen.
I studied police sciences.
I took classes at City College.
Hey, maybe I'll apply to the Academy.
You know, I bet you I could ace that obstacle course.
[LAUGHS]
What do you know about a group called Vanguard?
- Just what I hear on the street.
DON:
And what's that?
Smart guys in over their heads.
Over their heads?
How so?
Oh, you know, emotionally.
Living in a dream world.
What do you think is gonna happen to them?
What happens to anybody?
Some will quit.
Some will have accidents.
- Accidents?
- Accidents.
Car accidents, whatever.
Also, depression is a problem for college kids.
You, uh...
Well, you might find one of them way in the back of the library.
Note pinned to his chest, hanging from a rafter.
[CHUCKLES]
What does it matter?
One by one, sooner or later, everybody dies.
- Where you going?
- This is a non-custodial interrogation.
Oh, I can leave whenever I want.
CHARLIE:
You ruined it, look at it.
You flattened the tip and now it's out of ink.
How was I supposed to know that you like scented markers and that your favourite flavour is strawberry?
Well, listen, you know, the next time, do me a favour and just bring your own markers, okay?
Here's another thing.
Your idea about the analysis of Vanguard's attacks, it totally ignores the cardinality of the union of sets.
You know, what's funny?
It's my idea, so I think I know how it's supposed to work.
Oh, who is the expert on deep current sets here, huh?
Me.
Why does he always negate my proposals?
- Why are you so dismissive?
- Why are you so competitive?
Boys, don't make me pull the math car over.
This isn't about math, is it, Eppsy?
Maybe it's about you calling me Eppsy.
Anyway, ahem, I was thinking that if someone at Vanguard is that familiar with the computer source code
I should probably take a closer look at the browser code on the website.
Yes, programmers often use distinctive object-oriented symbols, uh, statements, method calls.
AMITA:
Exactly.
My comparative analysis shows the Vanguard code is very similar to a code found in the intra-university astrophysics project.
Note that success results not from the Eppes method nor from the Penfield approach, but from the Ramanujan scan.
All right, Amita, can you find the name of the person who wrote this code?
Because that might be the leader of Vanguard.
Why do I let Marshall get to me?
LARRY:
He's a rival.
Look, everybody has one and, frankly, who they are says a lot about who you are.
Yeah?
What does Marshall hating me say about me?
He doesn't hate you.
What is that word that Amita uses?
- Frienemy.
- There you go.
Colleagues as well as rivals.
I think you just remind each other of a time in your careers when you were both less secure in your reputations.
What about you?
Who sets you off?
Al McNabb.
Guy in my car club, he absolutely covets my Ford roadster.
And yet he always says the leather is not restored to 1931 period standard.
The colour is all wrong.
He is just one jealous bastard.
You know who doesn't have a rival?
Don.
Seriously, I've never heard him talk about anyone like that.
Well, Don questions and challenges himself.
He's like his own frienemy, so to speak.
You know, maybe that's why he's going to temple.
What is it that Rabbi Abraham Heschel said:
"The primary task of the philosophy of religion is to discover those questions to which religion is an answer."
Now, did my dad tell you that?
About Don going to temple?
No, Don did.
He told you?
He didn't tell me.
What's up?
Uh, nothing, it's just something Tooner said about, um, Vanguard members having accidents.
You know, suicide in a library.
Maybe we should call the local colleges.
All right.
[POLICE SIRENS WAILING]
So, what did Nikki say about Tooner?
Smart, but crazy.
Looks like the crazy part.
Mason Spellman, 19, physics major.
ME thinks he was dead about 10 hours before his body was found.
In the engineering library, pretty much like Tooner said.
In general terms.
Robin is gonna definitely say we need more than this.
Especially since Spellman had a problem with depression.
No other fingerprints at the crime scene except for his.
Note is in his own handwriting.
So we think we know how Tooner has been able to locate those vigilantes.
The deep current set analysis reveals that he's found some way to reverse engineer their technology.
Right, so we're gonna try to duplicate Tooner's math.
All right, that sounds good.
None of the dead kids have a connection to Tooner that we can find.
I'm thinking somebody at Vanguard must have crossed paths with him.
Right, see if you can find any of those colleges he took courses at, you know.
Tooner audited courses at Occidental and Whittier, as well as City College.
And while at City College,
L.A.P.D. Had him as a person of interest in the rape and murder of student Lori Sanchez.
OLIVER:
Never met her.
I heard she died.
And how did you hear that?
It was a topic of discussion.
With who?
I told you, I don't know names.
But a lot of people care when an innocent person dies.
You really think that this is all revenge for one murdered girl?
Let's find out more about her.
- Hey, what's up?
- I'm on my way to school.
Got to get through that analysis for you.
You and Marshall really set each other off, huh?
Yeah, I know, I don't know, we're, uh, frienemies.
- Where's Dad?
- He's around.
- Hey, Don.
- Hey.
So you started going to temple?
Dad tell you that?
And Larry.
Is there some reason you didn't tell me?
I don't know, you know, it's just like that thing you're always saying about not contaminating experiments.
Yeah.
Charlie, I don't know where I'm going with it, I just...
I can't get into a scientific debate with you about whether it's logical or not.
Since when did you listen to everything I say?
- Uh, you can be pretty intimidating.
- To you?
To everybody.
Well, I think going to temple is an interesting choice.
I have nothing negative to say about that.
- Okay.
- At least it's not a monastery.
Ah.
- All right, see you at dinner, all right?
- Yeah.
What, you standing there listening?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I heard every word, yeah.
Okay, so let's have it.
I think you did a good job all these years hiding any sign that he intimidates you.
[LAUGHS]
- Well, that's what I think.
- All right.
So the vigilante who wrote the coding, he was involved in this astrophysics project?
Yes.
Similar phrases, styles.
NIKKI:
Who do you think killed Lori Sanchez?
That Vic Tooner creep.
But the police said there was no evidence.
There was no mention in the file about a boyfriend.
She didn't have one.
Was there anybody special?
Some guy that maybe liked her?
There's this guy, didn't go to school here.
Okay, I have it down to one programmer.
So that's the person behind Vanguard's computer network.
He worked as a tutor, super smart, had a huge crush on Lori.
His name was Clayton.
Here's his personal website.
NIKKI:
We think this is the leader of the vigilantes.
Clayton Caswell.
Studying for his master's in computer engineering.
Tutored Lori Sanchez.
Been missing three days, so he's either hiding out or Tooner got to him, we just haven't found his body yet.
Oh, we'd have found him.
Tooner would make sure of that.
Run down every place he can be.
I'll see if I can get Charlie on it.
Takes a nerd to catch a nerd, huh?
COLBY:
All right, enough of the l-don't-know-names crap.
I know you know Clayton Caswell.
What does it matter now?
He's gonna die, that's why it matters.
And the rest of Vanguard with him because Tooner has figured out how to get to them.
- Clayton can handle it.
- He can't handle it.
He's gonna get a lot of people killed.
So where is he?
I don't know, okay?
I wasn't told where they'd hide if it came to this.
This is all about a girl who died.
I get why Clayton wants revenge against Tooner for Lori Sanchez.
- But what about the rest of you guys?
- Clayton's the type of guy...
When he wants you to do something, he makes you feel like you can make a difference.
Like you're part of something important and special.
So you guys wanna be heroes?
Yeah.
Don't you?
God, why am I so stupid?
You want answers one through 50 or 50 through a hundred?
The regional cell matrix.
That's the deep current.
Uh, Tooner mines the regional cell phone matrix for data on the movement of merchandise.
Vanguard mines Tooner's cell matrix subset.
- You know, if we set up derivatives...
- What, for all regional cell calls?
You realise that will take days on a supercomputer.
- Like you have a better approach.
- Just narrow it down the data set.
It's quite logical.
- Why are we fighting about it?
- Well, I'm not fighting.
- What would you call this?
- I don't know, you started it.
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.
[COMPUTER BEEPS]
- What was that?
- Ongoing analysis of the robberies and past possible targets.
That's a computer repair store.
Vanguard's data said Tooner hit that.
There's no police report of a break-in, so that's an anomaly.
Maybe it wasn't reported.
We need this information for the data grid.
Maybe Vanguard left its graffiti symbol.
Wanna go on a field trip?
So where are the Wonder Twins?
Oh, they probably started arguing, forgot all about food.
Oh, man, I'm starving.
Looks open.
CHARLIE:
Hello?
MARSHALL:
Hello?
Hello, is anyone here?
Hi, we're looking for an owner, uh, maybe a manager.
Just whoever is in charge.
That would be me.
You here about a computer?
Yeah, we, uh, were expecting a call about when to come pick up our system.
It's a, um, compact supercomputer.
It's very valuable.
Supercomputer?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, eight serial CPUs, uh, vector processing...
It's got a liquid-cooled HVAC system.
It's our baby.
It can even calculate the path of subatomic particles.
Or play 300 versions of "Halo" at the same time.
Yeah, I think I remember that one.
My partner processed that work order.
I'd have to look for it.
[CELL PHONE RINGS]
Maybe that's him.
Hello?
TOONER:
Listen, we can find it if you don't know what you're looking for.
Uh, feel free to look around.
After all it's your supercomputer.
As they say:
Mi casa es su casa.
- All right.
- Ha, ha.
Guys, I gotta go.
- Gotta be here somewhere.
- Yeah, uh, well, uh, this isn't it.
CHARLIE:
Um, I think maybe...
DON:
Hey, Colby, Charlie's on my cell.
I need you to get a location, meet me there with L.A.P.D., got it?
COLBY [OVER RADIO]:
What's going on?
He might be with Tooner.
Uh, did you change the, uh, decorative shell?
No.
Guys, sorry I can't wait around for you to find your computer.
Yeah, no, that's fine.
We'II, uh, come back in the morning.
Thanks.
Don't you want to wait around for your brother, Professor Eppes?
Here's a math problem for you.
Take the number of people who have seen me at crime scenes.
Subtract the number who've testified.
DAVID:
He's gone.
CHARLIE:
He was here.
- In all of his sociopathic glory.
- L.A.P.D. Is running traffic checks.
I don't understand how you guys ended up here.
We thought it was an old crime scene, turned out to be a currently active one.
NIKKI:
You okay?
MARSHALL:
Yeah.
Adrenaline makes my skin itch.
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING OVER RADIO]
In a world where mathematicians go mano a mano with a killer...
This time it's personal.
We gotta get this guy.
All right, he made me itch in front of strangers.
He told me he was gonna kill me, you know, in so many words.
It's no wonder the Vanguard kids hate him, he's quite hateable.
Yeah, if he killed one of my friends, I'd go after him.
Clayton Caswell and Tooner, they hate each other.
They want a confrontation.
It sounds like they created a classic game-theory scenario, doesn't it?
Yes, it does, Johnny Von Neumann, the old three-man gunfight.
A mathematical gunfight, huh?
Imagine a duel between three people, okay?
Now, I'm the worst shot.
I hit the target once every three tries.
One of my opponents is better, hits it twice every three shots.
The third guy is a dead shot.
He never misses.
Come on.
Now, each gets one shot.
As the worst, I go first.
Then Charlie.
Then Colby.
Who do I aim for my one shot?
I guess me because I'm the biggest danger, right?
I shoot Eppsy first, but not for the obvious reasons.
Chances are, two to one, I'm gonna miss.
And now it's my turn.
Logic says, I shoot Colby.
Right, because if I'm still standing, I'm gonna shoot you.
- And I don't miss.
- Exactly.
As the worst, I use the two better shooters against each other.
Vanguard and Tooner know each other's communication skills better than we do.
So we can use that against them.
We insert our info into their systems and make it work for us.
[POPS LIPS]
CHARLIE:
We created a target that Tooner can't resist.
And we made sure that Vanguard knows about it.
A setup?
That's not gonna be obvious?
Not the way we're doing it.
They'll both think they've got data the other side doesn't know they have.
Well, these guys are gonna come ready for war, so we better gear up.
We're using their hate against each other.
It's kind of ironic.
Oh, hey, I don't hate you.
What?
You hate me?
Only when you call me Eppsy.
Oh, I guess it's a way of dealing with who you are.
What do you mean, who I am?
Charles Eppes, the guy everyone talks about.
You know, you're a pretty intimidating person.
That's the second time today I've gotten that.
Only the second?
Well, you're fairly challenging yourself there, Marshall.
Seriously, every time I come up with something new in the back of my mind I'm thinking, "Penfield's gonna tear this apart."
No, you're just saying this to be nice.
How about a truce?
Is this some game-theory trick?
If it was, I would be using a fourth level altruism ploy, right?
- It's a truce then.
- All right.
- How does it look?
MAN [OVER PHONE]:
All clear.
TOONER:
Okay.
Twenty-two hundred cell phones, 800 iPods.
Like going to a supermarket.
Sixty-inch plasma TVs, 32 to be exact.
Okay, let's get to work.
Get these things open, come on.
Now.
MAN 1:
Go, go.
MAN 2:
Hey, get down.
Well.
Well, that had to be disappointing.
What?
You're fighting us with bombs you cooked up in chem lab?
Well, how did you think this was going to end?
What, you college boys can do what the L.A.P.D. And the FBI can't?
Huh?
Huh?
[HELICOPTER WHIRRING]
DAVID:
FBI!
Put the detonator down.
[SIRENS WAILING]
[COPS SHOUTING]
Tooner, drop it, drop it right now!
AGENT:
Don't move.
Put your weapon on the ground.
Tooner.
Eat it.
We killed you.
[LAUGHS]
He's gone.
[LAUGHING]
We killed you.
You're done.
So, Marshall, how did you like your second taste of FBI work?
Oh, it was terrific.
With the exception of meeting the psychotic killer face-to-face.
- I didn't like that.
- That wasn't optimal.
No, it was not.
Oh, you two don't seem to be fighting as much.
Is that on purpose or did you just get tired of it?
No, it's on purpose, I never tire from an argument.
Yes, well, that's all too apparent.
Marshall and I have found we can actually get along, huh?
Yes, I should have stopped calling you Eppsy years ago.
It's all right, I've been called worse.
Hey, everyone.
What do you say, Chuck?
- Like that.
- Chuck?
- Yeah.
- Like that.
I'm gonna work with that.
I beleive what we all beleive, and I believe that there is no higher calling than that of public service.
And where others see the State Senate as a steppingstone to higher office, let me assure you,
I can see no greater service to the people I love.
911.
What's your emergency?
There's a man with a gun at the Quincy Hotel.
...making California safe to threats from without and within.
Hey, Bill.
Don.
Thanks for coming, guys.
Chippies are stretched thin today.
We could use more eyes out there.
So what's the deal?
Why's the Senator still here with a death threat?
He wouldn't let us pull him out.
So we have absolutely no control over who's already been let in.
Let's get the uplink to my people.
Why don't you guys hit the floor.
All right.
...by a series of reforms designed to overturn 30 years of misguided optimism about the heart of a criminal and what resides there.
Thank you.
God bless you all and God bless the great state of California.
All right, guys, here comes the uplink.
Now.
I'm up.
Yeah, so are we.
I've been waiting for an opportunity to give my crowd dynamics program a shakedown.
Look, if this works, the security applications alone are staggering
It's amazing.
We're getting a real-time analysis of movement patterns, ongoing flow rate projections.
We're looking for a male, one male, probably with a handgun.
Lot of people in the area.
Hope you guys can narrow it down.
I'm fishing for body language and microexpressions, but with this many people, it's really just fishing.
Charlie?
Look, the software we're using is designed to determine corridor flow, maximize efficiency of ingress and egress.
You know, but what's really interesting here are the continuum approximations.
By analyzing the crowd as if it were a liquid-like substance...
We're looking for anomalies, like someone breaking the pattern of the reception line.
I think they're too fast and close for a shot at the senator.
Do you see that?
All right, we'd better double-check it against high-density, bidirectional flow results.
Charlie, there's a time for double-checking and a time to make an educated guess.
Okay, then, we have an unaccountable congestion near a center table.
I have a male Asian, 60s, near the center table.
The body language is right.
He has slumped shoulders and a slack expression.
He's holding his jacket with his right hand.
Two o'clock, two o'clock.
I got him.
FBI!
Get down!
Move!
?
Down on the ground.
Put it down!
Put it down!
Right now!
Don't do that!
Don't do it!
Vanh Minh, former Vietnamese citizen.
Joined the Vietcong at age 15, eventually became a recon platoon leader in Dinh Tuong.
Senator Tallman was in the Army, right?
In the '60s?
Never went to Vietnam.
Never even went overseas.
As far as we can tell, these two men never even met each other.
All right, so this guy disappears in '68, resurfaces in '78... as a US citizen?
Wait, how's he pull that off?
He's not a registered voter.
He has no political affiliation whatsoever.
I mean, it looks like a... classic lone gunman.
Yeah, but why kill a politician you don't even know?
Doesn't make any damn sense.
Landlord says that Minh paid his rent on time and kept to himself and fixed his own faucet.
Yep, and he kept a diary.
All in French, so I think we're gonna need a translator.
He planned this thing out in advance.
He bought the suit, the tie, and the shoes a week ago.
Even had time to get the pants taken in.
Well, careful prep is consistent with the murder-suicide.
"Brutus climbed into my mind and stopped me from functioning as a normal person."
Wow, she speaks French.
She dated a hockey player.
"Before Brutus, I was curious and intelligent."
You know, Brutus could be a code word for Tallman.
Yeah.
Did he happen to mention what he had against this guy?
He might not have had a specific grudge.
He's showing manifestations of schizophrenia.
Non-existent relationships, repressed rage.
And medication.
Nice grab.
:
Thanks.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.
That's speed.
Well, abuse would explain high levels of aggression.
Yep.
Answers a lot of questions.
Yeah, and begs a few more like who prescribed this and for what.
Yeah.
Also, why was he receiving pension checks from the Army?
The United States Army.
Your mail.
Oh, thanks again for us e of your address, Charles.
Since the steam tunnels,
Professor Mildred has cut off all use of my faculty mailboxes.
And the... the magazine.
Charles.
Yeah.
I-I believe this is my copy of the Quarterly Review of Cosmology.
Yeah, it is.
Why are we engaged in combat over it?
Well, be
- I'll tell- because-
There's, there's something on the cover that may very well, um- no, it is,it is going to upset you.
I was going to throw it out, and then I figured you'd find it sooner or later.
Just give it to me already.
"Igby's Law Redefines Gravity Flux Motivated by Sound Wave Propagation in Bose-Einstein Condensates."
Professor Johannes Igby?
Um, I know you publicly disputed Igby's approach.
The man is an anthropic imbecile.
You know, so what i- if, if he's been proven right?
He's had a law named after him.
So what if he's been put on the short list for the National Medal of Science Award?
He has?
It's on page 87.
So look, I mean, it, it may sting a little bit, you know, at first, but, um...
You're smiling.
I am?
Are you, are you in stunned shock?
It's okay.
I'll call the campus medic.
Actually, don't do that.
Tell you what you can do.
Take over my Computational Physics class.
Well, the last time I covered that class, one of your students...
Thank you so much, Charles.
911.
There is a man with a gun at the Quincy Hotel.
Can I have your name?
He is going to kill Senator Martin Tallman.
It may already be too late.
No, I mean, he doesn't sound 60 and he doesn't sound Vietnamese.
No.
Voice recognition says male, Caucasian, 25 to 40.
And that call came in at 12:17 from a pay phone in the lobby.
By that time, Minh was already in the ballroom.
Autopsy results are in.
Death from a gunshot wound to Minh's head.
We need an autopsy to tell us that?
I was actually more interested in the pathology.
ME confirmed
Minh had been taking large doses of dextroamphetamine sulfate.
That prescription was written on a stolen pad.
Which suggests intentional abuse.
It's like he was getting himself angry enough to kill Tallman.
Did you get anywhere with the pension checks?
No, the VA had no records on him, so I pulled in a favo r who's pulling in a favor.
And your favor's favor called me.
Agent Eppes.
Raymond, Central Intelligence.
We need to talk.
Yeah all right.
Let's take a little walk.
We'd be interested in doing an information share on the Tallman assassination.
Uh-huh.
Why are you guys so interested in a California State Senator?
Vanh Minh's citizenship and pension were functions of work he performed for us during Vietnam.
What, double agent?
I couldn't say.
Well, see, you know, as file-sharing goes, we're off to a bad start here.
I mean...
What I mean is I don't know.
Minh was part of a defunct program from a war we lost 30 years ago.
So what are you saying?
The guy was in the wind for 25 years?
And now he's front page news.
And I'd like to know what kind of damage control we're looking at.
No chest beating, just a request to keep a colleague in the loop.
All right, fair enough.
Thanks.
Minh's.38 was one of three purchased at a Nevada gun store last month.
Buyer used a stolen ID.
The store's name is Longan Ammo.
On the ATF's watch list.
Have a reputation for playing things a little fast and loose when it comes to background checks and waiting periods.
We got a straw purchase.
Yeah, then he sold it off to Minh.
What do we got?
A white male, 30s.
You really think we have some kind of conspiracy going on?
I don't know.
I think we'd better find those other two guns.
So, a black market dealer sends a buyer into a gun store.
Right, in this case, with a fake ID.
And the buyer purchases multiple guns legally...
Mm-hmm.
And then returns them to the dealer?
Yeah, it's called a straw purchase.
Gun stores can do that?
Just sell pistols to anyone with money?
They're not supposed to, but these people can find a way to make a buck.
I know what you're thinking.
An inductive application of the network effect.
Starting from Metcalfe's law?
No, you know how I feel about Metcalfe's law.
You know, it's value - based, so in my opinion, it just, it vastly overst...
Hi.
Can we come in?
This is perfect.
Where's Alan?
He's in Oakland until Monday.
Yeah, he's, he's over there consulting on a waterfront renovation project...
Um...
I think maybe we should wait.
No, we can't wait.
Wait for what?
Um, Larry has some really big news.
I'm leaving Cal Sci.
I'm leaving Los Angeles in fact, more specifically,
I will be leaving the planet Earth, though I will remain in orbit...
Okay.
If you don't tell them, I'm going to.
I will be on the next shuttle to the International Space Station leaving roughly three weeks from now.
You are not...
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, hold on.
What?
You must have suspected something.
I mean with my unorthodox living situations, my unexplained absences.
I thought that was you being...
You.
No.
And you knew about this?
Well, I knew he was taking more trips to Houston.
But no, I never pierced the "veil of mystery."
Yes, I guess my work in the cosmic microwave background had some relevance to the NSA's satellite signals technology and, uh, they contacted me last September.
Last September?
Yes.
Handshakes transpired, oaths were taken and the long and the short of it is that I was made alternate payload specialist.
He's going on the space shuttle for six months.
Wow.
Why didn't you ever say anything?
Because it was always just such a long shot, but with the recent good fortune of the original payload specialist, Johannes Igby,
Igby's Law. his new responsibilities sadly prevent him from taking his seat on the shuttle.
So, so T-Minus?
Um, we're scheduled for departure on the 7th.
I will be leaving for Houston next week for final training and my flight physical.
Larry's got the right stuff.
All right, I'm getting some champagne.
Congratulations, Larry.
Oh, thank you.
So why Chicago?
Do not know.
Go ask my publisher.
I think you've got a girl there.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
Girl in every port.
Mmm.
To a girl in every port.
Can I help you?
No, Stan!
Stan.?
Male, Hispanic, 40s.
The guy walks up to this table, puts five shots into the victim, turns the gun on himself, misfires, walks away.
Sounds a lot like the Tallman shooting.
LAPD detective made the same connection.
So they checked the serial number against our straw purchase.
Do we have a match?
Yeah, you think I'm going to call you out here, on your night off if we don't?
Victim is Stanford Davis.
This is his wife.
He's a psychiatrist.
Just wrote a book called New Methods of Operant Conditioning and Its Impact on Neuroanatomy.
I'll wait for the movie.
Yeah.
One gun purchase has given us two execution-style murders.
And one and a half suicides.
You used Metcalfe's Law after all.
You know, no one likes to hear "I told you so." Okay.
What are those?
It's a second gun from a shooting last night.
I'm tracing the past patterns of transaction s across the network and it's-it's revealing some very predictable dynamics.
It's really something- about Larry.
What, the whole, uh... space station thing?
Yeah, you seemed a little, uh...
A little what?
I don't know... upset?
U pset?
What do you mean?
No, I'm-I'm upset?
Of course not.
I'm not upset.
I mean maybe I would be if I thought he was actually going to go through with it.
Larry asked Dr. Finch for a leave of absence.
I mean he put his car in storage.
I have known Larry Fleinhardt for 15 years.
He's not going anywhere.
I think you should talk to him.
Why?
There's nothing to talk about.
Besides I've got to present my findings to Don, so...
Shooter left a pretty good print on the strap.
It comes back to...
Carlos Costavo.
He came to the US from Cuba with the 1980 Marielito exodus.
All right, so political refugee or a criminal?
No, he's definitely a criminal.
He got here, spent ten years at Chino for robbery and assault.
Costavo.
He hasn't been home in three days.
But we did find government pension checks and dextroamphetamine sulfate.
Same as Minh.
Yeah.
Something really strange is going on here.
We've got the same MO, and same medication.
Senator, psychiatrist, a Vietnamese POW, a Cuban refugee.
And the guns.
Right.
Well, looks like I'm right on time.
So we have a list of gun sales from Longan Ammo, going back about two years and the suspected straw purchases are here in red.
And this is ATF's list of suspected street-level gun dealers and their sales patterns.
Now, what I did was I applied networking theory to a directed graph, using the source and known nodes to determine the sink.
Which is kind of like...
Kind of like... kind of like, oh, kind of like a telephone, which is actually the classic example of networking.
Okay, so we have stores and purchasers, dealers and buyers.
They're all part of the same network.
Right.
Now, what I did was study the call patterns, the straw purchases and I listened for the ringing telephone.
Now, I'm going to call a bullpen extension right now;
and how about you guys tell me which one I'm calling.
Oh, it could be about half a dozen phones right now.
So we've already narrowed down the possibilities considerably.
The more calls
I make... the easier it becomes to find the right one.
Hello.
Yeah, sorry, I'm just demonstrating networking theory.
She hung up.
So... the ringing phone we're looking for is the black market dealer, who bought the three guns.
I was actually looking for patterns of distribution, arrests that connect to straw sales according to time and proximity, not to mention the kind of weapons transacted.
Now by looking at the way that Longan Ammo made straw gun sales and then the appearance of the guns on the street...
You came up with a name.
Off of Senator
Tallman's shooting, I came up with four names, and given the second shooting,
I was able to narrow it down:
Sam Finney, a major gun dealer.
FBI.
You're under arrest.
FBI?
What'd I do to you guys?
You picked up the wrong phone.
Automatic weapons
RPGs... if you do time by the bullet, you got some problems here.
Yeah.
And you can make them all go away, right?
Nah,
I think that would take like a presidential pardon.
But I'll tell you something, Sam, you help me, maybe I get it down to five to ten.
I won't wear a wire.
Three Smith Wesson Model 64s, bought in Nevada last month.
Longan Ammo.
Guy runs the place like he's selling socks...
Get your hands back on the table.
Where'd they end up?
Some guy.
Guy.
All right, Sam.
Marcus.
All right, his name was Marcus.
Tried to move him up to Glocks, but he said he wanted to keep it simple.
Did he say what he wanted them for?
Yeah, they're a little expensive for paperweights, you know what I mean?
Yeah, that's funny.
I didn't ask.
That's it?
That's what you got for me?
Brown hair, blue eyes, 40, maybe 45.
Real quiet, talked like he was in a library.
All right, sit tight.
Keep your hands on the table.
Yeah, right.
Problem with these Identikit pictures, they're only as good as the description.
And Finney's wasn't great.
Hey, it's what we got, you know.
Okay, Stanford Davis was a prison psychologist at Chino from 1983 to 1985.
Wait, Costavo was there from 1981 to 1991, so, so they knew each other.
Yeah, and here's a little-known fact about the California Penal system:
they have a long and proud history of experimenting on prisoners.
And, uh, pharmaceutical companies test on inmates.
Yeah, but that's voluntarily, and in pretty limited circumstances.
I'm talking about behavior modification programs, sensory deprivation, chemical treatment, psychosurgery, many of which are underwritten by the Department of Defense, where the CIA friend came.
Including one "Brutus Project,"
which Davis worked on.
The same Brutus as in Minh's journal?
And the same Davis as in the shrink who was our second victim.
Julius Caesar's assassin's full name was Marcus Brutus.
Finney said he sold guns to a guy named Marcus.
So, now we've connected
Costavo to Davis, possibly to Minh.
Guess which State Senator has been pushing legislation through a repeal to ban on prison testing?
Uh, Tallman.
A equals B equals
C equals D; it's like one of Charlie's equations.
Can't believe I just said that.
Spring cleaning?
No.
As per Dr. Finch's request, I have now thoroughly vacated my lair.
I do take some comfort however, in remanding my few prized possessions into the custody of my closest friend.
Aw, well, thanks.
What do we got in here?
Oh, wow, the Newton Lacy Award.
My goodness.
Uh...
Of course, uh, some jazz recordings.
Of course.
An old... yeah, an old T-shirt.
Old T-shirt, worn on the day I first posited causal solutions to ultrahyperbolic wave equations and more memorably, when I vanquished Professor Musgrave at the Cal Sci's Texas Hold 'Em tournament.
Wow, then this is one lucky shirt.
Yeah, well, not to dwell on the negatives.
I am mindful of the risk involved in sitting atop two million liters of combusted liquid hydrogen and oxygen.
Larry.
Do you remember... when I was in my junior year and, uh, I decided to grow my moustache out?
The word "moustache" would be a charitable characterization.
You said that my follicle count failed to achieve critical mass.
That's... dear... sorry.
No, you were being brutally honest with me, you know.
And sometimes friends have to be brutally honest with each other.
Larry... you know this thing isn't really going to happen.
Because?
People die in space shuttles, Larry.
You know and at some point you're going to make a rational assessment of this situation.
You're going to realize that shooting yourself out of a cannon would just be feckless waste.
Let me get this right.
You are actually comparing my brushing the heavens with your barely postpubescent moustache.
No, I'm just being realistic.
It's a very fortunate thing for you that I am on the verge of fulfilling one of life's dreams.
Fortunate for me?
That's correct.
Because were I in a less ebullient frame of mind,
I might well just bop you in the nose.
Excuse me.
Have you ever heard of MK-ULTRA?
What, that's a CIA program in the, what, '50s.
LSD, mind control...
Right, right, LSD was part of it.
But they tried sensory deprivation, radiation, ELF.
Uh-huh.
What's that?
Extreme Low Frequency.
Certain pulses can actually affect a subject's emotional state.
MK-ULTRA was one of many programs.
Right, like Brutus?
The idea was to program enemy agents with posthypnotic suggestions, then send them home as sleeper assassins.
Assassins.
Programmed to kill themselves after the assassination, keeping the program invisible.
All right, so Minh's Vietcong...
Who we never officially identified as a POW.
Costavo:
Marielito.
Someone figured they could get him close to Castro.
See, the thing is, Brutus never worked.
30 years of experiments never produced a single viable candidate.
So the program was discontinued, the subjects cut loose.
Yeah, with pensions.
Well, I mean, that last gun's for somebody connected to all this.
Right!
I've compiled a list of subjects known to be in the Los Angeles area.
If Marcus has gotten the Brutus conditioning to work- and it looks like he has- every one of these men is a potential weapon.
What's this list?
Anyone who ever worked on Brutus.
Marcus didn't just pick his killers from the program, but his victims, too.
Marcus is sending the lab rats after the scientists.
712 subjects in one mind - control experiment in just Los Angeles?
No telling how many the Soviets worked on during the same time period.
Oh, that's a really good
Cold War way of thinking.
They're doing something bad, so let's do something worse and bigger.
Please.
Why didn't you tell us about this after the first shooting?
Why would you try and protect a failed program?
You want to see how Marcus got it to work.
Think about it.
You capture a terrorist, you condition him, you send him back to his cell- bang.
"Condition" is a really polite word for "torture."
When you're fighting for a way of life, you use whatever weapon is available.
And before you know it, you've given up your way of life.
Charlie, what...?
We got people for this.
What are you doing?
What your people are doing, they're trying to match a rudimentary sketch against thousands of CIA personnel files.
What I'm doing here is trying to save you time and increase success potential considerably.
Now, by weighting the value of the search criteria to look for slight deviations- say Finney chose eyebrow set #33- what I'm doing is, I'm allowing the possibility of a near-miss.
Eyebrow set 32, set 34.
All right, cool.
Well, thanks.
Hey, um, are you guys planning any kind of party or anything for Larry?
He's not going anywhere.
Well, I don't know about that, Charlie.
He sure seems to be going someplace.
:
Don... can you seriously picture
Lawrence Fleinhardt in outer space?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I mean, more than anyone else I know.
Things change.
I mean, that's the way life is.
People get married; they move on.
I'm aware of that, Don.
I do notice that nowhere on that list did you include "fly away in a rocket ship."
Charlie, I'm just saying, I know it can be tough.
The toughest part is...
The toughest part is sitting around while people fuel his delusion.
You see, 'cause that's not gonna help him any when reality ultimately sets in.
His delusion.
All right, if you say so.
Very impressive.
Mens sana in corpore sano.
So, what do you think?
Am I being too short-sighted in my acceptance of this mission?
Are you kidding?
I mean, setting aside the experiment itself, there's no telling what kinds of insight...
No, no, no, no.
Talking about my abdication of my life, my responsibilities, my burgeoning relationship.
You know, there's some parallels here to your own dilemma-
Harvard versus Cal Sci, Charles.
Well, the difference was,
Harvard wasn't offering me the better job.
What if they had?
It's only six months.
And Megan seems genuinely supportive.
Yeah, whereas your beau...
I don't know.
He seems to think that an 11th hour rethink will reveal my ambition to be... well, I believe the word "feckless" was used.
You know, he's never dreamt of something he couldn't reach.
So he has no idea what it's like to want something that you might not be able to get.
So how could he understand how much you'd give up if this chance comes along?
I know.
I know.
You ready?
What?
Let's go.
Give me the bottle.
Got to take a leak anyway.
You guys are Parole, right?
Drug test?
FBI.
Questions.
About Carlos Costavo.
You and he bunked together in Chino?
Chino was three mistakes ago.
I'm way too old for a fourth.
Contact with discreditable persons gets me sent back for the rest of my nickel.
So does lying to the FBI.
His phone records have your number on them.
He calls me from time to time.
Mostly to complain.
About?
Excuse me.
Whichever boss...
Come on, come on, come on.
Whichever boss or girlfriend or stranger ticked him off this week.
Guy's always had a short fuse, you know.
Headaches.
Headaches?
Some kind of drug therapy or something in stir, got six years dinged off his bid.
Wasn't like he was right in the head in the first place, but...
You got any idea how we can get in touch with him?
Does it help me or hurt me if I do?
He spends a lot of time at MacArthur park.
Watches the old men play chess.
Thanks.
Chess tables are right up here.
And you know that because...
'Cause I spent 13 months in a tent.
It's either chess or skin rags.
Hey, check it out.
FBI!
Move!
Back!
He ran into the garage!
Carlos!
Get down!
Carlos don't do it.
Do not jump Carlos.
Hey!
Carlos!
Carlos!
Carlos.
Who are you?
A guy who doesn't want to see you get hurt, all right?
Well, you're 20 years too late.
I've tried to do this before, you know.
Never quite took the last step.
Because you don't want to.
And then the one time, the one time I go through with it, the damned gun misfires.
But maybe... maybe this time, I finally make it.
Look at me, Carlos!
Look at me!
Look at me!
I don't want to do anything.
Just want to talk to you.
Okay?
Give me two minutes.
Go on and do whatever you got to, okay?
Just talk?
Just want to talk.
You lied to me!
David, apologize to the man for saving his life.
The things that sick bastard did...
You volunteered.
Yeah, well, after the first electroshock treatment,
I tried to un-volunteer.
Davis said they'd put the six years back on and another 25 for violating a federal agreement.
That was a quarter of a century ago.
Why'd you go after him now?
That's when the government guy came around.
Marcus.
Marcus said he was working for the government?
Said he was a doctor.
Some kind of posttraumatic follow-up program.
Kind of late for that.
He gave me some drugs, but they didn't work.
Dextroamphetamine sulfate.
He said I was clinically depressed, that they would help.
I mean, the more we talked, the madder I got!
And that was...
Sit down.
He let slip where Davis worked.
And I started following him.
Gustavo, where'd you get the gun from?
Gun?
Yeah.
I
- I don't know.
I don't remember.
One day, it was just there, on my bed.
Look, you know, I'm really tired.
These headaches, they make it so hard to sleep.
I mean, it boggles the mind.
I mean, they give speed to a guy who's mentally disturbed, hand him a gun, and then point him toward the people who tortured him.
Yeah, it's not exactly brainwashing, but it's not exactly different.
What do you think?
Revenge or blackmail?
Trying to show us what he can do?
He's got to have some kind of psychological background.
He knew exactly which subjects to pick.
He knew exactly which buttons to push.
CIA says there was no program that even remotely resembles the one he was talking about.
I'm gonna go back to the original people that worked on the program.
Maybe Marcus is on the list of victims somewhere.
Hold on a second.
You all right?
About Larry?
You know, it's hard to feel badly when you feel so proud.
But, yeah, the timing sucks.
Why do you ask?
I don't know.
Charlie seems to be struggling...
I just thought...
I'm just trying to take care of my own, that's all.
:
Oh, well, that would explain that throbbing vein in the middle of your forehead.
Thank you.
Well, I'm here if you need me.
Costavo's description isn't exactly the same as Finney's, is it?
It's a big break for us because more data is always better data.
So by weighting the commonalities between the sketches...
Oh, like if the same chin comes up twice, then it's probably the right chin.
I've actually tried to make this algorithm even more sophisticated.
So were looking for values that fall in a common range, not just perfect matches.
Since we've already inventoried the facial points of all of the potential suspects, we should whittle our way down to a few candidates relatively.
Didn't see that coming.
Uh, are you sure this is every person with access to the Brutus files?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Feels to me like were missing something so obvious we must've forgotten about it.
You know, can't see the forest for the...
Trees.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No.
So when Charlie's filter returned zero matches, we realized...
"We"?
Yeah, "we."
We realized that what we have is a classic example of Euclid's Orchard.
You see, because each perspective of an orchard is unique, not only giving us information about the trees but about the position of the observer.
We started from Minh and Costavo and worked our way backward.
Figuring out where all the information about their participation in the Brutus program existed, and who might have been privy to it.
The common denominator was the Freedom of Information Act.
Guys, Brutus was top secret.
You're right, but portions of it were declassified, in the 1970s with MK-ULTRA.
And then again in the '90s, they made more of it public with the class action suit against Chino.
There were a few dozen people who had access to these files.
One of them in particular...
Lawrence Dryden.
He's a practicing psychiatrist in Santa Monica.
Now he happens to have a brother named Porter, who actually served time in Chino in'89.
This guy Porter was definitely a patient of Davis's?
Brother Lawrence certainly seemed to think so.
He filed suit against the US in 2000, but the case was dismissed in '03.
Where are the Dryden brother now?
Porter OD'd and died four years ago.
Lawrence still lives on the west side.
Most significantly, my facial recognition algorithm shows us that Lawrence Dryden is an 87% match to our sketches of Marcus.
Dryden, step out.
We got a search and arrest warrant for you.
Let's go, guys.
Turn around.
Of course, of course.
Go ahead and look.
The guns aren't here.
You want to save us some time and tell us where they are?
Where they'll do the most good.
You haven't changed anything;
after this next killing, the truth will have to come out.
I want the third gun?
You think I'm a killer?
I'm not.
I'm a hero.
And how is that?
Because I'm willing to make hard decisions and suffer the consequences for a greater good.
My brother was no saint, but what they did to him should never happen, not here, not in this country.
Your brother OD'd 14 years after Brutus was over.
Porter never used heroin, not until after Chino.
It was the pain from those experiments that drove him to the drugs.
I went through the courts, I went through the press.
Everyone either didn't believe it or didn't care.
After all, these men are just prisoners.
So I knew if I wanted to stop Brutus, that I'd have to take stronger measures.
It's has been over for years.
They're planning to do it again.
Who?
Tallman was lobbying for relaxing California's restrictions on prisoner experiments, and that sadist Davis, offering his so-called expert testimony.
I just turned their own monsters against them.
And why's that?
You couldn't pull the trigger yourself?
No, these men have already been destroyed by Brutus.
In death, think of how many other lives they can save.
That sounds to me exactly what the CIA probably said when they started the whole thing to begin with.
So you tell me, what's the difference between them and you?
Hey.
Hey.
I'm not going to apologize for expressing my opinion.
Well, I'm not going to apologize for choosing to ignore it.
You got an interesting problem there.
Yeah, yeah.
It's based on a subject, Lawrence Dryden's, access to Freedom of Information files.
See, he had his pick of any of two dozen potential assassins, and I'm just trying to narrow down those candidates down by accessibility, by health, predisposition.
I just don't think I can be narrow enough, quickly enough.
Have you considered incorporating target selection theory?
You mean Von Neumann and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Well, actually, before then,
Von Neumann's acolytes had been doing work, more applicable I think, in the arena of conventional bombing.
The theory being that if you kept bombing high-value targets,over time, the enemy would concentrate their defenses there.
But if you bombed low-value targets, yeah, you'd siphon off some of their defenses, but over time, you would sacrificing manpower, gasoline, deplete your bomb supplies.
So you're suggesting, and as always, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, that I analyze not only potential killers, but potential victims as well.
The list of people publicly endorsing increased prisoner experimentation.
So refining my previous analysis of Dryden's motivations and assessment of his likelihood for success...
Well, Larry, you are gone.
Don.
I just finished my target select theory analysis.
The most probable next victim is an army colonel who served at Leavenworth.
He supervised experiments on military prisoners for the Brutus Project.
Great, Charlie.
Megan's got the colonel, and I'm on my way to clear his house now.
What about the killer?
He's a man named Gates.
He was one of the prisoners at Leavenworth.
Got it, Charlie.
I've got David and Colby on their way to pick up Gates.
He's not here.
Drop it now!
Drop it!
Guys, guys, we're clear.
Now that we have Marcus and all three guns,
I guess this case is closed.
What are you talking about?
We don't even know who else Dryden got to.
Case closed?
Okay, maybe I misspoke.
We're not going to allow you to open up any more lines of investigation.
Say what?
This is a national security issue.
You're going to cover this up, aren't you?
This was never about the past; this is about the future.
So Dryden was right?
Tallman was pushing prison testing legislation?
This is just a back door to restart Brutus?
You've got to be kidding me.
What are you going to do with him, stick him in Guantanamo so he can't talking to anyone?
Your assistance has been appreciated, but this doesn't have to do with you anymore.
I shot a man tonight.
And your country thanks you.
I'd stay down unless you want to get hit again.
The night of the 18th,
I will be right there, between Cancer and Leo Minor, visible for roughly 14 seconds.
Hmm.
Then I'll have to get a telescope.
I guess I could pull strings, get you access to Cal Sci's Celestron.
Maybe I'd like to watch you from my own bedroom, by myself.
Listen... you know, I realize our relationship hasn't been exactly... forward-leaning.
I do want you to know my heart will remain yours in my absence.
While you're in a space capsule with three guys?
I should hope so.
You know what I mean.
I do know what you mean.
But maybe for tonight, we should just... lean forward a little.
Charlie?
He's really going to do it, isn't he?
He's going to go.
He's going to go.
The City of Photographers
When I was a child my father would cut a tea box and turn it into a camera.
After that, I could play, pretending to be a photographer.
My father was part of a batch of photographers schooled in the streets, shaped by the riots.
He never told me about his role out there
But I got to know what was going on in the city Looking at his photos, and those of his friends.
- Juanito is absent today.
- Long live the Galindo, man!
- Juanito?
- Juanito is not here.
Do you remember what year that was?
I visit my father at Universidad de Chile's photo lab.
He's been working here for thirty years.
It's here where I learned the story of The Photographers.
This is what's left of the lab.
These cameras are about forty years old.
Lt's been three year since we don't make prints ...now it's a kitchen.
And here's the non-official story of this archive.
Lt is so because part of the story of the AFI took place right here in this lab.
This is Lucho Navarro's photo of Lonquén.
One of the very first denouncement photos in those dictatorship days.
Luis Navarro worked as a photographer for The Vicaría, the Church's Rectory, then.
The very first time I saw this photograph I imagined a castle.
Long time after that I learned it was a mine full of dead people.
Everything's so changed now.
L must of have gone in there at least 20 times.
Every time remains where moved, we had to go in.
They would cover my nose with a handkerchief.
M y mouth too.
And I crawled...
on my back.
Till I got placed under an arch.
To this height, not more.
That distance away from me.
And there above their socks were hanging.
They made sounds.
All I did was describe a ratio with the camera a full ratio, measuring.
Then I would come out.
L had to move my foot when I couldn't hold my breath any more.
There were 15 bodies in there.
Every day people vine workers with no... political relevance whatsoever.
There were 5 of them from one family 3 more...
And they buried them... alive.
A silenced issue then, out of respect for their kin.
L knew them thru photographs.
Thru the photos I made when their relatives were still looking for them.
L made pictures of all the Maureiras, because of the specific case of the town of Isla de Maipo.
Lt then happens that the shirt of one of them became engraved in my mind.
The shirt of one of the youngest Maureiras.
That night, when we arrived at The Vicaría a meeting was being held by the Bishops and heads of the Rectory.
They were gathered downstairs, and I was told to develop right away.
L went upstairs to develop and blow up my material.
Later I called Javier Mella and Cristián Precht, and told them those were the people missing from Isla de Maipo.
Be careful, they told me.
Are you sure?
See this shirt?
L said.
When I made the photos of the desaparecidos... the pattern of that shirt caught my eye.
And this is it.
So we knew from day one who that people was.
The people from here, I mean.
Well, it's been years since then.
Since I have all these photos of the boys.
And of the other people downstairs too.
Lt's been hard to have them done, but they're done.
L have an altar both downstairs and upstairs.
The downstairs pictures were expensive.
They're oil pictures.
There's Sergio Manuel Rodolfo Antonio Segundo Armando and José Manuel.
Those are my four missing ones.
To say it straight, not missing, but killed.
They're dead.
Years later they were found at the mines in Lonquén.
They were hanging head first, like slaughtered pigs.
They were pushed into a shaft and remained hanging.
The mouth full of grass, tied with barbwires.
Their mouths, hands, feet...
I have always been fond of the pictures of my sons.
When I'm alone I make believe they are alive.
L talk to them.
And they sort of talk back to me.
But it's a mother's thing.
L have so much memories of them.
So many...
Since the first moment this was discovered Chile becomes aware of the horror.
L think this became a symbol, for it was the first.
Pinochet starts to stagger in 1978.
First thing, he loses credibility, the disappearance of civilians becomes a fact.
That's the importance of Lonquén.
Lamb of God you take away the sins of the world have mercy on us.
Lamb of God...
I declare myself a photographer of the losers and the dead.
That's the part of life I was called into.
My call...
It was were I was at that time.
Defending those without a voice, those who had lost their freedom.
Those who were being tyrannized, those being tortured and martyrized.
That was my task, and I have no regrets for I can't think of nothing more ennobling for a person to do...
Than defend those who has fallen.
Lt's not easy.
Yes, here.
This is it.
Yes.
Where's the city photographed by my father?
What were the things he saw in it and that are not her anymore?
What has vanished?
"THERE'S TORTURE IN CHILE"
Every dweller of this land ought to ponder how meaningful it is to live in a country where peace reigns.
When we started, I guess we mostly wanted a credential.
Not for exposition purposes, but to work.
To be able to go out on the streets and photograph those first demonstrations.
We're talking 1981 here.
We need some sort of accreditation.
So we created the Independent Photographers Guild Association abbreviated in spanish as AFI.
Someone called it the Leftist Photographers Guild, the AFI
It was a human gathering instance where we could talk about what was happening to us.
And to see what could be done for all those who did not have a credential, and who played important roles too, against the dictatorship and could be sheltered by some accreditation, by a lawyer to bail them out if they got arrested.
And that entity was the AFI.
And then I think, every photographer joined the AFI.
What's beautiful, you know, about that, is this sort of rescue of each other.
The acknowledgment, the recognition of all those becoming photographers.
L think that many of us started using that title thanks to the AFI.
L mean, we dared to call ourselves photographers.
Lt was a work that, besides everything, was helping to put an end to the tyranny.
L don't mean to be arrogant, but we began to realize how important those photographs were as documents.
No wonder they were after us!
"Apsi Magazine Photographer Suffers Aggression"
As the President of Apsi, several times, I had to place habeas corpus petitions when colleagues got arrested...
To somehow prevent people disappearance.
They used to beat us.
To somehow prevent that people disappear.
They used to beat us.
Several times I ended at a hospital with a broken head.
That was how hard things were.
L was quite frightened.
Unlike men who would face the police.
L was frightened.
Besides I was from a Brazil.
Every day there was no way of knowing what could become of you.
What that day was holding for you.
Every day you would wake up with your adrenaline pumping.
In such a way that exhaustion could never reach you, never at all.
Don't shoot!
I'm a journalist!
Don't take him away!
Don't touch him!
Leave him, he's a journalist!
Go on!
You better kill him right away!
We were unaware of consequence or dismay.
Lf we had to be there, we were there.
Always under great risk, but aware of our importance.
Give me your film!
You had to be brave.
That's not easy when you face tyranny.
We were brave just like the dwellers and students.
We were all brave.
Everyone had the passion!
The bottom line was to defeat tyranny.
And that vision covered for anything else.
Our part was a minimum part.
Our only privilege, if we had one, was to be there and be able to protect ourselves one another.
L mean there was nothing bold or heroic about our individual selves, I think.
But we did constitute a human group.
A large group.
L think that that protected us a lot.
We started by going out in groups.
Our best shield was this group of photographers.
As we were always short on film, our shots were few, if you may.
We calculated a lot as when to shoot a photo.
Because you had a couple of film cartridges to last you all day.
You had to control...
I think we should of have done it the other way.
L don't know.
Plenty of photos were lost.
Then we started knowing other people out on the streets.
People from agencies, France Press, Reuters...
They would lend us film cartridges.
Whenever we would run out of film in the middle of a big outburst, they would help us out.
L mean, we couldn't just go home once out of film.
They also trusted us for we were always in the middle of every struggle.
We were at the middle of every act, everywhere.
So the agencies and foreign magazines started buying some of our photos.
L raised my camera and shot two frames.
Just two they were two because of I saw the two negatives.
L saw this little man, this character, as sort of a symbol of the country
He was us before this tyranny, before those tall and mighty horses, those police steeds.
And the people of those country was there walking in front of them.
Lt was some sort of irony of fate.
Back in those days those of us who reported already knew each other.
And then, all of a sudden, some new photographers which nobody knew, would appear.
Suspicion was raised about them because they could be security agents working undercover for the regime.
Taking pictures of the people.
You could spot a snitch right away.
L don't know how.
Maybe because their eyes didn't litter.
Because of those huge lens attached to their cameras, which they scarcely knew how to use.
Because of that trimmed moustache.
That gave them away for sure.
Those gloomy eyes, never talking to anyone, being always... being always on the verge.
L mean we were in the middle of things.
The days were so intense that in our monthly acquisition list ...for Hoy magazine, we would add stomach and headache pills.
For we worked everyday under pepper gas and sever stress...
What was exciting back then was you worked late to see the outcome of your photos.
In those days we developed our own material.
Those days were long...
But I can't deny the great satisfaction that taking a good picture meant.
L think that us, the photographers, helped to remove the veil of what was happening, together with others.
Mostly with anonymous people like the ones I'm interested in shooting.
Many emblematic photos portray anonymous people.
People that would go out to declare their disagreement.
And that photo would show our nonconformity with the system.
With the dictatorship.
To that matter... it became a powerful tool.
They must tell us where they are!
They must tell us where they are!
The fact that there were photographers on the street gave a sense of security for the demonstrators.
They felt more secure and at the same time completed by our presence, you see?
They were posing for the record.
Lt was something that because of that photograph of what they were doing.
What turned appalling for the regime were these photos from within.
The ways demonstrators were suppressed.
No doubt this photo is Luis' work, who else's?
Who else?
Yes this is a photo from La Vicaría.
This is also Luis'.
Those actions were taken to summon the photographers.
They were also about a lot of other things, but the photographer was indispensable.
We were in collusion with the photographers.
There was small group of female companions whose task was to get in contact with the photographers, as to tell them that day we'll do this, so to please be there.
And they showed up and the word remained guarded.
Because the police would always arrive once that...
Once we had done everything.
Lt was very hard for me.
Very hard for me to find a photo to wear on my chest.
They were four.
L couldn't find one.
Because we never had a camera at home.
By accident I have a family photo.
Because once a photographer walked down our street and asked me if I wanted a photograph.
L believe that that very same day we had nothing to eat.
We had that sort of magic miraculous inspiration to invite him in.
And that's the only picture that there is.
Then not to have a photo of your family is somehow as not having had part in the history of mankind.
Lt's sad for me.
Lt dazes me.
L can't and won't allow this to be forgotten, for instance.
Nor I can't or won't forgive...
But I think that this can't be possible.
Just that.
Now, sir, this is my son, for you to know.
A young man just as yourself.
And I start watching photographs of their beloved ones of their kin, on their lapels and I start feeling as if they were alive.
As if there's a life to unveil in there.
Here we have apprehended and missing people from date June 28, 1976 till the end of 1976.
L went through all the files and realized that not 1.197 apprehended and missing, only about 700 had a photograph.
L couldn't allow that double disappearance, so it became as some sort of duty to bring them back to life.
Ranch # 35, Huelquén.
Hello... ¡Hi!
Good afternoon, Mrs. Julita Garrido?
- That's me.
That's you?
- May I have a word with you?
- What about?
- Jorge Muñoz is your relative?
Yes, I'm the mother of José Andrés Muñoz Garrido.
- Ls it José or Jorge?
- José Andrés Muñoz Garrido.
- He's a missing person.
- Yes, his father is.
- The father?
- Yes, the father of my son.
Right, listen.
...we're looking for a photograph of the gentleman.
Because we don't have one for his file.
And right now my son is on the field.
Because he's the one who has the photos.
- Does he live here?
- Yes he lives with me.
And if you look for it?
- I'll go and see.
- Fine.
- L won't be long.
- Just take it easy.
- L have one!
- That's great!
L found two, but we're both on them.
- He's not alone.
- Never mind.
L don't know where my son keeps the others.
This is perfect.
- Your son got to know him?
- No.
- Just his photos.
- Just in photos?
- Yes.
We started finding photos of their everyday life.
From those exuberant and full of life moments.
When they were playing a piano, cutting a birthday cake loving their lovers, a teacher lecturing, a fireman parading.
We started discovering their life.
Lt was fantastic!
Lincoyán Berrios
Here's Lincoyán with his wife kids in the background, the beach.
He smoked.
Lt's a very important moment in his life.
We carry every day...
a photograph of our beloved ones in our wallets, in our purses...
we carry a picture of a girlfriend, brothers, parents, pictures of our children.
There's always an image to remember them by.
You start feeling there's also a missing person within yourself.
Within every family, within the whole of Chile there's a missing person.
I was 13 years old when Priest André Jarlan was murdered.
My Dad didn't say a word.
I heard it on the news.
Many people attended his funeral.
It was a long precession to the cemetery.
I did not attend, but seeing this picture was like being there.
"ON TO FIGHT FORA PEOPLE'S GO VERMENT"
This corner right here is quite important.
We gathered here.
The demonstrations usually took place at twelve and at one o'clock.
People started dropping leaflets over us and the activity started.
Everything was quiet as it is now and all of the sudden people began chanting:
"Bread, employment, justice, freedom"!
As they see me standing here I must seem crazy to them now.
The photographer is an invisible actor, in a way.
You go places and stare across your lens you shoot and capture the essence of a moment, maybe.
That attracted me.
This was André Jarlan's Funeral.
A very large crowd.
And... as people advanced... you see...
I was in front walking backwards.
Just so, with the camera.
Completely surrounded by people.
André, my friend, the people is at your side.
André, my friend, the people is at your side.
...go to Catedral and Manuel Rodriguez.
Catedral and Manuel Rodriguez.
The number is 1679.
That's 1679 Catedral Street.
Let me tell you that I was a photographer myself.
During the dictatorship, my friend.
By chance I worked at an important agency, France Press.
L worked there from 1985 up to 1990, covering the streets.
"Holy Father, take him away"
I happen to have my photos in the trunk.
L have an album, were those photos I told you about, are.
Here I have those pictures I mentioned, see?
L have two albums here.
This one with color pictures the other one in black and white, look.
L titled the pictures "Photo Impacts" here.
Press photos under Pinochet's dictatorship 1985 - 1990 Pepe Durán.
Here's a stabbed policeman.
He got stabbed on his neck at boulevard Ahumada.
You can see the knife.
That night I was in the corner of Alameda and Ahumada.
There's a demonstration, and suddenly a policeman collapses.
We call policemen "pacos".
Nobody knew what happened to him.
So I shot a circular picture, in order to leave out no details and at the lab, to my surprise, I saw that he had been stabbed.
No one had detected the knife, not even the photographers, because of a blackout in the area.
Of course it was also important for me since I made front page in "El Mercurio", "La Tercera","Últimas Noticias"...
All of them were after the pictures.
To my surprise, the police also called me the following day requesting material and information about that previous night.
Lt wasn't mandatory for me to help them, but out of sympathy I delivered a couple of photos, and became friends with the policeman investigating the case.
After some time he told me the case was closed.
He also told me that he had solved the case.
The person who stabbed the cop appeared in one picture.
Pretending to be a military paramedic.
But my friend discovered that he belonged to the CNI.
That was the infamous dirty war the regime was leading to give Pinochet a topic, to go on with his song:
"That's subversion, those where the communists!"
Lt became clear to me what "dirty war" meant.
A tool Pinochet's security agents would use.
L was known as the kamikaze.
Because I was always shooting pictures under the blows.
And I would stay till the very end, when the cops were exhausted.
In this square I did much more than take a photograph.
Lt was here that I faced the tyranny.
Here I saw a child whose eye had been emptied.
L saw the clash of absolute violence against people uprising.
In this square my spirit somehow hushed.
A tree bearing no fruit will be cast into the fire...
- The never ending fire!
- Amen.
Power the lord!
How about that?
Prune the tree and it'll bear fruit!
Lf the tree bears no fruit is for lack of pruning, man.
Prune it and you'll see.
We showed what the people refused to see.
But when they see a picture of reality, they know they can't deny what they see.
That starts generating a gut reaction and a soul reaction.
To me pictures were also a rescue device for those being beaten.
For the human beings being beaten.
They once grabbed a man at Ahumada and Moneda.
And I went crazy shooting my flash to make them feel observed.
L think it was then than I first knew I had a powerful weapon.
Suddenly my camera became my weapon...
Became my weapon... my weapon.
And I went out.
First you clean your lens.
You cock your camera...
just as loading an Aka.
The same shit.
Finally we got to know each other with the cops.
We even greeted each other.
Once they saw us they knew something was cooking.
"What's goanna happen?" they asked.
"Can't tell you, professional secret"
And then the shit hit the fan!
Then everything ended.
We're all tired and worn out.
Our eyes hurting because of the pepper gas all around.
And after all that, we greeted the cops goodbye.
Bizarre shit.
Much too weird.
At the end it became a game.
A very violent game that is.
A game that was not a game.
You knew that if under different circumstances you were caught by that very same friendly cop, he would beat hell out of you.
We're working here, sir.
"Freedom for the photographers Claudio Pérez and Oscar Navarro.
We... became a movement.
We became a movement for sure.
We moved this land.
Our work ended forcing them to the most preposterous measures.
At one time photos were disallowed, right?
The magazines were issued without pictures.
Something happened after some kind of riot, the government said no more photos.
"CHILE IN MO TION photos censored"
It was quite impressive, there were no photos.
No pictures at all.
But we all went on working just the same.
But we couldn't print the photos.
All those opposition magazines were censored.
So the pictures were blanks with a foot note.
You had to make the pictures in your head.
Lt had that sunny side, stimulating the fanciful aspect of having you create your own pictures.
L remember a foot note that was loads of fun.
Lt went something like "Mrs. Lucía Pinochet in her sky blue gown and feathered hat attends... something".
So you could see the old hag with her heavy make-up and the feathers...
you could even see the colors!
The situation lasted one month, two months, I'm not sure.
But I went on taking pictures.
Some of them very dear to me.
For instance Cardinal Fresno and the "The Killing Fields"
I shot that picture as a protest.
Lt was not to be published but all the same it was my protest against censorship.
"The Forbidden Edition"
"WITH ALL THE PICTURES"
Right then our society didn't want to see some things that were taking place.
TV and papers were absolutely censored, self restricted, with fear.
L think there was a very lot of fear.
So these magazines were published without photographs
And we decided to show these photos through outdoor exhibitions
We hanged the photos on our chests and went to the streets.
That's where the kid got his eye emptied.
Came a cop and hit him with his club.
And the kid covered his face like this.
And the area was covered with leaflets of a "Crusade for life"
"Crusade for life", how about that?
He covered his face.
L told him to take off his hands for a photograph.
He moves his hands...
and one of his eyes was empty
I can clearly remember a kid lying on the ground at Plaza de Armas, with an eye hanging next to his head.
His eye pulled off.
And all those photographers shooting.
And as I got near I felt I was becoming a vulture.
L basically made that association because of the blood.
Lt made a lot of sense to me then.
Together with some other things I had been considering I felt I had to retire.
Democracy was near, and what was to become of me if I turned into a blood thirsty vulture?
L resigned the following week.
We were used to react against blows, gas screams, funerals, shots...
We reacted shooting our cameras.
Lt was sort of having that violence inside you.
What a bummer it was when nothing of that happened.
You didn't know what to do.
So I was becoming some kind of bloody creep with no values.
Was I picturing pain for my own glory?
One day we realized we were losing it.
We were becoming machines of some kind.
Started feeling that violence made us be ourselves.
At first we didn't realize that.
¡Please, help me!
But when you do realize it...
it slaps you on the face.
What the hell is becoming of me.
Lf there's less repression it's because we are wining.
But adrenaline happens to be a very eerie drug, very weird.
You start needing it, and end up addicted.
Addicted to fear, addicted to overcoming your fear.
Lt's a crazy shit.
At a student's demonstration perhaps.
L don't quite recall.
There was a young lad at Alameda.
An absolute unknown to me.
With a photographer's bag.
Taking pictures.
And quite bold, I should add.
He came to my attention.
And I shot some four frames of him, I think.
He took the picture of him thinking he was a snitch.
But he was not.
He was one of us.
Rodrigo visited me a lot.
I'm not exaggerating, he came by every day.
He was very young back then.
Maybe 14, or 15 years old.
When he decided it was time for him to start as a photographer I told him not to do it.
L don't know why I said that.
L mean, after all it was 1986, and many things had happened.
We had left behind the roughest days, but somehow I sensed that being a photographer was not enough for him.
There was no way of guessing what was going to happen to him.
Rodrigo Rojas was back from his exile in the USA he had come to photograph his country
A month prior to his death, as a bad omen Rodrigo went down to photograph Ronald Wood's funeral.
Ronald was a student who died at a demonstration.
Just like Rodrigo.
Ronald was 19 years old.
So was Rodrigo.
We saw the barricades and plenty of black smoke.
Very black, very intense...
So we said "that's the spot"!
And headed in that direction.
Once we got there, the setting had gone crazy.
Crazy... then, suddenly, the dwellers surrounded us.
We stepped off our cars...
Foreign correspondents...
Chilean reporters, photographers...
So we were surrounded.
L just remember an old lady.
A lady that grabbed me and jerked me badly.
Yelling: "Tell the truth!
Tell me truth"!
"Those kids were burnt alive!
Those kids were burnt alive"
Once we could settle things down a little, we were driven into a small street.
And they told us how everything happened.
Two kids had been burnt, they said.
They told us some kids were carrying petrol gas for the barricades when an army pick-up trunk came by... and...
Plainly, they set them on fire.
They soaked them with that petrol gas for the barricades and set them on fire.
His horrible assassination was much too hard for everyone mostly for those of us who happened to know him.
Lt also meant a pain for me.
L felt some kind of guilt.
For having encouraged him to do so.
L don't know...
It was hard for all of us.
The intention is to march to the cemetery?
They want to impede our march to the cemetery.
We have the right to bury those whom they murder.
This is an outrageous provocation that obeys the logics of war that have been established in our country.
There's one person to blame for this:
Augusto Pinochet Ugarte!
He'll have to answer for this!
Thank you.
L think he had this great urge to vindicate himself, to also have an heroical standing.
L mean, we must not forget that it's a kid we're talking about.
So it was impossible that he would listen to us.
Or that he could believe us.
Lt's quite understandable what happened to him.
Lt's tragic, devastating...
It was very traumatic for all of us and immensely sad.
You know, there's something very odd about it.
For I'm wrong about this.
But I feel blame.
And I think that I always felt that blame.
How do I remove that blame from my conscience?
One morning, on my way to school I heard on the radio that there teachers had been snatched.
Their bodies were found with their throats slit by a road near the city.
One of them was José Manuel Parada.
This is...
It's very hard.
He was friend of mine, I mean...
I visited Roberto's place, you see?
He and María were my friends.
Then this happens to José Manuel...
I mean, he was a person I had seen the previous week.
At his father's.
We had tea, we talked about a million things.
An then he gets murdered that way.
So then...
Well, you can't...
I attended his funeral, to be with them.
But couldn't stop being a photographer.
L had my camera with me.
And, suddenly, with this vision I told you about of looking where the expression of what's going on is of choosing that moment that will tell the story of what had happened.
L was destroyed by the events.
By their pain, by what had happened to José Manuel.
As I approached his coffin to say good-bye.
L then turn around and see them singing "The International"...
I raised my camera and took that picture.
Luis Navarro had to take a photo of Pinochet going into Palacio de la Moneda.
Right then he was arrested.
And remained missing for five days.
Lt was right here.
Right here it was.
L had time for some four or five shots.
Then I felt I was being pulled.
And...
That's when they arrested me.
Once they seized me, they arrested me they clearly told me:
"Now we're goanna collect for all you have done"
"Your camera damaged us much more than a gun"
"So if we blame you for the death of Holy Mary all the rest is goanna believe it"
That's what they told me.
L remember it clearly.
And they acted consequently.
By then I was somehow admired because of my work at La Vicaría.
And ended being a pariah.
They said I was an informer.
A traitor, a collaborator...
For years.
Not than I had some time informed, but for years.
That I worked at La Vicaría to give away information.
Now it's hard to live with that.
Mostly when you know you didn't do it.
The years have gone by.
L think everyone realizes now that they were wrong.
At least the people that matters to me
I had the luck that those photographers who created AFI would shelter me.
They helped me out and comforted me.
They are very, but very valuable people.
They remain being my dearest friends.
M y father...
He's my old man.
My wrinkles take after him.
When was that picture taken?
Once they released me from prison.
He demanded me to tell him.
L didn't want to.
Once I told him, this was his expression.
Lt's the picture of that moment.
L always believed more in life than in death.
In fact, that's why I have a small son.
L think that's somehow a symbol, because in spite of everything else, life finds a way.
When I try to remember my childhood days many times there's a blank.
When that happens I look at the pictures once more.
Things do appear again, I recapture those landscapes aromas moments.
Once again I find the city my father photographed.
Those humble homes.
M y house.
An old man who used to be a communist sits down to smoke all afternoon
while a gentle rain falls outside
In a naked voice the old man wonders
Why is it that by his window grey doves coincide with the grief he smokes away?
Grey doves with the grief he smokes away?
He focuses his eyes on a far distant day when a book, a kiss, a girl, a thought when a book, a kiss, a girl, a thought...
He thinks nothing can surprise him anymore
That he frightened fear away and wore out tears frightened fear away and wore out tears
He remembered the songs he used to sing ...and conversations till sunrise with his friends
And conversations till sunrise with his friends
He remembered the corner were his house was when he bid farewell to his crying mother
When he bid farewell to his crying mother ...and to his surprise there's still pain left
Now it's also raining in his eyes...
The years life his love...
The years life his love...
Still hurts
It's alive!
Stop it!
Mine doesn't work!
Stop!
St...!
Sir, mine doesn't work!

Sometimes, nature's miracles... can be found in the most amazing places.
The Penguin will rise each morning... to greet the sun with renewed vigor.
After fortifying himself for his morning ritual... he will spread his plumage... and release yesterday's catch to begin the day anew.
Renewed, the Penguin will leave his nest in search of sustenance.
He will make this walk each day... a route burned into his very soul.
He searches for the only nourishment he's ever known.
The trek is seven blocks each way... but when the ice thaws in summer, it feels like only two.
Soon, he will feel a stirring in his loins.
The Penguin must seek out a female... and it is in that search that nature will reveal its greatest miracles.
His tenacity has paid off.
The female has heard his call and has arrived to lie with him.
The Penguin has chosen an older, heavier female... as he often does, to guarantee a mating.
The Penguin mating ritual can last for up to two hours... for two minutes.
Spent, the proud Penguin falls asleep.
Sleep rarely brings peace to the Penguin.
Callings more important than slumber make their demands.
The Penguin will stand... keeping his newborn surprise warm between his legs for hours.
It's not yet ready for life on its own.
Something smells like shit!

- Yeah?
I mean...
I thought it was pronounced Acro-year.
You're both wrong!
It's actually...
Sons of bitches!
Did you really think you were any match for?
I'll just use my time chamber to go forward in time.
I'll be the first one to the top.
See you in the future, assholes.
Who's been using my time chamber as a port-a-john?
Sorry, dude.
Any port in a storm.
Why, you!
I did it!
I did it, I'm the king of the world!
King of the world!

Mission accomplished, gentlemen.
The system works.
Friday, April 25, 1986
A beautiful spring day for the 43,000 inhabitants of Pripyat, in the Ukraine.
A day that will remain forever engraved in their memory.
3 kilometers from the city - the Vladimir Ilyitch Lenin nuclear power plant where several thousand people go to work each day.
Tonight, the 176 employees of block 4 have been ordered to carry out a test on a self-fueling system of the reactor.
Something that could save energy.
At 1:23 a.m., the security systems are deactivated and the experiment begins.
A series of detonations go off in the core of the reactor.
While Pripyat sleeps peacefully, the floor of the plant begins to tremble.
The 1200 ton cover of the reactor suddenly blasts into the air.
An ultra-powerful stream of radioactive vapor releases uranium and graphite over hundreds of meters around the plant.
From the gaping hole, a spray of fire charged with radioactive particles in fusion shoots a thousand meters into the sky.
There were a lot of colors and they were really bright: orange, red, sky blue.
Colors like blood...
A rainbow...
It was beautiful...
The most serious nuclear accident in history has just taken place.
During the night, early in the morning, I got the call around 5 AM.
I was told there'd been some accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
The first firemen on the scene battle the fire without the adequate protective gear.
They pour tons of water ON this strange fire.
But nothing seems capable of putting out.
They are all exposed to lethal doses of radiation.
Two men die that night, 28 more will follow in the next few months.
They are the first victims of Chernobyl.
Nobody was prepared for such a crisis.
For the next seven months, 500,000 men wage hand to hand combat with an invisible enemy.
A ruthless battle that has gone unsung which claims thousands of unnamed and now almost forgotten heroes.
Yet, it is thanks to these men that the worst was avoided: a second explosion, ten times more powerful than Hiroshima, which would have wiped out half of Europe.
This was kept secret for twenty years by Soviets and the West alike.
Many of these images have never been seen before.
They were taken by journalists who were also exposed to nuclear contamination, some whom later died.
Those images tell the story of a hidden war whose consequences continue twenty years later to worsen the toll of the disaster.
This is the true story of the Battle of Chernobyl.
By early morning the clouds are already being contaminated by the radioactive column rising one thousand meters into the sky.
Igor Kostine is a photographer with the news agency Novosti.
When a friend and helicopter pilot phones him that morning to offer to fly him over Chernobyl, all Kostine knows is that something has happened at the plant during the night.
He is the first journalist to witness the gaping hole.
When we got close to block 4 and circled round it, I had no idea of the risk.
When we flew over the block, I opened the window of the helicopter.
I didn't realize then what a big mistake that was.
The thin translucent smoke he sees rising from the ruins is in fact highly radioactive.
Kostine is one of the few Chernobyl reporters on the scene in the early hours of the accident, to had survived serious explosion to radiation.
When I opened the window, I couldn't hear a thing.
The ruins of the reactor were below me.
I felt like I was floating in the space.
Like in a tomb.
A real dead silence.
I couldn't even hear the helicopter anymore.
Nothing.
A black hole.
A tomb and deathly silence.
This is the first picture ever taken of the breach.
All my equipment jammed after a minute.
I couldn't understand what was going on.
I thought my batteries were dead.
I only managed to take a dozen photos.
Once I returned to Kiev, I processed my pictures and I noticed the negatives were black and the colors very poor.
I didn't know it yet, but the photos had been exposed to radioactivity.
At the core of the blown-out reactor, and buried under 14 meters of rubble the graphite surrounding the nuclear fuel burns and melts the uranium.
The radioactive fallout is going be 100 times greater than the combined power of the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
At the Kremlin, eight hours after the explosion Gorbachev only has scant information on the situation.
The first information consisted of "accident" and "fire".
Not a word about an explosion.
At first, I was told there hadn't been an explosion.
The consequences of such false information were particularly dramatic.
Pripyat's 43,000 inhabitants life goes on as usual.
They know nothing about the disaster 3 kilometers away.
The information we got was that everything was sound, including the reactor.
When I asked the academician Alexandrov, he told me the reactor was absolutely safe.
It could even be set up on Red Square.
It wouldn't be any different than a samovar.
Like putting cattle on Red Square.
There are rumors in the town of a fire at the plant and deaths in the night but no official information has been released.
The white flashes on these images are the results of radioactivity on the film.
People in the streets hardly blink an eye at the masked soldiers scattered throughout the city.
Colonel Grebeniouk lead the troops in charge of controlling the situation.
There was a metallic taste in our mouths, an acidity.
They say radiation has no taste.
It was only later we realized it was the taste of radioactive iodine.
While children are still out playing in the squares Colonel Grebeniouk's men spend the day taking the first readings of radioactivity in the city.
In those days, radioactivity was measured in units called roentgens.
Normal atmospheric level is about 12 millionths of a roentgen.
In Pripyat, by early afternoon, readings are already over 200 thousandths of a roentgen.
In other words, fifteen thousand times higher than usual...
By the evening, the level has shot up to 600,000 times above normal.
Boulevard Lenin: 200, Boulevard Ukalna: 250 milliroentgens.
And that night, 7 roentgens.
My subordinates were starting to wonder: if the machines were working properly, or someone was lying to us?
We did not know that the reactor was still burning and radiation was still spreading.
This map is sealed in plastic because it's still radioactive...
It's thought that a human being can absorb up to 2 roentgens per year without being affected.
But, the body is lethally contaminated if it receives over 400 roentgens.
During that first day, the inhabitants absorb over fifty times what is considered to be a harmless dose.
At such a pace, they would have reached lethal dosage in four days.
To understand what is going on, the colonel sends a patrol to take the first readings at the base of the plant.
Their first readings were recorded on this map: 2080 roentgens!
I was worried about my subordinates.
How could I send them in there?
At these astronomical levels 15 minutes is all takes for a human being to absorb a lethal dose of radiation.
At the nuclear institute, the figures provoke a shock.
Such a level of radioactivity has never been seen before.
Gorbatchev hurriedly creates a governmental commission made up of the country's top experts in nuclear energy.
This is led by the academician Legassov, a nuclear physicist of international renown.
He immediately leaves for Chernobyl at the head of a scientific delegation.
We hoped they would be able to evaluate the situation quickly, but for the first couple days, they weren't able to tell us anything.
It was a dramatic situation.
We'd be in session, waiting for information, we were demanding information, but they weren't able to tell us anything.
Twenty hours after the explosion the level of radioactivity continues to climb.
By now, windows and doors should be sealed and iodine tablets swallowed to counteract the effects of radioactivity.
Yet no such orders have been given.
Despite rising tensions in the city the population has still not been informed of the situation.
Yulia Martchenko was only five at the time.
She lived in Pripyat with her family.
Her father worked at the plant.
My parents took me to the day care center like usual.
Everything was absolutely normal.
My father already knew there'd been an accident, but no precautions had been taken yet.
30 hours after the explosion, the first security measures are enforced.
More than 1000 buses have arrived.
At 2:00 pm the army announces the city to be completely evacuated.
I remember the teachers at the kindergarten gave us iodine pills.
Then parents came to pick up their kids.
Everyone was running around, but they weren't panicking.
We thought we were only going to be gone for three days.
To avoid any panic the authorities concealed the seriousness of the situation.
Inhabitants are given two hours to gather their belongings and assemble in front of their buildings.
They told us to get in the buses.
I remember perfectly well having to choose which toys I was going to take.
I had a lot of dolls and wanted to bring them all, but I couldn't.
We couldn't even take any warm clothes.
People have to leave everything they own, their entire lives, behind.
They will never return...
One old man didn't want to go.
He stayed behind.
They found his body a few weeks later.
People didn't really believe what was happening.
They thought they were being lied to.
They remembered the German occupation and said that in 1941, there were bombs that fell.
But now there was nothing.
The elderly people didn't believe in an invisible enemy and there was no time to explain.
My soldiers and I were simply carrying out orders.
In three and a half hours, 43,000 people are evacuated tearfully but peacefully.
Buses carry Europe's first atomic refugees.
They have been exposed to doses of radiation that may alter the composition of their blood, and engender fatal cancers.
48 hours after the disaster, the only people left in the ghost town are the military personnel and members of the scientific delegation head quartered at the Pripyat hotel.
As if unaware of the danger, they eat, sleep and work right on the premises.
These were upstanding people, specialists.
I couldn't believe they would do something irresponsible or suicidal.
No, it meant they'd underestimated the situation.
Our old criteria were no good anymore.
There'd been nuclear accidents before, in our country as well as in the US, but that information had been kept secret.
There'd never been an accident of this scope.
They even thought the reactor would be back in service by May or June.
Meanwhile, clouds filled with radioactive particles are being blown North by the wind.
Between 26 and 27 in April, they drift over one thousand kilometers above Russia, then over Belorussia and the Baltics.
On the 28th, they hit Sweden where the rise of radioactivity is detected near one of their nuclear power plants.
Soon after, television news alerts the population.
Radioactive dust from Chernobyl rains down on Stockholm.
The authorities send a squadron of fighter planes to take readings in the clouds.
The level of radioactivity suggests there's been a major accident somewhere.
60 hours after the disaster, still no official word has been reported outside of the Soviet Union.
The Swedish Ministry of Energy phoned me on Monday and I was in my office in Vienna.
And she told me that they had measured very much increased radioactivity near our power plants in Forsemark in Eastern Sweden.
And they had concluded that it must have come from abroad.
Did we know anything about it was her question.
And we said that no, we did not, but we already to contact and others contacted the Poles, they had normal nuclear power plant.
But if there was anything else and it could happened that we contacted the Russians of course.
What had happened?
An explosion?
A radioactive cloud?
Serious contamination?
It was Sweden that alerted us!
3 days after the accident, while Gorbachev is still trying to gather data,
American and European spy satellites turn to the Soviet Union and discover the ruins of the Ukrainian plant.
The smoke wafting from the gaping hole shows up clearly in thermal vision.
In the evening of that Monday the 28th, we had a message from Mr Petrossian, the head of the Atomic energy commission in Russia, in which he told us about the accident.
And about the same time, the Russians released the information to the world.
Obviously over at the Politburo, we immediately decided it was essential that all facts be reported to us from then on.
So I called on the KGB.
I told them to follow everything that was happening over there, and to report the conversations the scientists were having.
I told them to report all of that information back.
To me personally.
It has taken over 48 hours to get accurate information about the disaster.
Two days during which the 43,000 inhabitants of Pripyat are exposed to contamination.
The crises continues to grow.
At the bottom of the destroyed reactor, 1200 tons of white-hot magma continue to burn at over 3000 degrees, sending liters of radioactive gas and dust into the atmosphere.
The whole of Europe is at the mercy of the winds.
On the third day of the crisis, General Antochkine and his fleet of 80 helicopters are sent from Moscow to fight the blaze and put the fire out.
When he arrives the general flies 200 meters above the blown-out reactor.
Because of the fire, the temperature at that height was between 120-180 Celsius.
Our Dosemeter (the instrument for measuring radiation) only went up to 500 roentgens.
The needle was going crazy.
It was completely off the scale.
I think there was at least 1000 roentgens at a height of 200 meters.
Even at that altitude, a half hour of exposure could be lethal.
The strong current of radioactive hot air streaming up from the reactor makes it impossible to get closer.
They will have to improvise some way of carrying out their mission.
Something needed to be done as quickly as possible.
Put out the fire and seal up the reactor to be able to get close enough to do other work.
It also needed to be closed up to stop the radioactive dust from spreading.
It was getting blown off by the wind.
We really needed to act fast.
A gigantic ballet begins.
Top pilots have been rushed back from the Afghan front to fly helicopters carrying soldiers who toss 80 kg sandbags in to the blaze with their bare hands.
They hope to smother the fire by filling the reactor with tons of sand and boric acid, which neutralizes radiation.
The first day: 110 sorties.
The next: 300.
The radiation level above the reactor is over 3,500 roentgens, almost 9 times the lethal dose.
Some of the pilots make up to 33 flights in a single day.
Each time they went, they received 5 or 6 roentgens.
If they were slow, it was even more.
After throwing 6, 7, 8 bags, they were drenched in sweat from the heat.
After a few missions, my soldiers would go wash up and eat.
After a while, they'd start throwing up.
Since the crisis began, radiation victims are being sent to Moscow's hospital number 6.
It has the country's only service which specializes in acute radiation sickness and illnesses linked to massive doses of radiation exposure.
The initial symptoms of radiation sickness: vomiting, nausea and diarrhea are followed by a latency period.
It's only later that much more fatal symptoms appear, such as deterioration of bone marrow and horrible burns that eat flesh down to the bone.
When they arrived at the clinic, it was very hard, psychologically speaking.
They came straight from the airport.
Almost all of them were young.
They arrived during the latency period.
They felt fine.
They were all dressed alike, wearing the same pajamas.
They were making jokes.
But we already knew that a lot of them were going to die.
27 of them died quite quickly.
They'd all received huge doses of radiation and were suffering from life-threatening burns.
For 15 years, only the first victims will be acknowledged by the authorities.
Thirty kilometers east of the plant, the forest has been scorched by the radioactive blast from the explosion.
But the disaster area already stretches well beyond.
Since the explosion, radioactive particles carried by the clouds have been falling with the rain.
A "leopard-spot" pattern of contamination has affected the Ukraine as well as Belorussia and Russia.
On the first of May, the wind shifts, and areas of Kiev are also contaminated, as seen from this map drawn up from the readings taken by Colonel Grebeniouk's men.
The seriously contaminated areas appear in red, surrounded by areas where the radiation level was normal.
But the population is still kept in the dark.
There is only one report, a tiny article on the bottom of page three of the Pravda, playing down the accident and claiming the danger has passed.
The roof was caving in, and there we were acting as if nothing was happening.
By going ahead with the May Day festivities, it was like the country refused to acknowledge the situation.
That was the second phase in the huge Chernobyl disaster.
Six days after the accident, despite radiation levels several thousand times higher than normal, authorities encourage people to participate in May Day celebrations, even in areas they know to be seriously contaminated.
I watched the May Day in 1986 festivities with my own eyes.
I was there and I witnessed it, the parade of death.
It was a parade of death.
Those were terrible deaths.
Disturbingly, all footage of May Day 1986 has now disappeared from the Ukrainian national archives.
All that remains are Igor Kostine's photos.
Cherbitsky, the first secretary of the Ukraine, also went to the festivities with his family and his grandchildren.
It's true that, in theory, that seemed very important to us, to avoid any panic.
But had we known how much radioactivity was already in the air...
How many were contaminated during the festivities?
Not a single study has yet been published.
Cherbinsky, first Secretary of the Ukraine Communist Party, Later committed suicide...
One week after the explosion, the exodus continues.
The inhabitants of the city of Chernobyl, seven kilometers from the plant, are evacuated.
So all the villages within a thirty-kilometer radius around the plant.
130,000 people are moved, many of whom have already been dangerously contaminated.
A 300,000-hectare area straddling the Ukraine and Belorussia is abruptly evacuated and isolated from the rest of the world.
A vast region uprooted, an entire culture ripped from its land, a world wiped out in a few days' time by an invisible enemy.
It was worse than a war.
Here, you couldn't see the enemy.
In a war, you see the cannons, the machine guns, the tanks.
Here, you see nothing.
The radiation is everywhere.
It goes right through you.
It gets into you and you only start feeling the effects later.
Sometimes years later.
It's terrifying...
Meanwhile, the radioactive cloud continues to drift over Europe.
It floats over Bavaria and Northern Italy.
Radioactive Cesium 137 and Iodine 131 rain down on the south of France and Corsica.
Crops and pastures are seriously contaminated.
While French authorities deny its presence, the cloud reaches Great Britain and spreads into Greece.
In Chernobyl the level of radioactivity continues to climb.
6000 tons of sand and boric acid have filled the hole.
But underneath this gigantic plug, the white-hot magma continues to smolder.
10 days after the disaster, Gorbatchev personally invites Hans Blix, director of the powerful International Atomic Energy Agency, to visit the site.
He is the first expert - and the first Westerner - to visit Chernobyl.
Well, we have seen the sight from the air, and we have seen that a little smoke is still coming up from the damaged plant.
There was a good deal of talk about the risk of a second explosion.
I remember that, when we were in Moscow, actually we had a friend, a relative of one of my experts, phoned in and said that you know we have rumor that second reactor might also explode.
At the bottom of the reactor, 195 tons of nuclear fuel is still burning, giving off incredible heat that is gradually melting the sand.
On the surface of the plug, cracks begin to appear.
Once we plugged up the hole, the temperature started to rise.
We were afraid because it could have caused another explosion.
It was terrifying.
Scientists came to take readings.
They were very worried.
They were afraid the critical temperature would be reached and it would set off a second explosion.
That would have been a terrible tragedy.
The cement slab below the reactor core is heating up and in danger of cracking.
The magma is threatening to seep through.
The water the firemen poured during the first hours of the disaster has pooled below the slab.
If the radioactive magma makes contact with the water, it could set off a second explosion even more devastating than the first.
The country's top experts are called into action.
Vassili Nesterenko was one of them.
At the time, he was working on improving the Soviet Union's intercontinental nuclear missiles.
If the heat managed to crack the cement slab, only 1400 kg of the uranium and graphite mixture
would have needed to hit the water to set off a new explosion.
The ensuing chain reaction could set off an explosion comparable to a gigantic atomic bomb.
Our experts studied the possibility and concluded that the explosion would have had a force of 3 to 5 megatons.
Minsk, which is 320 km from Chernobyl, would have been razed, and Europe rendered uninhabitable.
We had to stop the process.
If it continued, it would have been an enormous disaster.
An enormous nuclear disaster...
This second explosion would have been accompanied by a terrible shock wave and a massive rise in radioactivity that would have claimed thousands of lives in a matter of hours.
Thank God it didn't happen!
There were trains with over a thousand cars in Minsk, Gomel and Kiev, ready to evacuate the population.
The situation is critical.
In Moscow, the state commission decrees two emergency measures.
First: send in a battalion of firemen to drain the water from under the reactor.
They will later be declared national heroes, but will suffer from radiation sickness the rest of their lives.
Second: seal the breach more effectively to bring the temperature down once and for all.
In two days, General Antochkin's men will drop 2400 tons of lead into the reactor.
When we started dumping lead in, the temperature went down right away.
It absorbed well and sealed the hole as it melted, so there was less radiation.
But some of this lead melts when it hits the blaze and vaporizes into the atmosphere.
Twenty years later, traces of it can be found in the sick children of Chernobyl.
It's highly criticized today, but given the situation, there was no better solution.
And all the people - military or civilians, officers or not - worked selflessly.
I participated in this first stage, and I can tell you, it had to be done.
It was heroism.
During this operation, 600 pilots are fatally contaminated with radiation.
All of them will die.
But their efforts only buy a few days.
Although it has been covered over, the fire still isn't out.
Flying over in helicopters isn't solving the problem.
They needed to get closer, go down into the breach.
But how?
With the imminent threat of a second explosion still looming, the makeshift measures continue.
The blueprints of the plant reveal that the "active zone" can be approached through the cable and pipe tunnels built out of thick cement.
A delegation of technicians from the Kurtchatov Institute venture into the labyrinth.
It is tough going.
Parts of the tunnels have collapsed in the explosion.
They pierce through the shell of the 4th reactor with a blow-torch, and stick their radioactivity detectors and thermometers in, along with cameras.
The result is terrifying.
The radiation levels are astronomical, and their worst fears are confirmed.
The white-hot magma has cracked the cement slab and seeped into the empty basin.
It is now threatening to sink even further.
There was a five to ten percent risk of explosion.
We'd drained the water from under the reactor, but something absolutely had to be done, something had to be put underneath the reactor to keep the magma from seeping down, something had to keep it from falling in.
Nothing is stopping the magma from seeping even deeper into the sandy subsoil.
And beneath the reactor lays a huge stretch aquifer that supplies the entire country with water.
What worried us the most was that the entire mass would sink down and reach the ground water, which then would pollute the rivers Pripyat, then Dniepre, Kiev...
The Black Sea...
We absolutely needed to come up with a solution!
A new operation is considered.
But it will entail the loss of more lives.
On the 12th oh May, 1986, 17 days after the initial explosion, the miners of Toula, one thousand kilometers from Chernobyl, receive a visit from the Kremlin from the deputy Minister of the Mining Industry.
The minister spoke to us about the accident at Chernobyl.
He said they needed miners from our region, the Moscow basin.
He gave us 24 hours to gather our belongings.
The next day, we were bused from that very square to the airport in Moscow.
On May 13, our comrades were already at work in Chernobyl.
Their mission: to approach the reactor through what is now the only possible path - underground.
Our mission was this: dig a 150-meter tunnel from the 3rd block to the 4th, a tunnel 30 meters long.
Then dig a room 30 meters long and 30 meters wide to hold a refrigeration device for cooling down the reactor.
To limit their exposure to radiation, the miners dig 12 meters down before making their way over to the burning reactor.
There, they build a room 2 meters high and 30 meters wide where a complex cooling system of liquid nitrogen will be set up.
In one month, 10,000 miners from Russia and the mining regions of the Ukraine are sent down into the tunnel.
They are between 20 to 30 years old.
Inside the tunnel, which has no ventilation, the temperature hits 50C, and radioactivity is at a minimum of 1 roentgen per hour.
We worked without any protective gear.
The miners couldn't used masks, because the filters would get damp after a few minutes.
So everyone just took them off and kept on working without them, with our shirts off too.
We drank water out of open bottles, which was really bad because the radioactive particles were ingested right into our body.
One of our comrades swallowed a grain of sand that was highly radioactive.
He died.
How can we know what each of us breathed in or ingested?
The hardest thing was the lack of oxygen and the incredible heat.
It was hot, hot, hot... and we had to work really fast.
At a crazy pace.
Faster and faster...
That was the hardest.
Go, go, go...
Battalions of 30 miners relay each other every three hours, 24 hours a day.
In one month and four days, they dig a 150-meter tunnel a job that in a mine would have normally taken three months.
The most dangerous places were not underground.
There wasn't as much radiation below the reactor.
But as soon as we came up, we had to run even faster.
Radioactivity at the mouth of the tunnel is three hundred times higher.
Not a single miner is spared from exposure.
Not once are they informed of the real dangers they are facing.
Someone had to go and do it.
Us or someone else...
We did our duty.
Should we have done it?
it's too late to judge.
I don't regret anything.
The miners accomplish their mission, but the cooling system is never set up below the reactor.
The underground room is finally filled with cement to solidify the structure.
The official position is that each miner received 30 to 60 roentgens, but survivors claim they received up to 5 times that amount.
It is estimated that a fourth of these men died before the age of 40.
2,500 lives lost that don't appear in any official statistic.
While the miners are still digging below the reactor, Hans Blix with Soviet authorities organizes a press conference in Moscow.
Let me say that on behalf of the IAEA, we have expressed profound regret at the tragic accident.
The loss of lives and the damage which has been caused.
We have now agreed with the Soviet authorities to come to Vienna for a post-accident analysis...
In front of 500 journalists from all over the world, he announces an international conference that will be held in Vienna, where the Soviets have agreed to share all their data on the disaster.
The most important effect of the press conference was that the Russian people felt that we can believe these guys.
They were used to having a government that they did not believe one word in, and accidents and disasters were usually suppressed.
They didn't inform about them, so what they heard about this just kept them worried, that it may be even worse.
I was it was bad enough to be sure, but they felt that these guys we trust, so this was a victory for Glasnost.
The Soviets agree to cooperate fully with the West.
A historic change that begins an era of openness, which became known as Glasnost.
A political victory for Gorbatchev, who sorely needs it.
Because in Chernobyl, although the fire is now being kept in check, the breach and tons of highly radioactive rubble lie exposed to the elements.
It is of the utmost urgency to cover the broken structure and clean up the zone.
But for that, more men will be needed - many more men.
18 days after the disaster, Gorbatchev finally addresses the Soviet people.
The entire country was mobilized.
No bureaucratic formalities.
If someone had what we needed, we took it.
No formalities.
We'd worry about the cost later.
We took whatever we needed, it was a front-line situation.
General Nikolai Tarakanov is sent to command the land troops.
In one year, a hundred thousand soldiers and officers passed through Chernobyl.
They were all reservists.
They were summoned up by top administration in their cities and sent to the front.
Military personnel or civilians, officers or simple soldiers, all of them are "liquidators", a term invented for the Battle of Chernobyl.
Their mission: clean up - liquidate - the radioactivity.
Igor Kostine was one of five war reporters authorized by the Kremlin to cover the battle.
A first in a country that kept everything hidden.
Three of his colleagues are now dead.
There were no titles.
No ministers, generals or soldiers.
No one was saying, "I'm a general, do what I say..." Everyone was honestly doing what they could.
And so they were be name "the liquidation of the Chernobyl accident" was set in motion.
100,000 troops as well as 400,000 civilians, workers, engineers, nurses, doctors and scientists from every Soviet republic pass through Chernobyl.
The Soviet Union is waging its last major battle.
Five hundred thousand people.
The troops in Chernobyl were bigger than Napoleon's.
But our army got contaminated.
From the sky, helicopters drop tons of a sticky liquid dubbed "burba": a mixture that coagulates and plasters the radioactive dust to the ground.
Meanwhile, brigades of liquidators are put in charge of cleaning up the zone and, house by house, of removing the layer of radioactive dust that covers everything.
Special hunting squads were formed.
They patrolled the countryside and forests with rifles, killing cats and dogs.
All the animals have to be killed, because when they wandered through highly contaminated zones, their fur soaked up the radioactivity.
They could contaminate the liquidators.
"A man is living in this house.
Do not destroy..."
The last villages with people still remaining in the zone are evacuated.
The houses are knocked down one by one and buried.
At night, the trucks and the machines, and the men, are covered in radioactive dust.
We would wash five to six times in the shower.
We helped each other.
We used a hemp glove and the roughest soap available.
We scrubbed away.
We put on new clothes, then we ate.
We ate really well there, ...because you need to keep your strength up to fight the ionizing radiation.
Ionizing radiation seeks out the weak spots in your body.
That's where it finds a way in and knocks you out.
Around the plant, a colossal operation is set in motion.
It goes on 7 days a week without a single day off.
300,000 cubic meters of contaminated earth are bulldozed into huge ditches and covered over with cement.
This spot, around the 4th reactor, is where the most dangerous missions of the zone took place.
Eight weeks after the explosion, the liquidators tackle the heart of the problem:
in order to neutralize the toxic waste for the long-term and prevent it from spreading even more, the entire blown-out reactor has to be isolated.
Lev Bolchakov was one of the engineers who designed the enormous structure that would entirely cover the fourth reactor.
A "sarcophagus" of steel and concrete 170 meters long and 66 meters high.
It was a one-of-a-kind and unique project.
No one had ever built such a structure in a zone this radioactive.
You could only work a few minutes at a time.
That had never been done before.
It is an enormous challenge:
How do you build a monumental structure in a place where humans can work for only a few minutes, or even just seconds, at a time?
This utterly new situation will require more improvisation from the liquidators, and put more lives at risk.
It has now been more than 12 weeks since the initial blast at Block number 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
To stop the deadly contamination, the final attack is launched.
Radioactivity in this sector is so high that only remote-controlled machines can be sent in.
But people will have to get the machines into position.
Workers can only stay a few minutes without receiving a fatal dose of radiation.
With each second, their lives are more and more threatened.
Here's one of the armored vehicles.
It looks primitive, but we had to build them ourselves.
We lined the cabs entirely with lead to protect our soldiers from the radiation as best we could.
Each metallic piece of the structure is prefabricated, sometimes hundreds of kilometers away, then brought one by one onto the site for assembly.
An extraordinary jigsaw puzzle:
Beams 150 tons and 70 meters long.
Buttresses 45 meters high.
That's the DEMAC 4000.
Look at the size of this crane.
We couldn't work very long on the site and there was no room for error.
The slightest miscalculation and it would have been impossible to fit it all together.
Despite the extreme conditions, work progresses.
100,000 cubic meters of cement are used to make the structure.
But the discovery of a new problem forces the work to a halt: the roof of the plant is covered in highly contaminated pieces of graphite.
These pieces of graphite enveloped uranium rods.
They've been blown from the reactor during the explosion.
One single piece gives off enough radioactivity to kill a man in less than one hour.
They absolutely have to be gotten rid of before construction continues.
Robots are sent onto the roof to shove the lethal debris over the edge.
60 meters below, other robots gather it up and burry it in ditches.
But after a few days, the ambient radioactivity begins to affect even the machines.
Their electronic circuitry can't hold up.
They go berserk and break down.
One of them hurtles itself into the breach.
On the roof, robotic machines are no longer an option.
Men will have to replace them.
Russian soldiers, nicknamed "bio-robots" for the occasion.
This battalion of young reservists is preparing to go up onto the roof of the third reactor for the first time.
They're between 20 and 30 years old, all of them reservists called to the front for the most dangerous and deadly battle of Chernobyl.
No human has ever worked in zones as radioactive as this.
General Nikolai Tarakanov is in command of the operations, and personally oversee every detail.
down to the hand-sewn lead suits that every soldier is forced to make the night before the attack.
On their front, on their back, in their boots - they were covered in lead.
A helmet, a mask to protect against beta rays and a special apron.
Double layers of protection on the hands.
The whole uniform weighed 26 to 30 kilos.
Obviously, some people didn't want to go, but they had to.
They were reservists.
They had to go.
For me, there was no question:
I had to go to my duty.
Who was going to do it for me?
Who is going to clean up this disaster and stop the spread of radioactivity all over the world?
Somebody had to do it.
Two and a half weeks of hell.
But hell only lasted 2-3 minutes for each soldier, or sometimes even just 40 seconds when the level was too high.
We were careful to calculate out the time to save as many lives as possible.
When the siren blows, a crew of 8 soldiers rushes up on the roof along with an officer.
Their mission is simple: shovel up the radioactive debris as quickly as possible and throw it off the roof.
According to General Tarakanov's calculations, the level of radioactivity estimated to be 7000 roentgens per hour only allows bio-robots 45 seconds on the roof only enough time for a couple shovelfuls.
We were like ants: just as some were finishing their task, others would immediately take their place.
Everyone did their job, no matter how small it was, and that's how, together, we were able to fight the radioactivity.
For ten days, a new crew of bio-robots climbs on the roof every ten minutes.
According to military personnel, 3,500 people participate in the clean-up.
Some, like Igor Kostine and Constantin Fedotov, went up on the roof five times.
We'd pick up pieces that were 1,500 roentgens.
After a day of work, our hands would ache and we couldn't make a fist.
The first time I went up on the roof, I was struck by the mystical feeling there.
It was like being on another planet.
The whole thing was covered in radioactive waste.
My hands were shaking.
I didn't know what world I was in, and I started snapping photos.
If you look close, you can see traces of radiation on the film.
I was holding the camera like this, and it was coming up from the ground, like that.
Your eyes hurt and there was a metal taste in your mouth, those are the two things you felt.
And once you felt that, you knew you'd gotten more than your dose.
You couldn't feel your teeth up there.
Your mouth was full of this lead taste.
You went like this, but you couldn't hear anything.
Everything was covered in lead.
Even today, twenty years later, I can still taste the lead in my mouth.
Thousands of them will discover that this peculiar taste means the invisible enemy is attacking.
As the bio-robots are sacrificing their lives on the roof of the plant, the clean-up continues throughout the 30-kilometer zone,
24 hours a day, rain or shine.
Where normally it would take one man one hour to do a job, here in Chernobyl, it took sixty people.
When we came down off the roof, it felt like our blood had been sucked dry by vampires; we were drained, we couldn't move.
Some people would have nosebleeds.
The firemen were right there.
If someone's nose started bleeding, they got sent to the hospital.
If we collapsed, we got sent home, but we wanted to hold out.
But at the time, we were young and strong.
Our health is shot, we've lost everything.
They wrote in my record that we'd got 20.5 roentgens.
But what did that mean?
That number was several times lower than the actual dose.
As reward, each soldier received a liquidator certificate from the army.
and a 100-rouble bonus the equivalent today of about 100 U.S. dollars
They had risked their lives.
But they have only reduced the radiation level on the roof by 35%.
When they sent all those people up onto the roof, no one knew exactly the actual level of radiation.
Now we know it was between 10,000 and 12,000 roentgens per hour.
At that level of radioactivity, people never should have been sent!
Seven months after the explosion, the zone has been cleaned up and the sarcophagus completed.
500,000 people, military and civilians, have participated in the operation.
I told the commission that, for having confronted such levels of radioactivity,
having cleaned up all that graphite, and having accomplished such heroic tasks, our soldiers needed something symbolic like putting up our flag.
Putting the flag up was like putting the flag on the Reichstag when the Red Army conquered fascism.
For them, the flag was a symbol of their triumph over radioactivity.
Each team of liquidators celebrates the end of the operation in their own way.
Bocharov and his men etch their names onto the final metal piece to go up on top of the sarcophagus.
Our sarcophagus is a Pantheon.
A tomb...
A mausoleum...
Our second mausoleum!
After that, we stopped building nuclear power plants.
A bitter victory.
The country will never recover.
It cost us 18 billion rubles.
At that time, a ruble was worth one dollar.
18 billion!
That's huge!
And if you consider that, shortly after, the price of oil collapsed, you can imagine the trouble our country and perestroika were up against.
The first snow has started to stick on Chernobyl.
For authorities, this proves the sarcophagus is airtight.
At least for 30 years, or so they predict.
The liquidators have gone home.
Reactors 1, 2 and 3 are back up and running.
The first battle of Chernobyl has ended in a victory that heralded the end of the USSR.
But for many, it also marks the beginning of a war that, 20 years later, still hasn't ended.
Twenty years later, Pripyat is still a ghost town.
Accompanied by Igor Kostine, Yulia wanted to see the apartment where she lived with her family up until the fateful day of their evacuation.
Contrary to what they'd been told not a single inhabitant was ever able to come back to live in the deserted buildings.
For Igor Kostine as well, the visit stirs up painful memories.
He was fatally exposed to radiation during the seven months he spent covering the battle.
Since then, he's had to be hospitalized for over two months each year.
For the hundreds of thousands of atomic refugees, as for the hundreds of thousands of veterans from the Battle of Chernobyl the fight against the invisible enemy hasn't let up.
Everyone who went to Chernobyl is still suffering from the radioactivity their bodies absorbed.
In the months following the accident the liquidators flooded into hospitals all over the Soviet Union.
Twenty years later, those who are still alive continue to frequent hospital number 6.
They're all victims of what specialists have since named "The Chernobyl Syndrome."
We've all got a bunch of symptoms: heart, stomach, liver, kidneys, nervous system.
Our whole bodies were radically upset by the metabolic changes caused by radiation, and chemical exposure.
When the liquidators went back home, they were exhausted, incapable of going back to a normal life.
Twenty years later, many of those who survived are disabled and unable to work.
And the authorities appear to be ignoring their plight by cutting down their welfare money.
The veterans of the war in Afghanistan are still alive, while we are slowly wasting away.
I have written a poem about this:
"Sadness fills me, nostalgia and anguish,
Like a bullet in the temple,
Nothing can ever stop.
The mother prays in secret to God,
To spare his life... "
These men weren't even thirty when they were sent in to battle the atom.
Today, the survivors are not yet 50 years old, but they struggle like senior citizens.
According to the military, of the 500,000 Chernobyl liquidators 20,000 have already died.
200,000 are officially disabled.
You don't know how long you have to live, or what disease is going to kill you.
You don't know what effects it will have on your children, if you have any.
We know all that, and we know the invisible enemy is eating away inside of us like a worm.
For us, the war continues, and little by little we're slipping away from this world.
Yet for two decades, only 59 deaths had been officially attributed to the Chernobyl disaster.
Not a single study has been carried out on the 130,000 refugees from the zone.
Not a single statistic on the state of the 500,000 liquidators.
No figures on the population that continues to live around Chernobyl and in the contaminated areas.
The real amount of radiation these people were exposed to has never been revealed to them.
A deputy of the Supreme Soviet discovered the systematic cover-up of the true consequences of Chernobyl when the Soviet Empire dissolved in 1991.
Taking advantage of the anarchy in the country she managed to get her hands on a copy of top secret documents.
600 pages of a report to the Central Committee written while the Battle of Chernobyl was still raging.
When I read these documents, I discovered everything happened differently.
I realized just how huge a lie the Party leaders told.
Decree No.12 stated that on May 12, 1986, 10,198 people had already been hospitalized, 345 showed signs of radio-lesions.
Yet at the same time, they were telling us everything was fine, that it was nothing serious, and I realized the scope of the lies.
According to Alla, another passage reveals that authorities had arbitrarily changed the standards.
Multiplying by five what was considered the acceptable dose of radiation for the human body.
When they raised the standard, suddenly people were miraculously cured.
They were released from the hospital and sent home.
It was criminal.
The tendency to manipulate the numbers was not unique to the Soviets.
In late August 1986 the first international conference assessing Chernobyl took place behind closed doors.
It was presided over by Hans Blix, No journalists or outside observers were admitted into the amphitheater.
The Russian delegation was led by Legassov the man who'd been in charge of the governmental commission during the Battle of Chernobyl.
When we put him in charge of preparing the report for the IAEA, we gave him the duty of reporting everything.
He came up with a very detailed report that put everybody in a state of shock.
Legassov spoke for three hours.
His report concluded that in the decades to come, about 40,000 deaths from cancer caused by Chernobyl were to be expected.
The Western world refused flat out to accept this estimate which spurred a genuine East-West negotiation.
These are theoretical calculations based upon the Hiroshima model.
That you say that if you have certain radio-activity, you know from Hiroshima, that the long term effect, that so or so many would die from it.
And if you then increase it by tenfold, you assumed that it will be tenfold.
That's the calculation.
This is not I think an exact, it is not empiric...
There again, the figures were surprisingly flexible.
By the end of the conference, people were no longer talking about 40,000 but rather 4000 probable deaths.
Nearly twenty years later in September 2005, this figure became the official death toll of the disaster.
The staunchest opponents to the Soviets' policy of transparency were the French, who went as far as to deny that the radioactive cloud passed over their country.
Twenty years later in France and especially in Corsica, cases of thyroid cancer of the same nature and severity as those around Chernobyl are being reported.
The most dangerous element that came out of the Chernobyl reactor wasn't cesium or plutonium, but lies.
"The Lie of '86", that's what I call it.
A lie that was propagated like the radioactivity - throughout the whole country and the entire world.
On the 27th of April, 1988 the second anniversary of the disaster,
Legassov who'd worked so hard to unveil the entire truth decided to put an end to his life.
Today, as perfect metaphors of the institutionalized lie the radioactive particles hurled from the reactor in the explosion continue to poison the land.
Twenty years after the disaster, the area of Chernobyl remains uninhabitable.
In five years, the radionuclides sink five centimeters into the contaminated soil.
So twenty years later, they're 20 cm under the ground.
They continue to contaminate all the plants.
To clean it up, we'd need to remove 20 cm of soil and seal it underground in burial sites.
And that's too big of a job to do.
It's impossible ...
Today, eight million people live in contaminated areas of Ukraine, Russia and especially Belorussia.
For twenty years, they've lived off the radioactive food that continues to contaminate them little by little.
This issue, raised in 1986 by the Soviet delegation at the Vienna conference, has been systematically ignored.
And yet, 1,152 children were treated for thyroid cancer between 1986 and 2002 at the specialized center in Minsk.
How many in other cities?
No global statistics have yet been made public.
One doctor, Youri Bandajevski has been studying illnesses among the populations in the contaminated areas ever since the disaster.
When his findings were published in 1996, they were immediately condemned.
Arrested and officially sentenced for "corruption", he spent the next five years in jail.
In November 2005, he was still under house arrest.
Look what happened when the mother was contaminated with cesium during pregnancy.
In one single family, look how many deformations: hare-lips, missing eyes, deformed skulls.
These embryos come from hamsters that were fed only contaminated grass from the region of Gomel.
The result: entire litters of deformed animals.
I was horrified by how many deformed embryos developed in animals that had eaten cesium-contaminated food.
I obtained a horrible number of deformations in two weeks.
Usually, when you encounter a "monster", you describe it.
You're certainly familiar with Peter the Great's Kunstkamera museum in Saint-Petersburg.
Quite frankly, I myself could create as many "monsters" as I wanted.
There's been no official study of genetic mutations stemming from Chernobyl.
Yet despite the thousands of miscarriages and abortions that took place following the disaster, there seem to be hundred of children who suffered the effect of radiation.
The deformations we see among these children are similar to those of Bandajevski's hamsters.
In Belorussia, 300,000 children are currently suffering the consequences of contamination.
NGOs, like the International Green Cross founded by Gorbatchev after he was sidelined from the government in 1991, have opened treatment and support centers for victims of Chernobyl.
They also organize therapeutic camps aiming to teach the new generations in contaminated areas how to live with radioactivity like here, testing the contamination of their food.
How many years is this going to go on?
800 years?
800 years.
Until the second Jesus Christ is born?
Until his return?
Yes, Chernobyl played an important role for us all.
And of course, we must keep searching and not skimp on means.
We must strengthen international cooperation, and create international scientific centers to find new sources of energy which are safer.
That's the essential issue...
I wouldn't wish for anyone, not my friends or my enemies, to experience such a tragedy.
No one deserves to live through what we did in Chernobyl.
We're all human beings and no one deserves that.
In the heart of the zone, ten kilometers from the nuclear power plant and hidden in the forest, lies Chernobyl 2.
Twenty years ago no one could get near this huge military radar:
Moscow's hidden eye meant to spot American missiles.
The fact it was put out of service after the explosion tallies with what the Chernobyl accident seemed to foreshadow.
Using weapons is a terrible thing, and nuclear weapons are even worse.
Chernobyl was an accident involving one single reactor - a limited accident - whose consequences are still with us.
We've had two bombs:
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
There again, the consequences are still being felt today.
Chernobyl showed us the true nature of nuclear energy in human hands.
We'd calculated that our most powerful missile, the SS-18, was as powerful as 100 Chernobyls.
The SS-18 was the warhead the Americans feared the most, and we had 2,700 of them.
And these were the missiles we'd intended for the Americans.
2,700!
Imagine the destruction...
Mister Gorbatchev was probably right in saying that Chernobyl was a big illustration of radioactivity let loose.
And in this sense, suggested to people more vividly that we ought to do away with nuclear weapons.
A year and half after Chernobyl, Gorbatchev retired all nuclear warheads with a range of 500 to 5000 km.
Ten years later the Total Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was ratified by the entire world, with the exception of India.
Chernobyl marked the beginning of disarmament for the world's greatest nuclear rivals.
Chernobyl convinced everyone.
Soviets and Americans alike realized once and for all the magnitude of the atomic volcanoes our countries were sitting upon.
Not just our two countries, but the entire world.
The entire world!
Yet twenty years later the Chernobyl disaster and its lessons seem to be fading from memory.
Meanwhile, beneath the aging sarcophagus of reactor number 4 the poison remains deadly.
Since 2001 the three Chernobyl reactors have been shut down once and for all.
But twenty years after the explosion a dosimeter flies off the chart at the base of the sarcophagus.
High levels of radioactivity, a hundred times above normal, are still contaminating the plant's surroundings.
The structure has been weakened by rain and erosion.
Since its construction, 3000 liquidators have been watching over it, trying to ward off damage.
We built this sarcophagus to last 30 years, thinking that 30 years after the explosion, we could build a new sarcophagus without people having to run because of high radiation levels.
Twenty years have gone by and nothing's been done yet.
And it's urgent that it get replaced.
But the Ukraine doesn't have anymore money.
Neither do we.
A new sarcophagus is underway.
But its construction is already ten years behind schedule.
A structure 108 meters high meant to entirely cover the first sarcophagus.
It will cost: one billion dollars.
An international fund led by Hans Blix has been set up.
We still have not put the new sarcophagus on it that will be ready in a couple of years' time.
When that is done, allow they can do later on to remove the masses of spent fuel, the melted fuel which is still there...
Twenty years after the explosion, the cooled magma at the reactor's core 14 meters underground is still a terrible threat.
And will remain so for years to come.
I pray God the sarcophagus never collapses.
That would be the worst thing that could happen.
Because inside, there are 100 kg of plutonium.
One microgram is the lethal dose for a human being.
That means there's enough plutonium to poison a hundred million people.
The half-life of plutonium, in other words the time it takes for half of the plutonium to disappear, is 245,000 years.
It's something we could thus consider eternal.
There are areas where there will never be life again...
Despite this terrible warning the nuclear disarmament sparked by Chernobyl is clearly coming into question today.
If nuclear development for civilian uses is being put forward as a solution to the problems of fossil fuels and global warming, this landscape reminds us that such an option is not without consequences.
It requires the greatest caution and clear information on the real risks it presents.
Chernobyl also reminds us that if we must live with radioactivity and its unavoidable dangers, we also need to spare future generations from any risk of nuclear apocalypse.

Doneko 2011 - in memory of the liquidators -
Are you all right, Colonel?
It's nothing.
Just a cold.
No big deal.
It's just annoying.
Talk about annoying.
What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space Gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney, but the MALP detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
I'm just saying that identifying potential space Gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of some backwater hamlet.
Are you that eager to return to Earth, Rodney?
This isn't just about me.
It is about the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently... and whenever I want to.
- How's that work again?
- Okay... once we've seeded enough Stargates across the void between Pegasus and the Milky Way, we'll be able to take a Jumper from one to the other to the other, till we reach the other side.
That way, we won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus, and travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs, and... get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
- We should probably go.
- Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, no, when you're right, you're right.
- No, we're here now...
Hello!
Hello, new people!
Why didn't anybody tell me the new people were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Oh, please.
Well, I was just out for a walk.
Have you met the new people yet?
We just got here.
Oh, great.
Great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife, Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives are just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello, sweetheart.
I love ya.
I love ya.
- Fair day, everybody.
- Fair day Lucius.
Fair day.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex.
Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla... and you are from...
- Athos.
- Athos...
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
It sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, we have some lunch, we talk about this...
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows... he's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then...
Lucius... we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch...
Everybody has to eat, right come one.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
Fair day.
Fair day, Lucius.
Fair day.
Fair day.
Here I come!
Season 3, Episode 3 Irresistible
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really, but... it hasn't stopped me from trying.
I see.
Is she taken yet?
No... nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
I love a woman with spirit... and a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius, please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners, but
- what is it exactly about you...
- I know what you're going to say.
So you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those... gifts?
Exploration, alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that, just...
- just like that.
- It's just a cold.
Nevertheless,
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
That's impressive.
You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So... where are you all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine of yours.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk, I look up... and I heard and somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- I mean, where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes... they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Or perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
Or perhaps not.
What, you come all this way, you don't even want to do a trade?
Look, it doesn't have to be the ship.
Forget the ship.
I don't even want the ship, okay?
You've got to have some other stuff that you want to trade, right?
Okay like... how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great,
- but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we would love to stay, we really must go.
No, no, no.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
Come on, come on.
We haven't even had the second course.
Please!
I want you to see some of my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
Another time, Lucius.
We've got to go.
No... no, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what...
soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer.
Then we'll talk about trade.
Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
- You won't be disappointed!
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
Then again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicine.
Sounds like a snake oil salesman to me, but it might be worth having Beckett check it out.
Well, I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer pretty quickly.
- So it's back out to scout for Gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet on my walks, but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess,
I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
Every single one?
Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, "thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man".
Young, old... women...
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up around the square just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say "be with you", right?
- I think so, yes.
- I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid
I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway...
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well... we found an unused Gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy Gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair anyway, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest Gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay a little longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know, what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
I was a kid myself.
I take the baby, and I open my coat, and I tuck the baby inside, and I start stroking the baby's back, gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again,
but beat it did... and a cry arose, piercing the cold night air, as if to say...
I... am... alive.
Astonishing.
And that baby... that baby... grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain damage, but just a little, but the story is true.
- And thank you for sharing it with me.
- Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most... to share.
To share me.
- And I can see that now.
- You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- may I call you Carson?
- Of course you can.
Carson, this City that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
- Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is... oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
Oh, aye, we have several.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Look, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my.
When you said this place was a ten, I thought, "okay, maybe... maybe it's an eight and a half,"
but this...
Carson?
Dr. Weir... permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning... you never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
Is this the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
Really?
That guy?
Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney.
Gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
It's just you're acting... a little...
Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
This is not something to treat lightly.
No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger to Atlantis without prior approval.
Now he knows about the City, as well as our Gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace, as our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value to us.
We'll just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out to scout more Gates.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could always have my own personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know, I'll take a look at what you have if you insist, but... this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
Oh, I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
- Lucius just give them a chance to get to know you.
- I just hope I get that chance.
Oh, you will, I promise.
In fact, I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Oh, hello.
I was going to go get something to eat, because they forgot to bring me something, so... are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about the City unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me then?
You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
- I'm sorry.
My manners just fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
Isn't she something?
Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no, no.
Come on.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit in there all alone.
Come on, please?
- Very well.
We will both take you.
Oh, both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other then, okay.
Like how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems... excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol,
- endangering...
- and for that I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
- It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
- No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my homeworld, topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
Please, have a seat.
After you.
What are you doing?
I've been told that you would like to negotiate a possible alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
I mean, that's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then... why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us.
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet.
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their Gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
Well, he's not here.
No, no one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran!
I ran and I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do, okay.
Here's what I do.
Okay, I'm standing there, and I'm running, and I see the beast, just coming towards me, so I just stepped to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me,
I take my sword,
I draw it, and I lop off its head.
Yeah, and I bend over, I pick it up, and I walk in triumph... back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my dear, oh my giant friend,
I did, and let me tell you this...
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night, if you know what I mean.
"He's such a dandy!"
Repeatedly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on here?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours, and Lucius turns you all into stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
- Herbs and gourds?
- Please, the medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
You're really telling me the ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- Oh, you're just taking his word for it?
You got a problem with that?
Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla... this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy, and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet, but... he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah, reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
This Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman, make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
- Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and... surveillance footage from his quarters.
What's this?
I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid still in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
- I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
- He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you just fly to a planet, you take the Gate, you fly away.
Well, we try to take Stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet, and then only if the planet is uninhabited.
Obviously, it wouldn't be right to take a Gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I think I've heard of this planet.
You have?
Yeah, I have.
And I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I've got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the Gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two Bs.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the Gate harvesting program.
Yeah, I heard.
And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that, too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
No.
- Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
I'm not going to send a team down there, not when there's still plenty of Gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong... with all your advanced weapons, you could easily dispose of a tiny wraith outpost, if there even is an outpost, but ultimately, is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
I mean, sure,
- people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John... are you questioning my authority?
When it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that Gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
- He's really a good man.
- I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Elizabeth wants to send a team to check out a Gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- What is she, nuts?
- Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
- Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
You need to figure out why without drawing too much attention.
I am working on it, but there's not enough of the liquid to work with.
I need more.
I'll go back to Lucius's village.
I'm sure he keeps a stash there.
I'll just grab some.
You're leaving me here alone?
- You said you need the liquid.
- Yeah, but the place is turning into a nuthouse.
Somebody's got to stay.
Just keep away from the nuts.
And you've got to disable the DHD as soon a I'm gone to prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard!
Are you all right?
Where is he?
Lucius?
Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day, as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people, he told me a story, a wonderful, wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward, we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once, and since he has gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink a... a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
I could bring it to him.
We both can.
I can handle it.
If we get you some... will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
And the next day she became my wife, my fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel, you know that's what you are.
Sheppard, come here.
You've got to hear this.
Lucius was just telling the most hysterical story.
Do you know that they have marmots on his planet?
Well, they're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent very similar to...
I thought you said you were gonna stay away from the nuts.
Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself, but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down,
Ronon held me against the wall, and Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
Oh, you did.
And let me tell you, we have nothing to worry about with this guy.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Elizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
We thought that you were them.
Teyla, Ronon, and Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- To disable the DHD.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I didn't.
But come on.
- Ronon and Teyla.
I mean, they can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
Well, he... now, he can walk on his hands.
Did you know that?
He was showing Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay!
We don't know for sure that there are even Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, though, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett!
We're coming in hot!
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
- Well, firstly, they volunteered.
- And secondly... we got the herb.
Carson,
I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
You will?
Yes, I will.
- You sent them to get an herb?
- We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on Earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend... and there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
So, what does this do?
That engages the HUD.
Stands for "heads up display".
Heads up...
I love that.
It gives me whatever information I need when flying the Jumper.
Navigation, weapons...
- You can fly this?
- I can fly it, too.
Yes, now that you received the A.T.A. Therapy, which I invented.
I was actually born with the gene, which makes me much more proficient at operating ancient technology.
It does not.
He doesn't fly this thing any better than I do.
Don't you lie to Lucius...
All right... boys, stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone such as me to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to be able to use some of it as well.
Really?
A gene, huh?
You said an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting...
if you look at this down here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I... think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
You see, once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper three is starting up.
Who's in it?
I don't know.
Jumper three, please identify.
Jumper three, this is flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...
Why...
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- This has never happened before.
- You know, we have very, very strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key or something...
A security officer saw Colonel Sheppard carrying Dr. Beckett toward the Jumper bay moments before the Jumper took off.
So it was them in the flying machine?
My computer's missing.
A tablet, two drives, all of my research.
I told you that man was dangerous.
- I have to say, Liz, I am very disappointed right now.
- I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
- I want them found.
- Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it right now, but what you're going through is kind of like a... a detox.
Now, according to the research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club, that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone, and then there's something about gamma activity in the prefrontral cortrex.
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See, that's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone, in close proximity, it makes them... easy to influence, and the longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish!
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of extract made from the herb that you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus...
I haven't been around him much.
Look...
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere until the pheromone wore off, but the people back on his home planet are starting to get sick, and it looks like they're going to get worse before they get better.
I don't want to put our people through that.
You're doing it to me right now!
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's got to be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is probably worried.
You think he's worried?
Jumper two, report.
We're reading several life signs, but they might be Athosian hunting parties, we're going to go check them out.
- Is Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
That thing is set to stun, right?
Yeah.
Good.
Carson are you all right?
I will be once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, Colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Elizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So... that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discover but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How did you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment... and I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became "like".
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Until we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate... and everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just want to help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't want to do.
Six wives?
Sometimes all at once.
You know, when you get over this cold, you and I are going to have a long chat, face to face, and I've got a feeling we're going to become the best of friends,
and you're going to want to help me, too all the time, and you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius... you get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, Colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
I've finished preparing the inoculation.
All right, I'll be right down.
I've got to go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
He's giving you the A.T.A. therapy?
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember,
- it's only effective in 47% of those who receive it.
- Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you feeling okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would be no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue jello.
Just a little bit of whipped cream.
Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper one, this is flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
"Go for launch".
That's so exciting.
Thanks Rodney.
All right, here goes.
I'll take it from here.
You're supposed to be in jail.
Carson.
Save your breath, your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No... no, but...
Carson... we're supposed to be best of friends.
Carson didn't give you the A.T.A. gene.
What?
I'm afraid it's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face to face conversation you always wanted us to have.
The only thing that will happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait!
They're taking off.
It worked!
He's flying it.
"He flies.
He flies so beautifully!"
Fly, Lucius, fly.
Where are you taking me?
Little vacation.
Just enough time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to the rest of my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe i'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, Colonel, I can't thank you enough.
- Thank you so much...
- After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius' homecoming?
Well... they didn't kill him, although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
That's if they haven't strung him up first.
Well, the townspeople are over their withdrawal and on the mend, so I doubt that will happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I would track him down,
- hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here... back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us thank you.
All right, all right.
Hey, buddy, I'd better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste, for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
Are you all right, colonel?
It's nothing, just a cold.
No big deal.
Just annoying.
- Talk about annoying...
- What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. Detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
Identifying space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of a backwater hamlet.
- Are you that eager to return to Earth?
- This isn't about me.
It's the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.
- And whenever I want to.
- How's that work, again?
Okay.
Once we've seeded enough stargates between Pegasus and the Milky Way we'll take a Jumper from one to the other till we reach the other side.
We won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus.
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs and get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
We should probably go.
Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, when you're right, you're right.
- We're here now...
Hello.
Hello, new people.
Why didn't anybody tell me they were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Willa, I was just out for a walk.
- Have you met the new people yet?
- We just got here.
Oh, great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives, they're just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Fair day, everybody.
Fair day, Lucius.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla.
- And you are from...?
- Athos.
Athos.
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
Sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, have lunch, talk about this?
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows.
He's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh, people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then, Lucius we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch, huh?
Everybody has to eat.
Come on.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Fair day.
Fair day.
- Fair day.
Here I come.
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really but hasn't stopped me from trying.
- I see.
- Is she taken yet?
- No.
Nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
Yeah, I love a woman with spirit.
And a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius.
Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners.
- What is it about you...?
- I know so you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those gifts?
Exploration.
Alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that just like that.
- It's just a cold.
- Nevertheless.
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
- That's impressive.
- You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So where y'all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk.
I look up and I heard...
Somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- Where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes, they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Well, perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
- Or perhaps not.
- What?
You come all this way you don't even wanna do a trade?
Doesn't have to be the ship.
I don't want it.
You gotta have some other stuff to trade.
Okay, like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great, but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
- For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we'd love to stay, we really must go.
No.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
We haven't had the second course.
Please, I want you to see my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
- Another time, Lucius.
We gotta go.
- No.
No, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what.
Soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer, then we'll talk about trade.
- Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might be worth having Beckett check out.
I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer soon.
- So it's back out to scout for gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
- Every single one?
- Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, Thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man."
Young, old, women.
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up, just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say "be with you," right?
- I think so, yes.
I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway, huh?
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well, we found an unused gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
You know, I was a kid myself.
I take the baby and I open my coat and I tuck the baby inside.
And I start stroking the baby's back.
Gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again but beat it did.
And a cry arose piercing the cold night air as if to say "I am alive."
Astonishing.
And that baby...
That baby grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain-damaged, but just a little, but the story is true.
And thank you for sharing it with me.
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most:
To share.
To share me.
And I can see that now.
You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- May I call you Carson?
- Of course.
This city that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is?
- Oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
We have several.
Oh, yeah.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Ach, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my!
When you said this place was a 10 I thought, Okay, maybe it's an eight and a half," but this...
- Carson?
- Oh, Dr. Weir permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning...
You never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
- I didn't think you'd mind.
- You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
This the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
- Really?
That guy?
- Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
- It's just, you're acting a little...
- Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger without prior approval.
Now he knows about the city, as well as our gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace.
As our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value.
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could have my personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know I'll take a look at what you have, if you insist but this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
Well, I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
Oh, Lucius.
Just give them a chance to get to know you.
- Well, I just hope I get that chance.
- Oh, you will, I promise.
I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Hello.
I was gonna go get something to eat.
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me, then?
- You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
I'm sorry.
My manners fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
- Isn't she something, huh?
- Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit all alone.
Please?
- We'll both take you.
Both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other, then, okay?
Like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol, endangering...
And for that, I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my home world topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.
What are you doing?
I was told that you'd like to negotiate an alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
That's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then, why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us?
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet?
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
- Well, he's not here.
- No.
No one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran.
I ran.
And, mind you, I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do.
Okay.
I'm standing there and I'm running and I see the beast just coming towards me so I just step to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me I take my sword, I draw it and I lop off its head.
And...
Yeah.
And I bend over, I pick it up and I walk in triumph back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my giant friend, I did, and let me tell you this:
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night.
If you know what I mean.
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours and Lucius turns you all into Stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
Herbs and gourds?
Please.
The medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
The ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- You're taking his word for it?
- You got a problem with that?
- Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla, this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet but he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah.
Reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and...
Surveillance footage from his quarters.
- What's this?
- I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you fly to a planet, you take the gate, you fly away.
We try to take stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet and then, only if the planet is uninhabited.
It wouldn't be right to take a gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I've heard of this planet.
- You have?
- Yeah, I have and I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two B's.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the gate-harvesting program.
- Yeah, I heard.
- And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
- No.
Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
Not gonna send a team down there when there's still plenty of gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons you could easily dispose of a tiny Wraith outpost, if there even is one.
But ultimately is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
- Sure, people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John, are you questioning my authority?
Yeah, when it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
He's really a good man.
I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Élizabeth wants to send a team to check out a gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts?
Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.
I'm working on it, but there's not enough liquid.
- I need more.
- I'll go back to Lucius'village.
- I'm sure he keeps a stash.
- You're leaving me here alone?
You said you need the liquid.
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody's gotta stay.
Keep away from the nuts.
Disable the DHD as soon as I'm gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard.
- Are you all right?
- Where is he?
- Lucius?
- Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people he told me a story, a wonderful wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once and since he is gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink, like, a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
- I could bring it to him.
- We both can.
I can handle it.
Well, if we get you some, will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
I did.
I jumped in.
I jump in the marsh and I'm looking at four of them.
I know, I mean, four of them there and I don't know which one to save.
- What did you do?
And the next day, she became my wife.
My fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel.
That's what you are.
Come here.
You gotta hear this.
Lucius was telling the most hysterical story.
You know they have marmots on his planet?
They're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent similar...
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down...
Ronon held me against the wall.
-
-And Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
- Oh, you did?
- And let me tell you we have nothing to worry about.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Élizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- Disable the DHD, I know.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
But come on Ronon and Teyla can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay.
We don't know for sure that there are Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett.
We're coming in hot.
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
Well, firstly, they volunteered.
And secondly, we got the herb.
Carson, I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
- You will?
- Yes, I will.
You sent them to get an herb?
We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
What does this do?
That engages the HUD, Heads Up Display.
Heads up.
I love that.
It gives me information when flying the Jumper:
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing?
- I can fly it too.
- Yes.
Now that you received the ATA therapy, which I invented.
I was born with a gene which makes me more proficient at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn't fly any better.
- Don't you lie...
- All right, all right.
Boys stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to use it.
Really?
A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting.
If you look at this here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
Once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper 3's starting up.
Who's in it?
- I don't know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...?
Why...?
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- Never.
We have strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key...
- A security officer saw Sheppard carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay before the Jumper took off.
- So it was them in the flying machine?
- My computer's missing.
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- I told you that man was dangerous.
I have to say, I am very disappointed right now.
I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
I want them found.
Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it now but what you're going through is kind of like a detox.
Now, according to research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone and then there's something about gamma activity in the "prefrontral cortrex."
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See?
That's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them easy to influence.
The longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish.
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of an extract made from the herb you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus, I haven't been around him much.
Look.
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere till the pheromone wore off but the people back on his planet are starting to get sick.
It looks like they're gonna get worse.
I don't want to put our people through that.
- You're doing it to me right now.
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's gotta be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is worried.
- You think he's worried?
- Jumper 2, report.
We're reading several life signs.
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We'll check them.
- Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
- That thing's set to stun, right?
- Yeah.
Good.
Carson, are you all right?
I will be, once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Élizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discovery, but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How'd you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment.
-
-And I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became like.
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Then we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate.
And everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just wanna help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't wanna do.
- Six wives.
Sometimes all at once.
When you get over this cold, we're gonna have a long chat.
Face to face.
And I got a feeling we're gonna become the best of friends.
And you're gonna wanna help me too, all the time.
And you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius.
You get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
- I've finished preparing the inoculation.
- All right, I'll be right down.
I gotta go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
- Giving you the ATA therapy?
- Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember, it's only effective in 47 percent of those who receive it.
Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue Jell-O.
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper 1, this is Flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
"Go for launch." That's so exciting.
Thanks, Rodney.
All right, here goes.
- I'll take it from here.
- What...?
Wait.
You're supposed to be in jail.
- Carson.
- Save your breath.
Your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No.
No, but, Carson...
- We're supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn't give you the ATA gene.
What?
It's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face-to-face conversation you wanted us to have.
The only thing that'll happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
Okay, I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait.
They're taking off.
It worked.
He's flying it.
Fly, Lucius, fly.
- Where are you taking me?
- Little vacation.
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe I'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, colonel, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much...
After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius'homecoming?
Well, they didn't kill him although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
If they haven't strung him up first.
The townspeople are over their withdrawal.
I doubt that'll happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I'd track him down hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us, thank you.
All right, all right.
Anyway, I better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
Are you all right, colonel?
It's nothing, just a cold.
No big deal.
Just annoying.
- Talk about annoying...
- What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. Detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
Identifying space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of a backwater hamlet.
- Are you that eager to return to Earth?
- This isn't about me.
It's the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.
- And whenever I want to.
- How's that work, again?
Okay.
Once we've seeded enough stargates between Pegasus and the Milky Way we'll take a Jumper from one to the other till we reach the other side.
We won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus.
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs and get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
We should probably go.
Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, when you're right, you're right.
- We're here now...
Hello.
Hello, new people.
Why didn't anybody tell me they were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Willa, I was just out for a walk.
- Have you met the new people yet?
- We just got here.
Oh, great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives, they're just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Fair day, everybody.
Fair day, Lucius.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla.
- And you are from...?
- Athos.
Athos.
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
Sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, have lunch, talk about this?
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows.
He's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh, people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then, Lucius we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch, huh?
Everybody has to eat.
Come on.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Fair day.
Fair day.
- Fair day.
Here I come.
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really but hasn't stopped me from trying.
- I see.
- Is she taken yet?
- No.
Nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
Yeah, I love a woman with spirit.
And a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius.
Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners.
- What is it about you...?
- I know so you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those gifts?
Exploration.
Alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that just like that.
- It's just a cold.
- Nevertheless.
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
- That's impressive.
- You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So where y'all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk.
I look up and I heard...
Somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- Where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes, they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Well, perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
- Or perhaps not.
- What?
You come all this way you don't even wanna do a trade?
Doesn't have to be the ship.
I don't want it.
You gotta have some other stuff to trade.
Okay, like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great, but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
- For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we'd love to stay, we really must go.
No.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
We haven't had the second course.
Please, I want you to see my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
- Another time, Lucius.
We gotta go.
- No.
No, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what.
Soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer, then we'll talk about trade.
- Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might be worth having Beckett check out.
I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer soon.
- So it's back out to scout for gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
- Every single one?
- Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, " ou "?
Thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man. "
Young, old, women.
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up, just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say " be with you, " right?
- I think so, yes.
I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway, huh?
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well, we found an unused gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
You know, I was a kid myself.
I take the baby and I open my coat and I tuck the baby inside.
And I start stroking the baby's back.
Gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again but beat it did.
And a cry arose piercing the cold night air as if to say " ou "?
I am alive. "
Astonishing.
And that baby...
That baby grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain-damaged, but just a little, but the story is true.
And thank you for sharing it with me.
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most:
To share.
To share me.
And I can see that now.
You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- May I call you Carson?
- Of course.
This city that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is?
- Oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
We have several.
Oh, yeah.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Ach, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my!
When you said this place was a 10 I thought, " ou "?
Okay, maybe it's an eight and a half, " but this...
- Carson?
- Oh, Dr. Weir permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning...
You never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
- I didn't think you'd mind.
- You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
This the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
- Really?
That guy?
- Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
- It's just, you're acting a little...
- Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger without prior approval.
Now he knows about the city, as well as our gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace.
As our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value.
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could have my personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know I'll take a look at what you have, if you insist but this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
Well, I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
Oh, Lucius.
Just give them a chance to get to know you.
- Well, I just hope I get that chance.
- Oh, you will, I promise.
I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Hello.
I was gonna go get something to eat.
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me, then?
- You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
I'm sorry.
My manners fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
- Isn't she something, huh?
- Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit all alone.
Please?
- We'll both take you.
Both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other, then, okay?
Like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol, endangering...
And for that, I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my home world topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.
What are you doing?
I was told that you'd like to negotiate an alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
That's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then, why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us?
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet?
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
- Well, he's not here.
- No.
No one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran.
I ran.
And, mind you, I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do.
Okay.
I'm standing there and I'm running and I see the beast just coming towards me so I just step to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me I take my sword, I draw it and I lop off its head.
And...
Yeah.
And I bend over, I pick it up and I walk in triumph back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my giant friend, I did, and let me tell you this:
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night.
If you know what I mean.
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours and Lucius turns you all into Stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
Herbs and gourds?
Please.
The medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
The ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- You're taking his word for it?
- You got a problem with that?
- Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla, this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet but he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah.
Reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and...
Surveillance footage from his quarters.
- What's this?
- I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you fly to a planet, you take the gate, you fly away.
We try to take stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet and then, only if the planet is uninhabited.
It wouldn't be right to take a gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I've heard of this planet.
- You have?
- Yeah, I have and I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two B's.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the gate-harvesting program.
- Yeah, I heard.
- And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
- No.
Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
Not gonna send a team down there when there's still plenty of gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons you could easily dispose of a tiny Wraith outpost, if there even is one.
But ultimately is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
- Sure, people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John, are you questioning my authority?
Yeah, when it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
He's really a good man.
I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Élizabeth wants to send a team to check out a gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts?
Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.
I'm working on it, but there's not enough liquid.
- I need more.
- I'll go back to Lucius'village.
- I'm sure he keeps a stash.
- You're leaving me here alone?
You said you need the liquid.
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody's gotta stay.
Keep away from the nuts.
Disable the DHD as soon as I'm gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard.
- Are you all right?
- Where is he?
- Lucius?
- Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people he told me a story, a wonderful wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once and since he is gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink, like, a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
- I could bring it to him.
- We both can.
I can handle it.
Well, if we get you some, will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
I did.
I jumped in.
I jump in the marsh and I'm looking at four of them.
I know, I mean, four of them there and I don't know which one to save.
- What did you do?
And the next day, she became my wife.
My fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel.
That's what you are.
Come here.
You gotta hear this.
Lucius was telling the most hysterical story.
You know they have marmots on his planet?
They're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent similar...
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down...
Ronon held me against the wall.
-
-And Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
- Oh, you did?
- And let me tell you we have nothing to worry about.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Élizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- Disable the DHD, I know.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
But come on Ronon and Teyla can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay.
We don't know for sure that there are Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett.
We're coming in hot.
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
Well, firstly, they volunteered.
And secondly, we got the herb.
Carson, I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
- You will?
- Yes, I will.
You sent them to get an herb?
We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
What does this do?
That engages the HUD, Heads Up Display.
Heads up.
I love that.
It gives me information when flying the Jumper:
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing?
- I can fly it too.
- Yes.
Now that you received the ATA therapy, which I invented.
I was born with a gene which makes me more proficient at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn't fly any better.
- Don't you lie...
- All right, all right.
Boys stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to use it.
Really?
A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting.
If you look at this here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
Once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper 3's starting up.
Who's in it?
- I don't know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...?
Why...?
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- Never.
We have strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key...
- A security officer saw Sheppard carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay before the Jumper took off.
- So it was them in the flying machine?
- My computer's missing.
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- I told you that man was dangerous.
I have to say, I am very disappointed right now.
I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
I want them found.
Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it now but what you're going through is kind of like a detox.
Now, according to research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone and then there's something about gamma activity in the " prefrontral cortrex. "
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See?
That's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them easy to influence.
The longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish.
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of an extract made from the herb you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus, I haven't been around him much.
Look.
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere till the pheromone wore off but the people back on his planet are starting to get sick.
It looks like they're gonna get worse.
I don't want to put our people through that.
- You're doing it to me right now.
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's gotta be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is worried.
- You think he's worried?
- Jumper 2, report.
We're reading several life signs.
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We'll check them.
- Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
- That thing's set to stun, right?
- Yeah.
Good.
Carson, are you all right?
I will be, once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Élizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discovery, but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How'd you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment.
-
-And I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became like.
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Then we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate.
And everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just wanna help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't wanna do.
- Six wives.
Sometimes all at once.
When you get over this cold, we're gonna have a long chat.
Face to face.
And I got a feeling we're gonna become the best of friends.
And you're gonna wanna help me too, all the time.
And you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius.
You get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
- I've finished preparing the inoculation.
- All right, I'll be right down.
I gotta go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
- Giving you the ATA therapy?
- Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember, it's only effective in 47 percent of those who receive it.
Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue Jell-O.
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper 1, this is Flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
" Go for launch. " That's so exciting.
Thanks, Rodney.
All right, here goes.
- I'll take it from here.
- What...?
Wait.
You're supposed to be in jail.
- Carson.
- Save your breath.
Your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No.
No, but, Carson...
- We're supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn't give you the ATA gene.
What?
It's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face-to-face conversation you wanted us to have.
The only thing that'll happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
Okay, I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait.
They're taking off.
It worked.
He's flying it.
Fly, Lucius, fly.
- Where are you taking me?
- Little vacation.
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe I'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, colonel, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much...
After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius'homecoming?
Well, they didn't kill him although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
If they haven't strung him up first.
The townspeople are over their withdrawal.
I doubt that'll happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I'd track him down hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us, thank you.
All right, all right.
Anyway, I better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.

[ENGLISH]
Are you all right, colonel?
It's nothing, just a cold.
No big deal.
Just annoying.
- Talk about annoying...
- What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. Detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
Identifying space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of a backwater hamlet.
- Are you that eager to return to Earth?
- This isn't about me.
It's the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.
- And whenever I want to.
- How's that work, again?
Okay.
Once we've seeded enough stargates between Pegasus and the Milky Way we'll take a Jumper from one to the other till we reach the other side.
We won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus.
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs and get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
We should probably go.
Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, when you're right, you're right.
- We're here now...
Hello.
Hello, new people.
Why didn't anybody tell me they were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Willa, I was just out for a walk.
- Have you met the new people yet?
- We just got here.
Oh, great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives, they're just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Fair day, everybody.
Fair day, Lucius.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla.
- And you are from...?
- Athos.
Athos.
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
Sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, have lunch, talk about this?
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows.
He's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh, people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then, Lucius we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch, huh?
Everybody has to eat.
Come on.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Fair day.
Fair day.
- Fair day.
Here I come.
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really but hasn't stopped me from trying.
- I see.
- Is she taken yet?
- No.
Nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
Yeah, I love a woman with spirit.
And a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius.
Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners.
- What is it about you...?
- I know so you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those gifts?
Exploration.
Alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that just like that.
- It's just a cold.
- Nevertheless.
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
- That's impressive.
- You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So where y'all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk.
I look up and I heard...
Somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- Where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes, they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Well, perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
- Or perhaps not.
- What?
You come all this way you don't even wanna do a trade?
Doesn't have to be the ship.
I don't want it.
You gotta have some other stuff to trade.
Okay, like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great, but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
- For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we'd love to stay, we really must go.
No.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
We haven't had the second course.
Please, I want you to see my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
- Another time, Lucius.
We gotta go.
- No.
No, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what.
Soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer, then we'll talk about trade.
- Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might be worth having Beckett check out.
I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer soon.
- So it's back out to scout for gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
- Every single one?
- Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, " ou "?
Thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man. "
Young, old, women.
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up, just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say " be with you, " right?
- I think so, yes.
I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway, huh?
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well, we found an unused gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
You know, I was a kid myself.
I take the baby and I open my coat and I tuck the baby inside.
And I start stroking the baby's back.
Gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again but beat it did.
And a cry arose piercing the cold night air as if to say " ou "?
I am alive. "
Astonishing.
And that baby...
That baby grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain-damaged, but just a little, but the story is true.
And thank you for sharing it with me.
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most:
To share.
To share me.
And I can see that now.
You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- May I call you Carson?
- Of course.
This city that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is?
- Oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
We have several.
Oh, yeah.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Ach, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my!
When you said this place was a 10 I thought, " ou "?
Okay, maybe it's an eight and a half, " but this...
- Carson?
- Oh, Dr. Weir permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning...
You never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
- I didn't think you'd mind.
- You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
This the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
- Really?
That guy?
- Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
- It's just, you're acting a little...
- Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger without prior approval.
Now he knows about the city, as well as our gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace.
As our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value.
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could have my personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know I'll take a look at what you have, if you insist but this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
Well, I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
Oh, Lucius.
Just give them a chance to get to know you.
- Well, I just hope I get that chance.
- Oh, you will, I promise.
I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Hello.
I was gonna go get something to eat.
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me, then?
- You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
I'm sorry.
My manners fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
- Isn't she something, huh?
- Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit all alone.
Please?
- We'll both take you.
Both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other, then, okay?
Like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol, endangering...
And for that, I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my home world topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.
What are you doing?
I was told that you'd like to negotiate an alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
That's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then, why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us?
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet?
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
- Well, he's not here.
- No.
No one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran.
I ran.
And, mind you, I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do.
Okay.
I'm standing there and I'm running and I see the beast just coming towards me so I just step to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me I take my sword, I draw it and I lop off its head.
And...
Yeah.
And I bend over, I pick it up and I walk in triumph back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my giant friend, I did, and let me tell you this:
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night.
If you know what I mean.
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours and Lucius turns you all into Stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
Herbs and gourds?
Please.
The medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
The ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- You're taking his word for it?
- You got a problem with that?
- Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla, this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet but he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah.
Reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and...
Surveillance footage from his quarters.
- What's this?
- I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you fly to a planet, you take the gate, you fly away.
We try to take stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet and then, only if the planet is uninhabited.
It wouldn't be right to take a gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I've heard of this planet.
- You have?
- Yeah, I have and I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two B's.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the gate-harvesting program.
- Yeah, I heard.
- And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
- No.
Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
Not gonna send a team down there when there's still plenty of gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons you could easily dispose of a tiny Wraith outpost, if there even is one.
But ultimately is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
- Sure, people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John, are you questioning my authority?
Yeah, when it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
He's really a good man.
I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Élizabeth wants to send a team to check out a gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts?
Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.
I'm working on it, but there's not enough liquid.
- I need more.
- I'll go back to Lucius'village.
- I'm sure he keeps a stash.
- You're leaving me here alone?
You said you need the liquid.
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody's gotta stay.
Keep away from the nuts.
Disable the DHD as soon as I'm gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard.
- Are you all right?
- Where is he?
- Lucius?
- Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people he told me a story, a wonderful wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once and since he is gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink, like, a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
- I could bring it to him.
- We both can.
I can handle it.
Well, if we get you some, will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
I did.
I jumped in.
I jump in the marsh and I'm looking at four of them.
I know, I mean, four of them there and I don't know which one to save.
- What did you do?
And the next day, she became my wife.
My fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel.
That's what you are.
Come here.
You gotta hear this.
Lucius was telling the most hysterical story.
You know they have marmots on his planet?
They're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent similar...
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down...
Ronon held me against the wall.
-
-And Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
- Oh, you did?
- And let me tell you we have nothing to worry about.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Élizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- Disable the DHD, I know.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
But come on Ronon and Teyla can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay.
We don't know for sure that there are Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett.
We're coming in hot.
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
Well, firstly, they volunteered.
And secondly, we got the herb.
Carson, I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
- You will?
- Yes, I will.
You sent them to get an herb?
We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
What does this do?
That engages the HUD, Heads Up Display.
Heads up.
I love that.
It gives me information when flying the Jumper:
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing?
- I can fly it too.
- Yes.
Now that you received the ATA therapy, which I invented.
I was born with a gene which makes me more proficient at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn't fly any better.
- Don't you lie...
- All right, all right.
Boys stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to use it.
Really?
A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting.
If you look at this here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
Once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper 3's starting up.
Who's in it?
- I don't know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...?
Why...?
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- Never.
We have strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key...
- A security officer saw Sheppard carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay before the Jumper took off.
- So it was them in the flying machine?
- My computer's missing.
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- I told you that man was dangerous.
I have to say, I am very disappointed right now.
I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
I want them found.
Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it now but what you're going through is kind of like a detox.
Now, according to research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone and then there's something about gamma activity in the " prefrontral cortrex. "
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See?
That's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them easy to influence.
The longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish.
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of an extract made from the herb you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus, I haven't been around him much.
Look.
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere till the pheromone wore off but the people back on his planet are starting to get sick.
It looks like they're gonna get worse.
I don't want to put our people through that.
- You're doing it to me right now.
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's gotta be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is worried.
- You think he's worried?
- Jumper 2, report.
We're reading several life signs.
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We'll check them.
- Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
- That thing's set to stun, right?
- Yeah.
Good.
Carson, are you all right?
I will be, once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Élizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discovery, but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How'd you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment.
-
-And I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became like.
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Then we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate.
And everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just wanna help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't wanna do.
- Six wives.
Sometimes all at once.
When you get over this cold, we're gonna have a long chat.
Face to face.
And I got a feeling we're gonna become the best of friends.
And you're gonna wanna help me too, all the time.
And you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius.
You get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
- I've finished preparing the inoculation.
- All right, I'll be right down.
I gotta go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
- Giving you the ATA therapy?
- Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember, it's only effective in 47 percent of those who receive it.
Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue Jell-O.
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper 1, this is Flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
" Go for launch. " That's so exciting.
Thanks, Rodney.
All right, here goes.
- I'll take it from here.
- What...?
Wait.
You're supposed to be in jail.
- Carson.
- Save your breath.
Your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No.
No, but, Carson...
- We're supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn't give you the ATA gene.
What?
It's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face-to-face conversation you wanted us to have.
The only thing that'll happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
Okay, I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait.
They're taking off.
It worked.
He's flying it.
Fly, Lucius, fly.
- Where are you taking me?
- Little vacation.
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe I'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, colonel, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much...
After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius'homecoming?
Well, they didn't kill him although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
If they haven't strung him up first.
The townspeople are over their withdrawal.
I doubt that'll happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I'd track him down hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us, thank you.
All right, all right.
Anyway, I better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
corrections and synchro by THU22
Are you all right, Colonel?
It's nothing.
Just a cold.
No big deal.
It's just annoying.
Talk about annoying.
What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space Gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney, but the MALP detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
I'm just saying that identifying potential space Gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of some backwater hamlet.
Are you that eager to return to Earth, Rodney?
This isn't just about me.
It is about the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently... and whenever I want to.
- How's that work again?
- Okay... once we've seeded enough Stargates across the void between Pegasus and the Milky Way, we'll be able to take a Jumper from one to the other to the other, till we reach the other side.
That way, we won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus, and travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs, and... get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
- We should probably go.
- Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, no, when you're right, you're right.
- No, we're here now...
Hello!
Hello, new people!
Why didn't anybody tell me the new people were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Oh, please.
Well, I was just out for a walk.
Have you met the new people yet?
We just got here.
Oh, great.
Great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife, Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives are just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello, sweetheart.
I love ya.
I love ya.
- Fair day, everybody.
- Fair day Lucius.
Fair day.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex.
Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla... and you are from...
- Athos.
- Athos...
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
It sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, we have some lunch, we talk about this...
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows... he's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then...
Lucius... we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch...
Everybody has to eat, right come one.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
Fair day.
Fair day, Lucius.
Fair day.
Fair day.
Here I come!
Season 3, Episode 3 Irresistible
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really, but... it hasn't stopped me from trying.
I see.
Is she taken yet?
No... nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
I love a woman with spirit... and a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius, please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners, but
- what is it exactly about you...
- I know what you're going to say.
So you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those... gifts?
Exploration, alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that, just...
- just like that.
- It's just a cold.
Nevertheless,
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
That's impressive.
You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So... where are you all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine of yours.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk, I look up... and I heard and somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- I mean, where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes... they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Or perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
Or perhaps not.
What, you come all this way, you don't even want to do a trade?
Look, it doesn't have to be the ship.
Forget the ship.
I don't even want the ship, okay?
You've got to have some other stuff that you want to trade, right?
Okay like... how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great,
- but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we would love to stay, we really must go.
No, no, no.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
Come on, come on.
We haven't even had the second course.
Please!
I want you to see some of my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
Another time, Lucius.
We've got to go.
No... no, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what...
soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer.
Then we'll talk about trade.
Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
- You won't be disappointed!
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
Then again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicine.
Sounds like a snake oil salesman to me, but it might be worth having Beckett check it out.
Well, I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer pretty quickly.
- So it's back out to scout for Gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet on my walks, but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess,
I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
Every single one?
Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, "thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man".
Young, old... women...
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up around the square just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say "be with you", right?
- I think so, yes.
- I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid
I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway...
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well... we found an unused Gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy Gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair anyway, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest Gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay a little longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know, what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
I was a kid myself.
I take the baby, and I open my coat, and I tuck the baby inside, and I start stroking the baby's back, gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again,
but beat it did... and a cry arose, piercing the cold night air, as if to say...
I... am... alive.
Astonishing.
And that baby... that baby... grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain damage, but just a little, but the story is true.
- And thank you for sharing it with me.
- Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most... to share.
To share me.
- And I can see that now.
- You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- may I call you Carson?
- Of course you can.
Carson, this City that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
- Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is... oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
Oh, aye, we have several.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Look, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my.
When you said this place was a ten, I thought, "okay, maybe... maybe it's an eight and a half,"
but this...
Carson?
Dr. Weir... permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning... you never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
Is this the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
Really?
That guy?
Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney.
Gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
It's just you're acting... a little...
Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
This is not something to treat lightly.
No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger to Atlantis without prior approval.
Now he knows about the City, as well as our Gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace, as our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value to us.
We'll just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out to scout more Gates.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could always have my own personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know, I'll take a look at what you have if you insist, but... this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
Oh, I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
- Lucius just give them a chance to get to know you.
- I just hope I get that chance.
Oh, you will, I promise.
In fact, I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Oh, hello.
I was going to go get something to eat, because they forgot to bring me something, so... are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about the City unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me then?
You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
- I'm sorry.
My manners just fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
Isn't she something?
Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no, no.
Come on.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit in there all alone.
Come on, please?
- Very well.
We will both take you.
Oh, both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other then, okay.
Like how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems... excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol,
- endangering...
- and for that I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
- It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
- No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my homeworld, topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
Please, have a seat.
After you.
What are you doing?
I've been told that you would like to negotiate a possible alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
I mean, that's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then... why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us.
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet.
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their Gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
Well, he's not here.
No, no one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran!
I ran and I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do, okay.
Here's what I do.
Okay, I'm standing there, and I'm running, and I see the beast, just coming towards me, so I just stepped to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me,
I take my sword,
I draw it, and I lop off its head.
Yeah, and I bend over, I pick it up, and I walk in triumph... back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my dear, oh my giant friend,
I did, and let me tell you this...
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night, if you know what I mean.
"He's such a dandy!"
Repeatedly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on here?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours, and Lucius turns you all into stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
- Herbs and gourds?
- Please, the medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
You're really telling me the ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- Oh, you're just taking his word for it?
You got a problem with that?
Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla... this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy, and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet, but... he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah, reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
This Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman, make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
- Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and... surveillance footage from his quarters.
What's this?
I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid still in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
- I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
- He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you just fly to a planet, you take the Gate, you fly away.
Well, we try to take Stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet, and then only if the planet is uninhabited.
Obviously, it wouldn't be right to take a Gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I think I've heard of this planet.
You have?
Yeah, I have.
And I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I've got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the Gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two Bs.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the Gate harvesting program.
Yeah, I heard.
And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that, too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
No.
- Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
I'm not going to send a team down there, not when there's still plenty of Gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong... with all your advanced weapons, you could easily dispose of a tiny wraith outpost, if there even is an outpost, but ultimately, is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
I mean, sure,
- people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John... are you questioning my authority?
When it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that Gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
- He's really a good man.
- I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Elizabeth wants to send a team to check out a Gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- What is she, nuts?
- Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
- Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
You need to figure out why without drawing too much attention.
I am working on it, but there's not enough of the liquid to work with.
I need more.
I'll go back to Lucius's village.
I'm sure he keeps a stash there.
I'll just grab some.
You're leaving me here alone?
- You said you need the liquid.
- Yeah, but the place is turning into a nuthouse.
Somebody's got to stay.
Just keep away from the nuts.
And you've got to disable the DHD as soon a I'm gone to prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard!
Are you all right?
Where is he?
Lucius?
Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day, as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people, he told me a story, a wonderful, wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward, we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once, and since he has gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink a... a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
I could bring it to him.
We both can.
I can handle it.
If we get you some... will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
And the next day she became my wife, my fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel, you know that's what you are.
Sheppard, come here.
You've got to hear this.
Lucius was just telling the most hysterical story.
Do you know that they have marmots on his planet?
Well, they're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent very similar to...
I thought you said you were gonna stay away from the nuts.
Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself, but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down,
Ronon held me against the wall, and Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
Oh, you did.
And let me tell you, we have nothing to worry about with this guy.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Elizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
We thought that you were them.
Teyla, Ronon, and Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- To disable the DHD.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I didn't.
But come on.
- Ronon and Teyla.
I mean, they can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
Well, he... now, he can walk on his hands.
Did you know that?
He was showing Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay!
We don't know for sure that there are even Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, though, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett!
We're coming in hot!
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
- Well, firstly, they volunteered.
- And secondly... we got the herb.
Carson,
I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
You will?
Yes, I will.
- You sent them to get an herb?
- We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on Earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend... and there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
So, what does this do?
That engages the HUD.
Stands for "heads up display".
Heads up...
I love that.
It gives me whatever information I need when flying the Jumper.
Navigation, weapons...
- You can fly this?
- I can fly it, too.
Yes, now that you received the A.T.A. Therapy, which I invented.
I was actually born with the gene, which makes me much more proficient at operating ancient technology.
It does not.
He doesn't fly this thing any better than I do.
Don't you lie to Lucius...
All right... boys, stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone such as me to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to be able to use some of it as well.
Really?
A gene, huh?
You said an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting...
if you look at this down here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I... think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
You see, once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper three is starting up.
Who's in it?
I don't know.
Jumper three, please identify.
Jumper three, this is flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...
Why...
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- This has never happened before.
- You know, we have very, very strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key or something...
A security officer saw Colonel Sheppard carrying Dr. Beckett toward the Jumper bay moments before the Jumper took off.
So it was them in the flying machine?
My computer's missing.
A tablet, two drives, all of my research.
I told you that man was dangerous.
- I have to say, Liz, I am very disappointed right now.
- I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
- I want them found.
- Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it right now, but what you're going through is kind of like a... a detox.
Now, according to the research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club, that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone, and then there's something about gamma activity in the prefrontral cortrex.
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See, that's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone, in close proximity, it makes them... easy to influence, and the longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish!
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of extract made from the herb that you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus...
I haven't been around him much.
Look...
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere until the pheromone wore off, but the people back on his home planet are starting to get sick, and it looks like they're going to get worse before they get better.
I don't want to put our people through that.
You're doing it to me right now!
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's got to be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is probably worried.
You think he's worried?
Jumper two, report.
We're reading several life signs, but they might be Athosian hunting parties, we're going to go check them out.
- Is Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
That thing is set to stun, right?
Yeah.
Good.
Carson are you all right?
I will be once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, Colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Elizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So... that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discover but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How did you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment... and I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became "like".
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Until we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate... and everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just want to help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't want to do.
Six wives?
Sometimes all at once.
You know, when you get over this cold, you and I are going to have a long chat, face to face, and I've got a feeling we're going to become the best of friends,
and you're going to want to help me, too all the time, and you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius... you get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, Colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
I've finished preparing the inoculation.
All right, I'll be right down.
I've got to go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
He's giving you the A.T.A. therapy?
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember,
- it's only effective in 47% of those who receive it.
- Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you feeling okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would be no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue jello.
Just a little bit of whipped cream.
Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper one, this is flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
"Go for launch".
That's so exciting.
Thanks Rodney.
All right, here goes.
I'll take it from here.
You're supposed to be in jail.
Carson.
Save your breath, your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No... no, but...
Carson... we're supposed to be best of friends.
Carson didn't give you the A.T.A. gene.
What?
I'm afraid it's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face to face conversation you always wanted us to have.
The only thing that will happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait!
They're taking off.
It worked!
He's flying it.
"He flies.
He flies so beautifully!"
Fly, Lucius, fly.
Where are you taking me?
Little vacation.
Just enough time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to the rest of my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe i'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, Colonel, I can't thank you enough.
- Thank you so much...
- After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius' homecoming?
Well... they didn't kill him, although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
That's if they haven't strung him up first.
Well, the townspeople are over their withdrawal and on the mend, so I doubt that will happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I would track him down,
- hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here... back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us thank you.
All right, all right.
Hey, buddy, I'd better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste, for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
Are you all right, colonel?
It's nothing, just a cold.
No big deal.
Just annoying.
- Talk about annoying...
- What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. Detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
Identifying space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of a backwater hamlet.
- Are you that eager to return to Earth?
- This isn't about me.
It's the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.
- And whenever I want to.
- How's that work, again?
Okay.
Once we've seeded enough stargates between Pegasus and the Milky Way we'll take a Jumper from one to the other till we reach the other side.
We won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus.
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs and get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
We should probably go.
Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, when you're right, you're right.
- We're here now...
Hello.
Hello, new people.
Why didn't anybody tell me they were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Willa, I was just out for a walk.
- Have you met the new people yet?
- We just got here.
Oh, great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives, they're just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Fair day, everybody.
Fair day, Lucius.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla.
- And you are from...?
- Athos.
Athos.
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
Sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, have lunch, talk about this?
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows.
He's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh, people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then, Lucius we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch, huh?
Everybody has to eat.
Come on.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Fair day.
Fair day.
- Fair day.
Here I come.
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really but hasn't stopped me from trying.
- I see.
- Is she taken yet?
- No.
Nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
Yeah, I love a woman with spirit.
And a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius.
Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners.
- What is it about you...?
- I know so you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those gifts?
Exploration.
Alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that just like that.
- It's just a cold.
- Nevertheless.
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
- That's impressive.
- You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So where y'all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk.
I look up and I heard...
Somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- Where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes, they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Well, perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
- Or perhaps not.
- What?
You come all this way you don't even wanna do a trade?
Doesn't have to be the ship.
I don't want it.
You gotta have some other stuff to trade.
Okay, like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great, but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
- For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we'd love to stay, we really must go.
No.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
We haven't had the second course.
Please, I want you to see my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
- Another time, Lucius.
We gotta go.
- No.
No, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what.
Soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer, then we'll talk about trade.
- Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might be worth having Beckett check out.
I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer soon.
- So it's back out to scout for gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
- Every single one?
- Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, " ou "?
Thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man. "
Young, old, women.
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up, just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say " be with you, " right?
- I think so, yes.
I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway, huh?
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well, we found an unused gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
You know, I was a kid myself.
I take the baby and I open my coat and I tuck the baby inside.
And I start stroking the baby's back.
Gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again but beat it did.
And a cry arose piercing the cold night air as if to say " ou "?
I am alive. "
Astonishing.
And that baby...
That baby grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain-damaged, but just a little, but the story is true.
And thank you for sharing it with me.
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most:
To share.
To share me.
And I can see that now.
You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- May I call you Carson?
- Of course.
This city that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is?
- Oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
We have several.
Oh, yeah.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Ach, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my!
When you said this place was a 10 I thought, " ou "?
Okay, maybe it's an eight and a half, " but this...
- Carson?
- Oh, Dr. Weir permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning...
You never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
- I didn't think you'd mind.
- You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
This the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
- Really?
That guy?
- Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
- It's just, you're acting a little...
- Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger without prior approval.
Now he knows about the city, as well as our gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace.
As our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value.
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could have my personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know I'll take a look at what you have, if you insist but this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
Well, I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
Oh, Lucius.
Just give them a chance to get to know you.
- Well, I just hope I get that chance.
- Oh, you will, I promise.
I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Hello.
I was gonna go get something to eat.
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me, then?
- You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
I'm sorry.
My manners fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
- Isn't she something, huh?
- Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit all alone.
Please?
- We'll both take you.
Both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other, then, okay?
Like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol, endangering...
And for that, I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my home world topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.
What are you doing?
I was told that you'd like to negotiate an alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
That's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then, why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us?
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet?
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
- Well, he's not here.
- No.
No one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran.
I ran.
And, mind you, I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do.
Okay.
I'm standing there and I'm running and I see the beast just coming towards me so I just step to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me I take my sword, I draw it and I lop off its head.
And...
Yeah.
And I bend over, I pick it up and I walk in triumph back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my giant friend, I did, and let me tell you this:
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night.
If you know what I mean.
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours and Lucius turns you all into Stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
Herbs and gourds?
Please.
The medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
The ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- You're taking his word for it?
- You got a problem with that?
- Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla, this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet but he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah.
Reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and...
Surveillance footage from his quarters.
- What's this?
- I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you fly to a planet, you take the gate, you fly away.
We try to take stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet and then, only if the planet is uninhabited.
It wouldn't be right to take a gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I've heard of this planet.
- You have?
- Yeah, I have and I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two B's.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the gate-harvesting program.
- Yeah, I heard.
- And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
- No.
Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
Not gonna send a team down there when there's still plenty of gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons you could easily dispose of a tiny Wraith outpost, if there even is one.
But ultimately is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
- Sure, people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John, are you questioning my authority?
Yeah, when it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
He's really a good man.
I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Élizabeth wants to send a team to check out a gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts?
Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.
I'm working on it, but there's not enough liquid.
- I need more.
- I'll go back to Lucius'village.
- I'm sure he keeps a stash.
- You're leaving me here alone?
You said you need the liquid.
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody's gotta stay.
Keep away from the nuts.
Disable the DHD as soon as I'm gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard.
- Are you all right?
- Where is he?
- Lucius?
- Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people he told me a story, a wonderful wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once and since he is gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink, like, a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
- I could bring it to him.
- We both can.
I can handle it.
Well, if we get you some, will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
I did.
I jumped in.
I jump in the marsh and I'm looking at four of them.
I know, I mean, four of them there and I don't know which one to save.
- What did you do?
And the next day, she became my wife.
My fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel.
That's what you are.
Come here.
You gotta hear this.
Lucius was telling the most hysterical story.
You know they have marmots on his planet?
They're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent similar...
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down...
Ronon held me against the wall.
-
-And Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
- Oh, you did?
- And let me tell you we have nothing to worry about.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Élizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- Disable the DHD, I know.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
But come on Ronon and Teyla can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay.
We don't know for sure that there are Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett.
We're coming in hot.
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
Well, firstly, they volunteered.
And secondly, we got the herb.
Carson, I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
- You will?
- Yes, I will.
You sent them to get an herb?
We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
What does this do?
That engages the HUD, Heads Up Display.
Heads up.
I love that.
It gives me information when flying the Jumper:
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing?
- I can fly it too.
- Yes.
Now that you received the ATA therapy, which I invented.
I was born with a gene which makes me more proficient at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn't fly any better.
- Don't you lie...
- All right, all right.
Boys stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to use it.
Really?
A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting.
If you look at this here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
Once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper 3's starting up.
Who's in it?
- I don't know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...?
Why...?
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- Never.
We have strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key...
- A security officer saw Sheppard carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay before the Jumper took off.
- So it was them in the flying machine?
- My computer's missing.
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- I told you that man was dangerous.
I have to say, I am very disappointed right now.
I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
I want them found.
Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it now but what you're going through is kind of like a detox.
Now, according to research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone and then there's something about gamma activity in the " prefrontral cortrex. "
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See?
That's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them easy to influence.
The longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish.
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of an extract made from the herb you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus, I haven't been around him much.
Look.
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere till the pheromone wore off but the people back on his planet are starting to get sick.
It looks like they're gonna get worse.
I don't want to put our people through that.
- You're doing it to me right now.
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's gotta be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is worried.
- You think he's worried?
- Jumper 2, report.
We're reading several life signs.
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We'll check them.
- Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
- That thing's set to stun, right?
- Yeah.
Good.
Carson, are you all right?
I will be, once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Élizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discovery, but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How'd you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment.
-
-And I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became like.
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Then we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate.
And everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just wanna help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't wanna do.
- Six wives.
Sometimes all at once.
When you get over this cold, we're gonna have a long chat.
Face to face.
And I got a feeling we're gonna become the best of friends.
And you're gonna wanna help me too, all the time.
And you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius.
You get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
- I've finished preparing the inoculation.
- All right, I'll be right down.
I gotta go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
- Giving you the ATA therapy?
- Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember, it's only effective in 47 percent of those who receive it.
Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue Jell-O.
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper 1, this is Flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
" Go for launch. " That's so exciting.
Thanks, Rodney.
All right, here goes.
- I'll take it from here.
- What...?
Wait.
You're supposed to be in jail.
- Carson.
- Save your breath.
Your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No.
No, but, Carson...
- We're supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn't give you the ATA gene.
What?
It's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face-to-face conversation you wanted us to have.
The only thing that'll happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
Okay, I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait.
They're taking off.
It worked.
He's flying it.
Fly, Lucius, fly.
- Where are you taking me?
- Little vacation.
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe I'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, colonel, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much...
After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius'homecoming?
Well, they didn't kill him although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
If they haven't strung him up first.
The townspeople are over their withdrawal.
I doubt that'll happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I'd track him down hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us, thank you.
All right, all right.
Anyway, I better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
Subtitles by SDI Media Group
[ENGLISH]
Are you all right, colonel ?
It's nothing, just a cold.
No big deal.
Just annoying.
- Talk about annoying...
- What ?
We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
Identifying space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of a backwater hamlet.
- Are you that eager to return to Earth ?
- This isn't about me.
It's the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.
- And whenever I want to.
- How's that work, again ?
Okay.
Once we've seeded enough stargates between Pegasus and the Milky Way we'Il take a Jumper from one to the other till we reach the other side.
We won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus.
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs and get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
We should probably go.
Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, when you're right, you're right.
- We're here now--
Hello.
Hello, new people.
Why didn't anybody tell me they were here yet ?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Willa, I was just out for a walk.
- Have you met the new people yet ?
- We just got here.
Oh, great.
Then I haven't missed anything. I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife Willa ?
Isn't she gorgeous ?
My other wives, they're just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.
I love you. I love you.
Fair day, everybody.
Fair day, Lucius.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla.
- And you are from. . ?
- Athos.
Athos.
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
Sounds nice.
Is it nice ?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, have lunch, talk about this ?
Maybe have some wine ?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius ?
Well, everyone knows.
He's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh, people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right ?
Well, then, Lucius we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch, huh ?
Everybody has to eat.
Come on.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Fair day.
Fair day.
- Fair day.
Here I come.
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really...
- ... but hasn't stopped me from trying.
- l see.
- Is she taken yet ?
- No.
Nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
Yeah, I love a woman with spirit.
And a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius.
Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners.
- What is it about you-- ?
- l know so you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those gifts ?
Exploration.
Alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that just like that.
- It's just a cold.
- Nevertheless.
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
- That's impressive.
- You get used to it.
We'Il do a trade.
So where y'all from ?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, I saw it. I was on a walk.
I look up and I heard-
- Somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring ?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly ?
- It's complicated.
One has to--
- Where do you get a machine like that ?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one ?
Are they hard to fly ?
Yes, they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Well, perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines ?
- Or perhaps not.
- What ?
You come all this way you don't even wanna do a trade ?
Doesn't have to be the ship.
I don't want it.
You gotta have some other stuff to trade.
Okay, like, how do you get your hair to go like that ?
Lunch was great, but I just realized we're running late.
- For what ?
- For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we'd love to stay, we really must go.
No. I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
We haven't had the second course.
Please, I want you to see my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
- Another time, Lucius.
We gotta go.
- No.
No, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right ?
Tell you what.
Soon as we get back, we'Il tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer, then we'Il talk about trade.
- Later today, maybe ?
- Maybe.
- l'Il have everything ready.
- Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Nice people.
- l think the word we're looking for is--
- Obnoxious ?
Unctuous ?
Either one of those works.
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might be worth having Beckett check out.
I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer soon.
- So it's back out to scout for gates ?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
- Every single one ?
- Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- l see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say," ou " ?
Thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man. "
Young, old, women.
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett ?
What ?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up, just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean...
- ... when I say " be with you, " right ?
- l think so, yes.
I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit ?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember ?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway, huh ?
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go ?
Well, we found an unused gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota ?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything ?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
You know, I was a kid myself.
I take the baby and I open my coat and I tuck the baby inside.
And I start stroking the baby's back.
Gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again but beat it did.
And a cry arose piercing the cold night air as if to say " ou " ?
I am alive. "
Astonishing.
And that baby...
That baby grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain-damaged, but just a little, but the story is true.
And thank you for sharing it with me.
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most :
To share.
To share me.
And I can see that now.
You see ?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson--
- May I call you Carson ?
- Of course.
This city that you keep going on and on about--
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three--
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is ?
- Oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those ?
You mean the Jumpers ?
We have several.
Oh, yeah.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Ach, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my !
When you said this place was a 10 I thought," ou " ?
Okay, maybe it's an eight and a half, " but this...
- Carson ?
- Oh, Dr. Weir permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning...
You never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
- l didn't think you'd mind.
- You didn't think I'd mind ?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
This the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week ?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
- Really ?
That guy ?
- Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds ?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right ?
What do you mean ?
- It's just, you're acting a little...
- Smitten ?
I had another word in mind.
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger without prior approval.
Now he knows about the city, as well as our gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace.
As our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat ?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value.
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could have my personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know I'Il take a look at what you have, if you insist but this'Il do fine for now.
Oh, good. I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that--
What ?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
Well, I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
Oh, Lucius.
Just give them a chance to get to know you.
- Well, I just hope I get that chance.
- Oh, you will, I promise.
I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really ?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Hello. I was gonna go get something to eat.
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk ?
Guests are not permitted to move about unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me, then ?
- You don't like me yet, do you ?
- Yet ?
I'm sorry.
My manners fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
- Isn't she something, huh ?
- Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit all alone.
Please ?
- We'Il both take you.
Both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'Il get to know each other, then, okay ?
Like, how do you get your hair to go like that ?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine. I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol, endangering--
And for that, I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally ?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my home world topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.
What are you doing ?
I was told that you'd like to negotiate an alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance ?
Okay.
Sure.
That's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then, why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us ?
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet ?
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka ?
- Well, he's not here.
- No.
No one's here.
Where is everyone ?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran. I ran. I ran.
And, mind you, I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay ?
So here's what I do.
Okay.
I'm standing there and I'm running and I see the beast just coming towards me so I just step to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me I take my sword, I draw it and I lop off its head.
And-
- Yeah.
And I bend over, I pick it up and I walk in triumph back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my giant friend, I did, and let me tell you this :
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night.
If you know what I mean.
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on ?
What do you mean ?
What do I mean ?
We leave for a few hours and Lucius turns you all into Stepford wives.
What did he do to you ?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
Herbs and gourds ?
Please.
The medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
The ointment is worth something ?
- l haven't actually tested it.
- You're taking his word for it ?
- You got a problem with that ?
- Me ?
No.
He might.
Teyla, this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know. I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence ?
Not yet but he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah.
Reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit--
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really ?
- Yeah.
You didn't know that ?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and...
Surveillance footage from his quarters.
- What's this ?
- l took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid in the vial.
It'Il take some time to break it down.
I could have used Carson's help on this, but--
He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you fly to a planet, you take the gate, you fly away.
We try to take stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet and then, only if the planet is uninhabited.
It wouldn't be right to take a gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I've heard of this planet.
- You have ?
- Yeah, I have and I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two B's.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the gate-harvesting program.
- Yeah, I heard.
- And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
- No.
Really ?
- Has your intel been verified ?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
Not gonna send a team down there when there's still plenty of gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what ?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons you could easily dispose of a tiny Wraith outpost, if there even is one.
But ultimately is it worth the risk ?
No matter how small that risk may be.
- Sure, people may label you a coward--
- Will you knock it off ?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No. I won't allow it.
John, are you questioning my authority ?
Yeah, when it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
He's really a good man.
I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Élizabeth wants to send a team to check out a gate...
- ... at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts ?
Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
Haven't you noticed ?
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.
I'm working on it, but there's not enough liquid.
- l need more.
- l'Il go back to Lucius'village.
- l'm sure he keeps a stash.
- You're leaving me here alone ?
You said you need the liquid.
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody's gotta stay.
Keep away from the nuts.
Disable the DHD as soon as I'm gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay ?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard.
- Are you all right ?
- Where is he ?
- Lucius ?
- Did you take him ?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him ?
No, but one day as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people he told me a story, a wonderful wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that ?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once and since he is gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink, like, a liquid from a small vial ?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more ?
- l could bring it to him.
- We both can.
I can handle it.
Well, if we get you some, will you bring him home ?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
I did. I jumped in. I jump in the marsh and I'm looking at four of them. I know, I mean, four of them there...
- ... and I don't know which one to save.
- What did you do ?
And the next day, she became my wife.
My fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel.
That's what you are.
Come here.
You gotta hear this.
Lucius was telling the most hysterical story.
You know they have marmots on his planet ?
They're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent similar--
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down--
Ronon held me against the wall.
- -and Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
- Oh, you did ?
- And let me tell you we have nothing to worry about.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead ?
Where's Élizabeth ?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What ?
- l don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- l told you--
- Disable the DHD, I know.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
But come on Ronon and Teyla can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett ?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay.
We don't know for sure that there are Wraith on the planet.
We'Il find out soon enough, won't we ?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett.
We're coming in hot.
- You all right ?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me ?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react ?
Well, firstly, they volunteered.
And secondly, we got the herb.
Carson, I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
- You will ?
- Yes, I will.
You sent them to get an herb ?
We wanted to go.
Okay. I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on earth is wrong with you, John ?
We were just helping a friend.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what ?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
What does this do ?
That engages the HUD, Heads Up Display.
Heads up. I love that.
It gives me information when flying the Jumper :
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing ?
- l can fly it too.
- Yes.
Now that you received the ATA therapy, which I invented.
I was born with a gene which makes me more proficient...
- ... at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn't fly any better.
- Don't you lie--
- All right, all right.
Boys stop fighting.
A gene, you say ?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to use it.
Really ?
A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh ?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting.
If you look at this here...
Doc ?
Could I speak with you for a sec ?
Excuse me.
I think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you ?
Once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind--
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening ?
Jumper 3's starting up.
Who's in it ?
- l don't know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What-- ?
Why-- ?
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen ?
- Never.
We have strict flight protocol--
- He'd have to have a key--
- A security officer saw Sheppard carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay before the Jumper took off.
- So it was them in the flying machine ?
- My computer's missing.
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- l told you that man was dangerous.
I have to say, I am very disappointed right now.
I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
I want them found.
Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it now but what you're going through is kind of like a detox.
Now, according to research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone and then there's something about gamma activity in the " prefrontral cortrex. "
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See ?
That's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them easy to influence.
The longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality ?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish.
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of an extract made from the herb you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected ?
My cold. I can hardly breathe.
Plus, I haven't been around him much.
Look.
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere till the pheromone wore off but the people back on his planet are starting to get sick.
It looks like they're gonna get worse.
I don't want to...
- ... put our people through that.
- You're doing it to me right now.
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's gotta be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is worried.
- You think he's worried ?
- Jumper 2, report.
We're reading several life signs.
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We'Il check them.
- Lucius worried about us ?
- Lucius ?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it ?
Don't move.
- That thing's set to stun, right ?
- Yeah.
Good.
Carson, are you all right ?
I will be, once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for ?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Élizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discovery, but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How'd you get by before that ?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread-- l like to experiment.
- -and I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became like.
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where l could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Then we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate.
And everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just wanna help me all the time.
What's wrong with that ?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything...
- ... they didn't wanna do.
- Six wives.
Sometimes all at once.
When you get over this cold, we're gonna have a long chat.
Face to face.
And I got a feeling we're gonna become the best of friends.
And you're gonna wanna help me too, all the time.
And you'Il love it.
Just a warning, Lucius.
You get too close to me, it'Il be the last thing you do.
That's all right, colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius ?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
-I've finished preparing the inoculation.
- All right, I'Il be right down.
I gotta go get an inoculation.
We'Il talk after.
- Giving you the ATA therapy ?
- Yeah.
Isn't that great ?
There.
All done.
Now, remember, it's only effective in 47 percent of those who receive it.
Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you okay ?
Can I get you anything ?
No, Rodney. I'm fine.
- You sure ?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue Jell-O.
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper 1, this is Flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
" Go for launch. " That's so exciting.
Thanks, Rodney.
All right, here goes.
- l'Il take it from here.
- What-- ?
Wait.
You're supposed to be in jail.
- Carson.
- Save your breath.
Your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No.
No, but, Carson...
- We're supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn't give you the ATA gene.
What ?
It's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face-to-face conversation you wanted us to have.
The only thing that'Il happen is you'Il catch my cold.
What is taking him so long ?
Okay, I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait.
They're taking off.
It worked.
He's flying it.
Fly, Lucius, fly.
- Where are you taking me ?
- Little vacation.
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to my people without you interfering.
And then what ?
Then maybe I'Il take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me ?
Without even being under the effect of the herb ?
- After all I did ?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, colonel, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much--
After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius'homecoming ?
Well, they didn't kill him although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
If they haven't strung him up first.
The townspeople are over their withdrawal. I doubt that'Il happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I'd track him down...
- ... hang him by his feet and cut off his--
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here back to normal ?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires ?
Secret longings for his touch ?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us, thank you.
All right, all right.
Anyway, I better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
[ENGLISH]
Are you all right, colonel?
It's nothing, just a cold.
No big deal.
Just annoying.
- Talk about annoying....
- What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney.
The M.A.L.P. detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
Identifying space gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of a backwater hamlet.
- Are you that eager to return to Earth?
- This isn't about me.
It's the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently.
- And whenever I want to.
- How's that work, again?
Okay.
Once we've seeded enough stargates between Pegasus and the Milky Way we'll take a Jumper from one to the other till we reach the other side.
We won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus.
Travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet, dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs and get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
We should probably go.
Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, when you're right, you're right.
- We're here now-
Hello.
Hello, new people.
Why didn't anybody tell me they were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Willa, I was just out for a walk.
- Have you met the new people yet?
- We just got here.
Oh, great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives, they're just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Fair day, everybody.
Fair day, Lucius.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex, Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla.
- And you are from...?
- Athos.
Athos.
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
Sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, have lunch, talk about this?
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows.
He's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh, people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then, Lucius we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch, huh?
Everybody has to eat.
Come on.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
- Fair day.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Fair day.
Fair day.
- Fair day.
Here I come.
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really...
- ...but hasn't stopped me from trying.
- I see.
- Is she taken yet?
- No.
Nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
Yeah, I love a woman with spirit.
And a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius.
Please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners.
- What is it about you-?
- I know so you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those gifts?
Exploration.
Alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that just like that.
- It's just a cold.
- Nevertheless.
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
- That's impressive.
- You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So where y'all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk.
I look up and I heard
- Somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to-
- Where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes, they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Well, perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
- Or perhaps not.
- What?
You come all this way you don't even wanna do a trade?
Doesn't have to be the ship.
I don't want it.
You gotta have some other stuff to trade.
Okay, like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great, but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
- For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we'd love to stay, we really must go.
No.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
We haven't had the second course.
Please, I want you to see my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
- Another time, Lucius.
We gotta go.
- No.
No, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what.
Soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer, then we'll talk about trade.
- Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
You won't be disappointed.
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is-
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
The townspeople seem to love him.
There may be something to his medicine.
Sounds like snake oil to me, but might be worth having Beckett check out.
I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer soon.
- So it's back out to scout for gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
- Every single one?
- Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, " Thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man."
Young, old, women.
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up, just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean...
- ...when I say " be with you," right?
- I think so, yes.
I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway, huh?
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well, we found an unused gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
You know, I was a kid myself.
I take the baby and I open my coat and I tuck the baby inside.
And I start stroking the baby's back.
Gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again but beat it did.
And a cry arose piercing the cold night air as if to say "I am alive."
Astonishing.
And that baby....
That baby grew up to be....
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain-damaged, but just a little, but the story is true.
And thank you for sharing it with me.
Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most:
To share.
To share me.
And I can see that now.
You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson-
- May I call you Carson?
- Of course.
This city that you keep going on and on about-
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three-
Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is?
- Oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
We have several.
Oh, yeah.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Ach, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my!
When you said this place was a 10 I thought, " Okay, maybe it's an eight and a half," but this....
- Carson?
- Oh, Dr. Weir permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning....
You never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
- I didn't think you'd mind.
- You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
This the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
- Really?
That guy?
- Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney, gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
- It's just, you're acting a little....
- Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
- This is not something to treat lightly.
- No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger without prior approval.
Now he knows about the city, as well as our gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace.
As our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value.
Just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could have my personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know I'll take a look at what you have, if you insist but this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that-
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
Well, I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
Oh, Lucius.
Just give them a chance to get to know you.
- Well, I just hope I get that chance.
- Oh, you will, I promise.
I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Hello.
I was gonna go get something to eat.
They forgot to bring me something.
Are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me, then?
- You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
I'm sorry.
My manners fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
- Isn't she something, huh?
- Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit all alone.
Please?
- We'll both take you.
Both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other, then, okay?
Like, how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol, endangering-
And for that, I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my home world topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
- Please, have a seat.
- After you.
What are you doing?
I was told that you'd like to negotiate an alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
That's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then, why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us?
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet?
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
- Well, he's not here.
- No.
No one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran.
I ran.
And, mind you, I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do.
Okay.
I'm standing there and I'm running and I see the beast just coming towards me so I just step to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me I take my sword, I draw it and I lop off its head.
And
- Yeah.
And I bend over, I pick it up and I walk in triumph back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my giant friend, I did, and let me tell you this:
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night.
If you know what I mean.
- Repeatedly.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours and Lucius turns you all into Stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
Herbs and gourds?
Please.
The medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
The ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- You're taking his word for it?
- You got a problem with that?
- Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla, this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet but he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah.
Reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
Julie Newmar in the cat outfit-
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and....
Surveillance footage from his quarters.
- What's this?
- I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
I could have used Carson's help on this, but-
He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you fly to a planet, you take the gate, you fly away.
We try to take stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet and then, only if the planet is uninhabited.
It wouldn't be right to take a gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I've heard of this planet.
- You have?
- Yeah, I have and I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two B's.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the gate-harvesting program.
- Yeah, I heard.
- And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
- No.
Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
Not gonna send a team down there when there's still plenty of gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong.
With your advanced weapons you could easily dispose of a tiny Wraith outpost, if there even is one.
But ultimately is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
- Sure, people may label you a coward-
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John, are you questioning my authority?
Yeah, when it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
He's really a good man.
I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Elizabeth wants to send a team to check out a gate...
- ...at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- Is she nuts?
Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
- We need to figure out why.
I'm working on it, but there's not enough liquid.
- I need more.
- I'll go back to Lucius' village.
- I'm sure he keeps a stash.
- You're leaving me here alone?
You said you need the liquid.
- The place is turning into a nuthouse.
- Somebody's gotta stay.
Keep away from the nuts.
Disable the DHD as soon as I'm gone.
Prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard.
- Are you all right?
- Where is he?
- Lucius?
- Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people he told me a story, a wonderful wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once and since he is gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink, like, a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
- I could bring it to him.
- We both can.
I can handle it.
Well, if we get you some, will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
I did.
I jumped in.
I jump in the marsh and I'm looking at four of them.
I know, I mean, four of them there...
- ...and I don't know which one to save.
- What did you do?
And the next day, she became my wife.
My fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel.
That's what you are.
Come here.
You gotta hear this.
Lucius was telling the most hysterical story.
You know they have marmots on his planet?
They're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent similar-
- You said you were gonna stay away.
- Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down-
Ronon held me against the wall.
- And Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
- Oh, you did?
- And let me tell you we have nothing to worry about.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Elizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
- We thought that you were them.
- Teyla, Ronon, Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you-
- Disable the DHD, I know.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
But come on Ronon and Teyla can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
- Now, he can walk on his hands.
He showed Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands....
McKay.
We don't know for sure that there are Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett.
We're coming in hot.
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
Well, firstly, they volunteered.
And secondly, we got the herb.
Carson, I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
- You will?
- Yes, I will.
You sent them to get an herb?
We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
What does this do?
That engages the HUD, Heads Up Display.
Heads up.
I love that.
It gives me information when flying the Jumper:
- Navigation, weapons.
- You fly this thing?
- I can fly it too.
- Yes.
Now that you received the ATA therapy, which I invented.
I was born with a gene which makes me more proficient...
- ...at operating Ancient technology.
- He doesn't fly any better.
- Don't you lie-
- All right, all right.
Boys stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to use it.
Really?
A gene.
Just an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting.
If you look at this here....
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
Once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind-
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper 3's starting up.
Who's in it?
- I don't know.
- Jumper 3, please identify.
Jumper 3, this is Flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What-?
Why-?
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- Never.
We have strict flight protocol-
- He'd have to have a key-
- A security officer saw Sheppard carrying Beckett to the Jumper bay before the Jumper took off.
- So it was them in the flying machine?
- My computer's missing.
- A tablet, two drives, all my research.
- I told you that man was dangerous.
I have to say, I am very disappointed right now.
I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
I want them found.
Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it now but what you're going through is kind of like a detox.
Now, according to research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone and then there's something about gamma activity in the " prefrontral cortrex."
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See?
That's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone in close proximity, it makes them easy to influence.
The longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish.
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of an extract made from the herb you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus, I haven't been around him much.
Look.
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere till the pheromone wore off but the people back on his planet are starting to get sick.
It looks like they're gonna get worse.
I don't want to...
- ...put our people through that.
- You're doing it to me right now.
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's gotta be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is worried.
- You think he's worried?
- Jumper 2, report.
We're reading several life signs.
They might be Athosian hunting parties.
We'll check them.
- Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
- That thing's set to stun, right?
- Yeah.
Good.
Carson, are you all right?
I will be, once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Elizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So that herb of yours....
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discovery, but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How'd you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread- I like to experiment.
- And I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became like.
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Then we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate.
And everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just wanna help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything...
- ...they didn't wanna do.
- Six wives.
Sometimes all at once.
When you get over this cold, we're gonna have a long chat.
Face to face.
And I got a feeling we're gonna become the best of friends.
And you're gonna wanna help me too, all the time.
And you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius.
You get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
- I've finished preparing the inoculation.
- All right, I'll be right down.
I gotta go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
- Giving you the ATA therapy?
- Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember, it's only effective in 47 percent of those who receive it.
Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue Jell-O.
- Just a little bit of whipped cream.
- Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper 1, this is Flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
"Go for launch." That's so exciting.
Thanks, Rodney.
All right, here goes.
- I'll take it from here.
- What-?
Wait.
You're supposed to be in jail.
- Carson.
- Save your breath.
Your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No.
No, but, Carson....
- We're supposed to be best of friends.
- Carson didn't give you the ATA gene.
What?
It's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face-to-face conversation you wanted us to have.
The only thing that'll happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
Okay, I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait.
They're taking off.
It worked.
He's flying it.
Fly, Lucius, fly.
- Where are you taking me?
- Little vacation.
Time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe I'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, colonel, I can't thank you enough.
Thank you so much-
After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius' homecoming?
Well, they didn't kill him although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
If they haven't strung him up first.
The townspeople are over their withdrawal.
I doubt that'll happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I'd track him down...
- ...hang him by his feet and cut off his-
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us, thank you.
All right, all right.
Anyway, I better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
Are you all right, Colonel?
It's nothing.
Just a cold.
No big deal.
It's just annoying.
Talk about annoying.
What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space Gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney, but the MALP detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
I'm just saying that identifying potential space Gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of some backwater hamlet.
Are you that eager to return to Earth, Rodney?
This isn't just about me.
It is about the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently... and whenever I want to.
- How's that work again?
- Okay... once we've seeded enough Stargates across the void between Pegasus and the Milky Way, we'll be able to take a Jumper from one to the other to the other, till we reach the other side.
That way, we won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus, and travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs, and... get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
- We should probably go.
- Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, no, when you're right, you're right.
- No, we're here now...
Hello!
Hello, new people!
Why didn't anybody tell me the new people were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Oh, please.
Well, I was just out for a walk.
Have you met the new people yet?
We just got here.
Oh, great.
Great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife, Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives are just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello, sweetheart.
I love ya.
I love ya.
- Fair day, everybody.
- Fair day Lucius.
Fair day.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex.
Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla... and you are from...
- Athos.
- Athos...
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
It sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, we have some lunch, we talk about this...
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows... he's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then...
Lucius... we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch...
Everybody has to eat, right come one.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
Fair day.
Fair day, Lucius.
Fair day.
Fair day.
Here I come!
Season 3, Episode 3 Irresistible
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really, but... it hasn't stopped me from trying.
I see.
Is she taken yet?
No... nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
I love a woman with spirit... and a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius, please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners, but
- what is it exactly about you...
- I know what you're going to say.
So you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those... gifts?
Exploration, alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that, just...
- just like that.
- It's just a cold.
Nevertheless,
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
That's impressive.
You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So... where are you all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine of yours.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk, I look up... and I heard and somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- I mean, where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes... they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Or perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
Or perhaps not.
What, you come all this way, you don't even want to do a trade?
Look, it doesn't have to be the ship.
Forget the ship.
I don't even want the ship, okay?
You've got to have some other stuff that you want to trade, right?
Okay like... how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great,
- but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we would love to stay, we really must go.
No, no, no.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
Come on, come on.
We haven't even had the second course.
Please!
I want you to see some of my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
Another time, Lucius.
We've got to go.
No... no, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what...
soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer.
Then we'll talk about trade.
Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
- You won't be disappointed!
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
Then again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicine.
Sounds like a snake oil salesman to me, but it might be worth having Beckett check it out.
Well, I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer pretty quickly.
- So it's back out to scout for Gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet on my walks, but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess,
I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
Every single one?
Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, "thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man".
Young, old... women...
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up around the square just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say "be with you", right?
- I think so, yes.
- I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid
I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway...
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well... we found an unused Gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy Gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair anyway, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest Gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay a little longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know, what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
I was a kid myself.
I take the baby, and I open my coat, and I tuck the baby inside, and I start stroking the baby's back, gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again,
but beat it did... and a cry arose, piercing the cold night air, as if to say...
I... am... alive.
Astonishing.
And that baby... that baby... grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain damage, but just a little, but the story is true.
- And thank you for sharing it with me.
- Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most... to share.
To share me.
- And I can see that now.
- You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- may I call you Carson?
- Of course you can.
Carson, this City that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
- Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is... oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
Oh, aye, we have several.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Look, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my.
When you said this place was a ten, I thought, "okay, maybe... maybe it's an eight and a half,"
but this...
Carson?
Dr. Weir... permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning... you never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
Is this the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
Really?
That guy?
Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney.
Gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
It's just you're acting... a little...
Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
This is not something to treat lightly.
No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger to Atlantis without prior approval.
Now he knows about the City, as well as our Gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace, as our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value to us.
We'll just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out to scout more Gates.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could always have my own personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know, I'll take a look at what you have if you insist, but... this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
Oh, I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
- Lucius just give them a chance to get to know you.
- I just hope I get that chance.
Oh, you will, I promise.
In fact, I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Oh, hello.
I was going to go get something to eat, because they forgot to bring me something, so... are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about the City unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me then?
You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
- I'm sorry.
My manners just fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
Isn't she something?
Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no, no.
Come on.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit in there all alone.
Come on, please?
- Very well.
We will both take you.
Oh, both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other then, okay.
Like how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems... excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol,
- endangering...
- and for that I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
- It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
- No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my homeworld, topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
Please, have a seat.
After you.
What are you doing?
I've been told that you would like to negotiate a possible alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
I mean, that's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then... why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us.
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet.
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their Gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
Well, he's not here.
No, no one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran!
I ran and I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do, okay.
Here's what I do.
Okay, I'm standing there, and I'm running, and I see the beast, just coming towards me, so I just stepped to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me,
I take my sword,
I draw it, and I lop off its head.
Yeah, and I bend over, I pick it up, and I walk in triumph... back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my dear, oh my giant friend,
I did, and let me tell you this...
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night, if you know what I mean.
"He's such a dandy!"
Repeatedly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on here?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours, and Lucius turns you all into stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
- Herbs and gourds?
- Please, the medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
You're really telling me the ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- Oh, you're just taking his word for it?
You got a problem with that?
Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla... this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy, and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet, but... he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah, reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
This Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman, make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
- Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and... surveillance footage from his quarters.
What's this?
I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid still in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
- I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
- He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you just fly to a planet, you take the Gate, you fly away.
Well, we try to take Stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet, and then only if the planet is uninhabited.
Obviously, it wouldn't be right to take a Gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I think I've heard of this planet.
You have?
Yeah, I have.
And I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I've got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the Gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two Bs.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the Gate harvesting program.
Yeah, I heard.
And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that, too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
No.
- Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
I'm not going to send a team down there, not when there's still plenty of Gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong... with all your advanced weapons, you could easily dispose of a tiny wraith outpost, if there even is an outpost, but ultimately, is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
I mean, sure,
- people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John... are you questioning my authority?
When it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that Gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
- He's really a good man.
- I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Elizabeth wants to send a team to check out a Gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- What is she, nuts?
- Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
- Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
You need to figure out why without drawing too much attention.
I am working on it, but there's not enough of the liquid to work with.
I need more.
I'll go back to Lucius's village.
I'm sure he keeps a stash there.
I'll just grab some.
You're leaving me here alone?
- You said you need the liquid.
- Yeah, but the place is turning into a nuthouse.
Somebody's got to stay.
Just keep away from the nuts.
And you've got to disable the DHD as soon a I'm gone to prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard!
Are you all right?
Where is he?
Lucius?
Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day, as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people, he told me a story, a wonderful, wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward, we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once, and since he has gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink a... a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
I could bring it to him.
We both can.
I can handle it.
If we get you some... will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
And the next day she became my wife, my fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel, you know that's what you are.
Sheppard, come here.
You've got to hear this.
Lucius was just telling the most hysterical story.
Do you know that they have marmots on his planet?
Well, they're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent very similar to...
I thought you said you were gonna stay away from the nuts.
Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself, but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down,
Ronon held me against the wall, and Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
Oh, you did.
And let me tell you, we have nothing to worry about with this guy.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Elizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
We thought that you were them.
Teyla, Ronon, and Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- To disable the DHD.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I didn't.
But come on.
- Ronon and Teyla.
I mean, they can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
Well, he... now, he can walk on his hands.
Did you know that?
He was showing Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay!
We don't know for sure that there are even Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, though, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett!
We're coming in hot!
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
- Well, firstly, they volunteered.
- And secondly... we got the herb.
Carson,
I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
You will?
Yes, I will.
- You sent them to get an herb?
- We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on Earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend... and there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
So, what does this do?
That engages the HUD.
Stands for "heads up display".
Heads up...
I love that.
It gives me whatever information I need when flying the Jumper.
Navigation, weapons...
- You can fly this?
- I can fly it, too.
Yes, now that you received the A.T.A. Therapy, which I invented.
I was actually born with the gene, which makes me much more proficient at operating ancient technology.
It does not.
He doesn't fly this thing any better than I do.
Don't you lie to Lucius...
All right... boys, stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone such as me to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to be able to use some of it as well.
Really?
A gene, huh?
You said an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting...
if you look at this down here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I... think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
You see, once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper three is starting up.
Who's in it?
I don't know.
Jumper three, please identify.
Jumper three, this is flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...
Why...
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- This has never happened before.
- You know, we have very, very strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key or something...
A security officer saw Colonel Sheppard carrying Dr. Beckett toward the Jumper bay moments before the Jumper took off.
So it was them in the flying machine?
My computer's missing.
A tablet, two drives, all of my research.
I told you that man was dangerous.
- I have to say, Liz, I am very disappointed right now.
- I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
- I want them found.
- Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it right now, but what you're going through is kind of like a... a detox.
Now, according to the research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club, that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone, and then there's something about gamma activity in the prefrontral cortrex.
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See, that's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone, in close proximity, it makes them... easy to influence, and the longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish!
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of extract made from the herb that you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus...
I haven't been around him much.
Look...
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere until the pheromone wore off, but the people back on his home planet are starting to get sick, and it looks like they're going to get worse before they get better.
I don't want to put our people through that.
You're doing it to me right now!
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's got to be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is probably worried.
You think he's worried?
Jumper two, report.
We're reading several life signs, but they might be Athosian hunting parties, we're going to go check them out.
- Is Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
That thing is set to stun, right?
Yeah.
Good.
Carson are you all right?
I will be once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, Colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Elizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So... that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discover but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How did you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment... and I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became "like".
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Until we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate... and everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just want to help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't want to do.
Six wives?
Sometimes all at once.
You know, when you get over this cold, you and I are going to have a long chat, face to face, and I've got a feeling we're going to become the best of friends,
and you're going to want to help me, too all the time, and you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius... you get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, Colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
I've finished preparing the inoculation.
All right, I'll be right down.
I've got to go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
He's giving you the A.T.A. therapy?
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember,
- it's only effective in 47% of those who receive it.
- Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you feeling okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would be no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue jello.
Just a little bit of whipped cream.
Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper one, this is flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
"Go for launch".
That's so exciting.
Thanks Rodney.
All right, here goes.
I'll take it from here.
You're supposed to be in jail.
Carson.
Save your breath, your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No... no, but...
Carson... we're supposed to be best of friends.
Carson didn't give you the A.T.A. gene.
What?
I'm afraid it's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face to face conversation you always wanted us to have.
The only thing that will happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait!
They're taking off.
It worked!
He's flying it.
"He flies.
He flies so beautifully!"
Fly, Lucius, fly.
Where are you taking me?
Little vacation.
Just enough time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to the rest of my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe i'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, Colonel, I can't thank you enough.
- Thank you so much...
- After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius' homecoming?
Well... they didn't kill him, although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
That's if they haven't strung him up first.
Well, the townspeople are over their withdrawal and on the mend, so I doubt that will happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I would track him down,
- hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here... back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us thank you.
All right, all right.
Hey, buddy, I'd better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste, for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
Are you all right, Colonel?
It's nothing.
Just a cold.
No big deal.
It's just annoying.
Talk about annoying.
What?
We should be focusing on harvesting space Gates.
That's what we're doing, Rodney, but the MALP detected life signs.
We have to check it out.
That's the protocol.
I'm just saying that identifying potential space Gates to complete the intergalactic bridge should be our priority, not making contact with the locals of some backwater hamlet.
Are you that eager to return to Earth, Rodney?
This isn't just about me.
It is about the ability to go back and forth between Earth and Atlantis conveniently... and whenever I want to.
- How's that work again?
- Okay... once we've seeded enough Stargates across the void between Pegasus and the Milky Way, we'll be able to take a Jumper from one to the other to the other, till we reach the other side.
That way, we won't tax the ZPM, we won't be reliant on the Daedalus, and travel time between Earth and Atlantis will be cut from three weeks to 30 minutes.
- Very clever.
- Yes.
It was Samantha Carter's idea.
Backwater hamlet dead ahead.
Okay, let's just make contact, buy our souvenirs, and... get out of here.
Fair day to you.
Fair day to you.
Nothing here.
- We should probably go.
- Yeah, probably wouldn't hurt to make contact with the locals, though.
- No, no, when you're right, you're right.
- No, we're here now...
Hello!
Hello, new people!
Why didn't anybody tell me the new people were here yet?
- Lucius, I've missed you.
- Oh, please.
Well, I was just out for a walk.
Have you met the new people yet?
We just got here.
Oh, great.
Great.
Then I haven't missed anything.
I hate missing things.
Have you met my wife, Willa?
Isn't she gorgeous?
My other wives are just making lunch.
- Fair day, Lucius.
- Hello, sweetheart.
I love ya.
I love ya.
- Fair day, everybody.
- Fair day Lucius.
Fair day.
I'm John Sheppard.
Rodney McKay.
Ronon Dex.
Teyla Emmagan.
Teyla... and you are from...
- Athos.
- Athos...
Yeah, Athos.
I've never been there.
It sounds nice.
Is it nice?
Until it was culled by the Wraith.
Oh, I hate them.
What do you say you and me get together, we have some lunch, we talk about this...
Maybe have some wine?
We don't even know your name.
We're serious.
You mean you truly have not heard of Lucius?
Well, everyone knows... he's the wisest and kindest man among the stars.
Oh people just say that.
I mean, you can't prove it till you've met everybody, am I right?
Well, then...
Lucius... we're glad we met you.
And if you aren't yet, you will be.
Come on, let's have some lunch...
Everybody has to eat, right come one.
Right this way, please.
Please.
After you.
Please.
Fair day.
Fair day, Lucius.
Fair day.
Fair day.
Here I come!
Season 3, Episode 3 Irresistible
Transcript by Callie Sullivan / sadgeezer. com
I love architecture.
It's all a mystery to me, really, but... it hasn't stopped me from trying.
I see.
Is she taken yet?
No... nor does he, nor anyone else, speak for me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you are definitely wife material.
I love a woman with spirit... and a great body.
Excuse me, Lucius, please pardon my ignorance, possibly even my manners, but
- what is it exactly about you...
- I know what you're going to say.
So you don't even have to ask.
I have gifts.
What are those... gifts?
Exploration, alchemy, medicine.
I have, I have to say, some of the best ointments around.
See, I could take care of that, just...
- just like that.
- It's just a cold.
Nevertheless,
I have a potion that could get rid of that in six or seven days.
That's impressive.
You get used to it.
We'll do a trade.
So... where are you all from?
No place in particular.
We move around a lot.
In that wonderful machine of yours.
Yeah, I saw it.
I was on a walk, I look up... and I heard and somebody said that you flew through the ancestral ring?
Yeah, that was us.
How does it fly?
- It's complicated.
One has to...
- I mean, where do you get a machine like that?
I mean, it's a wonderful way to travel.
Can I get one?
Are they hard to fly?
Yes... they are hard to fly, and no, you can't have one.
But I want one.
Please.
Sorry.
Or perhaps a trade for some of his wonderful medicines?
Or perhaps not.
What, you come all this way, you don't even want to do a trade?
Look, it doesn't have to be the ship.
Forget the ship.
I don't even want the ship, okay?
You've got to have some other stuff that you want to trade, right?
Okay like... how do you get your hair to go like that?
Lunch was great,
- but I just realized we're running late.
- For what?
For that important thing.
Yes, as much as we would love to stay, we really must go.
No, no, no.
I don't want you to go.
You just got here.
Come on, come on.
We haven't even had the second course.
Please!
I want you to see some of my medicines.
Go get the ointments, the good ones.
Go.
Run.
Go.
Another time, Lucius.
We've got to go.
No... no, I don't want you to leave.
Okay, okay, okay.
All right.
Let them go.
We're all friends here, right?
Tell you what...
soon as we get back, we'll tell our medical people to come see what you have to offer.
Then we'll talk about trade.
Later today, maybe?
- Maybe.
- I'll have everything ready.
- Thank you.
- You won't be disappointed!
Nice people.
- I think the word we're looking for is...
- Obnoxious?
Unctuous?
Either one of those works.
Then again, the townspeople seem to love him, so maybe there's something to his medicine.
Sounds like a snake oil salesman to me, but it might be worth having Beckett check it out.
Well, I'm sure Carson will be able to get us an answer pretty quickly.
- So it's back out to scout for Gates?
- Yes.
Right away.
It's not a race, Rodney.
Some of the herbs were gathered from this planet on my walks, but most were collected from my many excursions to other worlds.
I have to confess,
I have concocted remedies for almost every known ailment.
Every single one?
Well, every one in town.
The sick have been cured.
The lame can walk again.
Well, some still crawl, but they crawl a lot faster than they used to.
- I see.
- Nothing pleases me more than when someone comes up to me, they say, "thank you, Lucius.
You have cured me.
You are a wise and kind man".
Young, old... women...
Do you like women, Dr. Beckett?
What?
Yes, of course.
Yeah, I have a potion that will have them lined up around the square just waiting to be with you.
You know what I mean when I say "be with you", right?
- I think so, yes.
- I will trade you that potion for what you are holding in your bag right now.
My medical kit?
I thought you cured every known ailment.
Every known ailment in town.
I added that, remember?
Well, it is tempting, but I'm afraid
I couldn't do that, Lucius.
Sorry.
Not yet, anyway...
Come on.
You must be starving.
I have a great meal lined up for us.
How did the scout go?
Well... we found an unused Gate in orbit over M3R-428.
One lousy Gate.
We're never gonna meet our quota at this rate.
- What quota?
- My quota.
Daedalus is still under repair anyway, Rodney.
We won't be able to harvest Gates till it can fly.
Did Beckett bring back anything worth anything?
No, he hasn't returned yet.
He radioed in earlier, said he'd like to stay a little longer.
Apparently he's found something of interest.
The baby was frozen solid.
Like a statue.
Like a frozen statue.
It must have been in the water for, I don't know, what seemed like an eternity.
I didn't know what to do.
I was a kid myself.
I take the baby, and I open my coat, and I tuck the baby inside, and I start stroking the baby's back, gently.
Now, I don't know whether it was the warmth of my body or the steady, insistent rhythm of my own life force urging this tiny baby's heart to begin beating again,
but beat it did... and a cry arose, piercing the cold night air, as if to say...
I... am... alive.
Astonishing.
And that baby... that baby... grew up to be...
That beautiful young lady.
No, no, not her, not her.
Behind her.
Maybe a little brain damage, but just a little, but the story is true.
- And thank you for sharing it with me.
- Oh, please, Dr. Beckett.
That's what I like doing most... to share.
To share me.
- And I can see that now.
- You see?
All you had to do was get to know me.
You know, Carson...
- may I call you Carson?
- Of course you can.
Carson, this City that you keep going on and on about...
- Atlantis.
- Yeah, Atlantis.
On a scale of one to 10, this village being a three...
- Oh, Atlantis is definitely a 10.
- It is... oh, yeah.
And those flying ships, you still have those?
You mean the Jumpers?
Oh, aye, we have several.
How interesting.
Tell me more.
Look, Lucius, I think I could do much better than that.
Incoming wormhole.
Opening the shield.
Dr. Beckett's IDC.
It's about time.
Carson.
Oh, my.
When you said this place was a ten, I thought, "okay, maybe... maybe it's an eight and a half,"
but this...
Carson?
Dr. Weir... permit me to introduce Lucius Luvin.
Speaking of stunning... you never told me anything about her.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I am definitely gonna like it here.
I can't believe you brought him here without permission.
I didn't think you'd mind.
You didn't think I'd mind?
You know the protocols.
You even helped come up with them.
There's so much he can offer us.
Is this the same guy who said he could cure my cold in a week?
I know my business, Colonel Sheppard.
He happens to have created several medicines that are quite remarkable.
Really?
That guy?
Aye.
He also possesses many valuable herbs and spices and gourds.
- Did you just say gourds?
- Yes, Rodney.
Gourds.
We don't know everything, despite what you may think.
He could prove to be a very powerful ally.
He's a very wise and kind man.
Are you feeling all right?
What do you mean?
It's just you're acting... a little...
Smitten?
I had another word in mind.
This is not something to treat lightly.
No, it isn't.
You've brought a stranger to Atlantis without prior approval.
Now he knows about the City, as well as our Gate address.
Lucius would do nothing to harm us.
He comes in peace, as our friend.
You have his word and mine on that.
- Do you think he poses a threat?
- Definitely a nuisance.
If what Beckett says is correct, these medicines could be of value to us.
We'll just keep an eye on him.
McKay and I are heading out to scout more Gates.
Tell Teyla and Ronon not to let him out of their sight.
Here we are.
It's perfect.
Because you could always have my own personal quarters if you wanted.
Oh, no, no.
Don't be silly, Carson.
I mean, you know, I'll take a look at what you have if you insist, but... this'll do fine for now.
Oh, good.
I'm so pleased.
Just let me know if you want anything.
Oh, I can't think of anything I want more than just being here.
Except that...
What?
- No, it's nothing.
- No, tell me.
I get the feeling that your friends don't like having me around.
- Lucius just give them a chance to get to know you.
- I just hope I get that chance.
Oh, you will, I promise.
In fact, I'm sure Dr. Weir will want to negotiate an alliance between your people and ours.
- Really?
- Really.
Oh, that'd be great.
Oh, hello.
I was going to go get something to eat, because they forgot to bring me something, so... are you guys not allowed to talk?
Guests are not permitted to move about the City unescorted.
Well, what do you say you escort me then?
You don't like me yet, do you?
- Yet?
- I'm sorry.
My manners just fail when I am in the presence of a beautiful woman.
Isn't she something?
Yeah.
- We will have something sent to you.
- Oh, no, no.
Come on.
Come on.
- Don't make me sit in there all alone.
Come on, please?
- Very well.
We will both take you.
Oh, both.
Both is good.
Yeah, we'll get to know each other then, okay.
Like how do you get your hair to go like that?
Just listen to what he has to say.
Thank you.
Fine.
I must say, I'm starting to get concerned about your interest in this man.
It seems... excessive.
And I find it puzzling why you've chosen to greet Lucius with such hostility.
Perhaps it's because you broke protocol,
- endangering...
- and for that I am sorry, but can we please move on past that one mistake and not further alienate a potential ally?
Fine.
Have him come up to my office.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Yeah.
Hello, Dr. Weir.
Thank you for granting me this audience.
- It's hardly that, Mr. Luvin.
- No, please.
Lucius.
May this be the first of many gifts that our people exchange.
Thank you.
I made it myself.
The gourd is from the marshes of my homeworld, topped with a candle that's made from the congealed tallow of an animal that I killed with my bare hands.
How nice.
It's nothing.
Please, have a seat.
After you.
What are you doing?
I've been told that you would like to negotiate a possible alliance between our two peoples.
An alliance?
Okay.
Sure.
I mean, that's why I'm here, is to talk about that.
Well, then... why don't you start by telling me what you have to offer us.
Besides candles.
Right.
One tiny settlement on the entire planet.
Look, all we'd have to do is relocate them.
We're not evacuating an entire planet so we can take their Gate.
Hey.
Welcome back.
Where's Zelenka?
Well, he's not here.
No, no one's here.
Where is everyone?
I'm standing outside.
I don't know what to do.
I ran.
I ran!
I ran and I'm the guy who's holding the weapon, okay?
So here's what I do, okay.
Here's what I do.
Okay, I'm standing there, and I'm running, and I see the beast, just coming towards me, so I just stepped to my left, I turn around, and just as he's coming to me,
I take my sword,
I draw it, and I lop off its head.
Yeah, and I bend over, I pick it up, and I walk in triumph... back to the village.
- Amazing.
- You didn't.
Oh, yes, my dear, oh my giant friend,
I did, and let me tell you this...
I had no trouble finding female companionship that night, if you know what I mean.
"He's such a dandy!"
Repeatedly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the hell is going on here?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
We leave for a few hours, and Lucius turns you all into stepford wives.
What did he do to you?
Absolutely nothing.
Carson was right about him.
I agree.
He has much to offer us.
- Herbs and gourds?
- Please, the medicines alone are worth whatever he asks.
You're really telling me the ointment is worth something?
- I haven't actually tested it.
- Oh, you're just taking his word for it?
You got a problem with that?
Me?
No.
He might.
Teyla... this is the man who asked you to be his seventh wife.
I know.
I hope I didn't upset him.
You just haven't taken the time to get to know Lucius.
Carson is right.
Again.
Look, I think he could be a great asset to us.
He has traveled extensively throughout this galaxy, and gathered a tremendous amount of intelligence.
Has he shared any of this intelligence?
Not yet, but... he did give me this.
A very wise and kind man.
This is creeping me out.
Yeah, reminds me of an old Batman episode, actually.
This Catwoman used a drug to put a spell on Batman, make him fall in love with her.
Ended up doing all sorts of evil things for her.
Kind of a turn-on, actually.
- Julie Newmar in the cat outfit...
- Eartha Kitt was Catwoman.
- Not till season three.
- Really?
Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Oh, so anyway, I did a little investigating, and... surveillance footage from his quarters.
What's this?
I took the liberty of searching his room.
There's some residue from the liquid still in the vial.
It'll take some time to break it down.
- I could have used Carson's help on this, but...
- He's off picking daffodils for his new friend.
Right.
That's brilliant.
This is actually how we found your planet.
So you just fly to a planet, you take the Gate, you fly away.
Well, we try to take Stargates that are in fixed orbit around a planet, and then only if the planet is uninhabited.
Obviously, it wouldn't be right to take a Gate from a world that depended on it for trade.
Wait a minute.
I think I've heard of this planet.
You have?
Yeah, I have.
And I heard that this planet is completely uninhabited.
It's what I heard.
I don't know about you guys, but I've got a good feeling about this planet.
Well, then we could retrofit the Gate for space deployment.
Beautiful and brilliant.
The two Bs.
Dr. Weir.
Oh, hi, John.
We were just discussing the Gate harvesting program.
Yeah, I heard.
And Lucius knows of an excellent planet we should investigate.
I heard that, too.
We got intel that the Wraith recently set up a major outpost there.
An alliance of three hives.
No.
- Really?
- Has your intel been verified?
We haven't put boots on the ground, no, but our contacts are trustworthy.
I'm not going to send a team down there, not when there's still plenty of Gates to scout.
John, you are way behind Rodney's quota.
Forget Rodney's quota.
I am not sending a team into harm's way.
You know what?
Colonel Sheppard is right.
Don't get me wrong... with all your advanced weapons, you could easily dispose of a tiny wraith outpost, if there even is an outpost, but ultimately, is it worth the risk?
No matter how small that risk may be.
I mean, sure,
- people may label you a coward...
- Will you knock it off?
Colonel.
I think it's worth investigating.
No.
I won't allow it.
John... are you questioning my authority?
When it comes to the security of this base, you're damn right I am.
From now on, no one goes through that Gate without my authorization.
What a terrible cold he must have.
This is not like him, Lucius.
I apologize.
He makes me uncomfortable.
- He's really a good man.
- I don't see it.
If he doesn't come around, you're gonna have to do something.
Elizabeth wants to send a team to check out a Gate at a suspected Wraith outpost.
- What is she, nuts?
- Everybody's nuts, Rodney.
- Haven't you noticed?
- Right.
You need to figure out why without drawing too much attention.
I am working on it, but there's not enough of the liquid to work with.
I need more.
I'll go back to Lucius's village.
I'm sure he keeps a stash there.
I'll just grab some.
You're leaving me here alone?
- You said you need the liquid.
- Yeah, but the place is turning into a nuthouse.
Somebody's got to stay.
Just keep away from the nuts.
And you've got to disable the DHD as soon a I'm gone to prevent anybody from dialing out, okay?
Willa.
Sheppard.
Sheppard!
Are you all right?
Where is he?
Lucius?
Did you take him?
Of course, if you did, we're not angry.
He came to my planet on his own.
Please send him back.
It hurts us to be away from him for so long.
Have you always felt this way about him?
No, but one day, as he returned from trading his wares with a distant people, he told me a story, a wonderful, wise, sweet story about something he accidentally stepped in.
And from that day forward, we saw him for the wonderful man he truly is.
And before that?
I am ashamed to admit that I refused to share his bed more than once, and since he has gone, everyone is growing sick.
- It has only gotten worse.
- Take it easy.
Have you ever seen him drink a... a liquid from a small vial?
- His daily medicine.
- Does he need more?
I could bring it to him.
We both can.
I can handle it.
If we get you some... will you bring him home?
Sure.
Incoming wormhole.
Colonel Sheppard's IDC.
And the next day she became my wife, my fifth wife, and now I have six.
You are a scoundrel, you know that's what you are.
Sheppard, come here.
You've got to hear this.
Lucius was just telling the most hysterical story.
Do you know that they have marmots on his planet?
Well, they're not marmots, exactly, but it's a rodent very similar to...
I thought you said you were gonna stay away from the nuts.
Yes, well, I tried to keep to myself, but Lucius here was concerned for me, so he just came down,
Ronon held me against the wall, and Lucius and I had a nice, long talk.
Oh, you did.
And let me tell you, we have nothing to worry about with this guy.
This guy's just a big knucklehead.
Aren't you, you big knucklehead?
Where's Elizabeth?
She's out making me something to eat.
- What?
- I don't know.
She said it was a surprise.
So Rodney and I were waiting here for the team to return.
We thought that you were them.
Teyla, Ronon, and Beckett.
They volunteered to check out M6H-491.
- I told you...
- To disable the DHD.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I didn't.
But come on.
- Ronon and Teyla.
I mean, they can handle themselves.
- What about Beckett?
Well, he... now, he can walk on his hands.
Did you know that?
He was showing Lucius before he left.
You should have seen it.
He was down on his hands...
McKay!
We don't know for sure that there are even Wraith on the planet.
We'll find out soon enough, though, won't we?
We sure will.
Atlantis, this is Beckett!
We're coming in hot!
- You all right?
- It was a little rough, but we're good.
It was all terribly exciting.
Well, I guess we can assume there are Wraith on that planet.
Yes.
Many.
Now, don't overreact, John.
Are you kidding me?
You send a team led by Beckett to a planet full of Wraith.
How do you expect me to react?
- Well, firstly, they volunteered.
- And secondly... we got the herb.
Carson,
I will tell people of the tale of your bravery for many years to come.
You will?
Yes, I will.
- You sent them to get an herb?
- We wanted to go.
Okay.
I've just about had enough.
Don't touch it.
What on Earth is wrong with you, John?
We were just helping a friend... and there's nothing wrong with that.
I think there's something wrong with him.
You know what?
I'm just tired.
It's this damn cold.
I apologize.
Maybe you should get some rest.
You're probably right.
I just need a good night's sleep.
So, what does this do?
That engages the HUD.
Stands for "heads up display".
Heads up...
I love that.
It gives me whatever information I need when flying the Jumper.
Navigation, weapons...
- You can fly this?
- I can fly it, too.
Yes, now that you received the A.T.A. Therapy, which I invented.
I was actually born with the gene, which makes me much more proficient at operating ancient technology.
It does not.
He doesn't fly this thing any better than I do.
Don't you lie to Lucius...
All right... boys, stop fighting.
A gene, you say?
It's a genetic fingerprint, if you will, which allows someone such as me to operate any technology on Atlantis.
I developed an inoculation which allows those who don't naturally possess the gene, such as Dr. McKay, to be able to use some of it as well.
Really?
A gene, huh?
You said an inoculation, huh?
That's great.
You know what's really interesting...
if you look at this down here...
Doc?
Could I speak with you for a sec?
Excuse me.
I... think there might be something wrong with me.
It's all right, son.
Admitting it is the first step.
So you finally came around, did you?
You see, once you get a chance to know Lucius, he's really a very wise and kind...
Oh, crap.
Why is the Jumper bay roof opening?
Jumper three is starting up.
Who's in it?
I don't know.
Jumper three, please identify.
Jumper three, this is flight.
Identify yourself.
Look, close the door.
It's too late.
It's left the bay.
Hey, Carson.
Sorry about that.
What...
Why...
I'm taking you to the mainland.
It's for your own good.
Trust me.
- How often does that happen?
- This has never happened before.
- You know, we have very, very strict flight protocol...
- He'd have to have a key or something...
A security officer saw Colonel Sheppard carrying Dr. Beckett toward the Jumper bay moments before the Jumper took off.
So it was them in the flying machine?
My computer's missing.
A tablet, two drives, all of my research.
I told you that man was dangerous.
- I have to say, Liz, I am very disappointed right now.
- I am so very sorry, Lucius.
Mobilize Jumper teams.
- I want them found.
- Yes.
They're very good.
They will find them.
I need to get back.
No, you don't.
Lucius needs me.
You have no right to abduct me like this.
Call it an intervention.
You probably don't realize it right now, but what you're going through is kind of like a... a detox.
Now, according to the research Rodney was able to do before joining the Lucius fan club, that liquid he's been drinking contains some kind of a chemical.
It interacts with the body and causes a secretion of a pheromone, and then there's something about gamma activity in the prefrontral cortrex.
Prefrontal cortex.
The part of the brain responsible for positive emotions.
See, that's why I need you.
It seems that when people are exposed to this pheromone, in close proximity, it makes them... easy to influence, and the longer they're exposed, the worse the addiction gets.
You mean literally an addictive personality?
That's what it looks like.
It's rubbish!
Check for yourself.
I will bet you a year's pay that the liquid in that vial is some kind of extract made from the herb that you collected for him.
He made you his mule.
If this is true, why weren't you affected?
My cold.
I can hardly breathe.
Plus...
I haven't been around him much.
Look...
I would just kidnap him and take him away somewhere until the pheromone wore off, but the people back on his home planet are starting to get sick, and it looks like they're going to get worse before they get better.
I don't want to put our people through that.
You're doing it to me right now!
Buck up, Carson.
You haven't been exposed that long.
Look, I need you to figure out a way how to counteract this thing.
There's got to be an antidote of some kind.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can beat it.
But he needs me.
We should head back.
We've been searching for hours.
We just left, McKay.
I don't like being this far away from Atlantis.
Lucius is probably worried.
You think he's worried?
Jumper two, report.
We're reading several life signs, but they might be Athosian hunting parties, we're going to go check them out.
- Is Lucius worried about us?
- Lucius?
He's fine.
Just keep looking.
I should have stayed with him.
Wait just a minute.
What is it?
Don't move.
That thing is set to stun, right?
Yeah.
Good.
Carson are you all right?
I will be once I get back to Lucius.
What did you shoot him for?
Now we're gonna have to carry him all the way back to the Jumper.
Good morning, Colonel.
I want to apologize for this harsh treatment.
I hate that Elizabeth had to do this.
Cut the crap.
So... that herb of yours...
One of my greatest discoveries.
Well, it's my only great discover but you got to admit, it's pretty great.
How did you get by before that?
I was a baker.
Bread, mostly.
The occasional muffin at festival time.
So that herb pretty much changed everything.
Yeah.
Yeah, I baked it into my own bread...
I like to experiment... and I noticed that people started to like me.
Well, hate me less but pretty soon it became "like".
So I perfected a potion.
It worked great for years.
Then the Wraith set up an outpost on the only planet where I could get the herb.
I knew I could never go back there.
Until we showed up.
I'm telling you, it was fate... and everybody wanted to help, so I let them.
See, that's the great thing about this herb.
Nobody gets hurt.
They just want to help me all the time.
What's wrong with that?
I'm a nice guy.
I never make them do anything they didn't want to do.
Six wives?
Sometimes all at once.
You know, when you get over this cold, you and I are going to have a long chat, face to face, and I've got a feeling we're going to become the best of friends,
and you're going to want to help me, too all the time, and you'll love it.
Just a warning, Lucius... you get too close to me, it'll be the last thing you do.
That's all right, Colonel.
I'm in no rush.
Lucius?
Yeah, go ahead, Carson.
I've finished preparing the inoculation.
All right, I'll be right down.
I've got to go get an inoculation.
We'll talk after.
He's giving you the A.T.A. therapy?
Yeah.
Isn't that great?
There.
All done.
Now, remember,
- it's only effective in 47% of those who receive it.
- Well, I'm a naturally lucky fella.
The only way to know for sure is to have you try to operate something.
Okay.
It takes about an hour to be effective.
In the meantime, just rest easy, dear friend.
Are you feeling okay?
Can I get you anything?
No, Rodney.
I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Absolutely.
- Because it would be no trouble.
- Mess hall.
Blue jello.
Just a little bit of whipped cream.
Right away.
We really should talk about marriage.
Jumper one, this is flight.
The bay doors are open.
You are go for launch.
"Go for launch".
That's so exciting.
Thanks Rodney.
All right, here goes.
I'll take it from here.
You're supposed to be in jail.
Carson.
Save your breath, your charm no longer has any effect on me.
No... no, but...
Carson... we're supposed to be best of friends.
Carson didn't give you the A.T.A. gene.
What?
I'm afraid it's a serum that effectively neutralizes the chemical in that herb of yours.
Took some myself.
I don't know what that means.
It means we can have that face to face conversation you always wanted us to have.
The only thing that will happen is you'll catch my cold.
What is taking him so long?
I should go up there.
Wait.
Wait!
They're taking off.
It worked!
He's flying it.
"He flies.
He flies so beautifully!"
Fly, Lucius, fly.
Where are you taking me?
Little vacation.
Just enough time to let Dr. Beckett give the serum to the rest of my people without you interfering.
And then what?
Then maybe i'll take you back home.
I'm sure your people will be thrilled to see you again.
You would do that for me?
Without even being under the effect of the herb?
- After all I did?
- Well, I'm a nice guy.
Oh, Colonel, I can't thank you enough.
- Thank you so much...
- After I give them the serum.
So how was Lucius' homecoming?
Well... they didn't kill him, although I do see a string of divorces in his future.
That's if they haven't strung him up first.
Well, the townspeople are over their withdrawal and on the mend, so I doubt that will happen.
That is, unless we discover he's revealed the location of Atlantis to anyone.
In which case I said I would track him down,
- hang him by his feet and cut off his...
- Thank you.
We get the idea.
So everyone here... back to normal?
We're still fine, John.
No lingering desires?
Secret longings for his touch?
It's embarrassing enough without you constantly reminding us thank you.
All right, all right.
Hey, buddy, I'd better get back and clean your quarters before the next scout.
Right.
Rodney.
It was one teeny, tiny taste, for research purposes.
- Burn it.
- All of it.
Right now.
Fine.
Story of my life.
What an adorable child, Yoon.
She's like a little doll.
How come I have never met this little munchkin before?
She usually stays with the sitter while we go shopping.
She's such a cutie.
Well, we're running a little late today so, if you'll excuse us.
Oh here, let me help you, dear.
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.
I doubt they'll hear us.
They've been playing that Chinese stuff all morning.
Actually, it's Korean.
Oh, right, sorry.
You know, Sun usually leaves the back door open.
Come on.
My aunt burned down her house like this.
She really should be more careful.
Oh, now that's better.
I'm not usually one to complain.
I don't understand, McGee.
Sensitivity training?
A seminar on the basics of communication
- and understanding in the workplace.
- I know what sensitivity is.
I'm asking why we have to spend the whole afternoon studying it.
Professional development?
If it were survival training, advanced demolitions, perhaps...
I don't think that Sympathetic Seminars, Inc. offers those classes
Skilled investigators should already be well-versed in the subtleties
- of inter-human communication.
- I like Italian women.
You're Italian, right?
I like Irish women, too.
- I stand corrected.
- You 2 better hurry up.
- You don't wanna miss out on the fun.
- Where are you going?
Prior engagement.
Take notes for me.
You do understand the meaning of the word "mandatory," don't you?
I have been ordered to inspect the secure-file room, Probie.
Sadly, that conflicts with your exciting seminar today.
No, it doesn't.
This order is for next Wednesday.
- What?
- Look on the bright side, Tony.
It should only take about 5 to 7 hours.
There's gotta be some way out of this.
Maybe I could injure myself.
- What?
I was only trying to help.
- I was only kidding.
Sensitivity training is gonna have to wait.
We got a double homicide at Quantico.
Marine wives.
Grab your gear.
Yes.
- Inappropriate?
- A bit.
You're probably the reason we have to take these classes.
- Today.
- On your 6, Boss.
You know, this kind of reminds me of my cousin's house, minus all the blood.
Unless you count that Thanksgiving back in '98.
Family does have a way of fraying one's nerves.
Take my Mother, for instance.
She insists on watching Jeopardy every night on the television.
What's wrong with that, Duck?
The same episode, over and over again.
I made the mistake of taping it for her once.
I always say, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your family.
There's a touch of the poet in you, Mr. Palmer.
I'd say you're just more touched.
DiNozzo.
House belongs to a Sergeant Malcolm Porter and his wife, Sun, Boss.
She's the one on the left.
Sergeant's still on liberty trying to track him down.
The other Vic is Min Crane.
She's married to a Sergeant Floyd Crane, currently deployed in Iraq.
Sign of an unhappy marriage.
Funny, I thought it looked like a hole in the wall.
It's about fist size.
Husband probably hit the wall instead of hitting his wife.
- What else do you see?
- Judging by the position of the body
- I'd say they were taken by surprise.
- Yeah?
Why?
Body posture, they're too relaxed.
They didn't fight back.
That could also mean they knew the identity of their attacker.
Search the rest of the house.
Little girl's becoming quite the crime scene investigator, isn't she, Boss?
I'll go help McGee talk to the women who found them.
- You got a TOD yet, Duck?
- Very recent.
Both liver probes indicate about 2½ hours ago.
Triple tap, all in the heart.
Yeah, but notice these burn marks around the entry wounds here and on this one.
So, both of those, the weapon was in direct contact with the body
- when fired.
- 2 from across the room.
Then 1 each up close, just to be sure.
I don't believe the term "overkill"
would be inappropriate, under these circumstances.
- Bullets didn't penetrate.
- Maybe they were small-caliber.
Did you find any casings?
The shooter policed his brass, Duck.
Policed, sir?
Yes, it's military terminology for cleaning up after one's self.
We may be dealing with a professional.
- Professional what?
- Killer, Mr. Palmer.
These poor women weren't so much murdered as executed.
She just needs her bottle.
I know I packed it.
Look, look, look.
Your Mom's right there.
She's right there.
Did you ever hold a baby before, McGee?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
Boss, this is Mrs. Dawson.
She found the body along with the next-door neighbors.
We were going into Koreatown, shopping.
I'm the only one with a car.
Sun asked me to come pick them up.
If we'd been on time...
You need some help?
Any idea where Sun's husband is, Mrs. Dawson?
No, he's never here when we come over.
I don't think he likes Sun having friends.
What makes you think that?
He's very controlling.
- Sergeant Porter abused her?
- Sun wouldn't admit it.
But we suspected.
He drinks.
Says mean things to her.
Wouldn't let her speak Korean in the house.
We tried to reason with her but...
- She wouldn't leave him?
- She was ashamed.
It's hard for a Korean woman to ask for help.
- Find Porter.
- I'd start at the "E" Club.
- James.
- I'm Yoon's husband.
Listen, if you don't find Porter there, you might wanna check some of the bars outside the front gate.
I'm on it, Boss.
Everything's gonna be okay now, honey, okay?
Gibbs, a word please?
I just talked to her a few hours ago.
Gun safe, I found it in the master bedroom.
Open and empty except for a handful of shells.
.40 caliber.
Thinking maybe the husband did this, yes?
I guess the polite term, Agent DiNozzo, would be "bastard."
He was always borrowing my husband's tools and never returning them.
I should've known this would happen.
Stealing tools isn't really a prerequisite for murder, Mrs. Goodwin.
All I'm saying is the 2 of them had one hell of a marriage.
You wouldn't know it to look at her, but Sun's got a set of lungs.
Or at least she did.
- So, they fought a lot?
- Oh, hardly a night went by you didn't hear all sorts of screaming coming from this house.
- You ever think to make a complaint?
- I don't like to stick my nose in.
Good thing, too.
It could have been me that got slaughtered.
On our way, McGee.
Sergeant Porter was spotted 30 minutes ago at the "E" Club.
- McGee's almost there.
- Thanks.
Probie's not gonna make a move on his own, is he, Boss?
McGee can take care of himself, DiNozzo.
You're on the hump.
- He's gone.
- Nice job, Probie.
The bartender turned around, Sgt. Porter wasn't there anymore.
- You let him get past you?
- It was before I got here, Tony.
What's Sergeant Porter driving?
- What kind of car does he drive?
- A black 2004 Ford F-150, Boss.
Hey, come on.
Boss, we got a weapon in the front seat.
I think he's dead, Boss.
NCIS.
Don't move.
Get your hands on the wheel.
I wasn't gonna drive.
Come on, it's not DUI if I don't have the key in the ignition, look.
- What's he talking about?
- I think he thinks we're busting him
- for driving drunk.
- Well, you're not?
No,
- it's for double homicide.
- McGee.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
I knew he was alive.
Precision, Mr. Palmer.
It's what separates the professional from the dilettante.
Thank you, Doctor.
Now, careful.
Not too much pressure.
But not too little either.
All right, come on, come on, come on.
Let's see.
Yes, very good.
Not bad, not bad at all.
Keep a steady hand.
There's no room for error.
You never know which element of the enigma, however minuscule, can lead you to the solution.
Palmer just got some of your elements on his plastic thing.
- Occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
- What can you tell me, Duck?
Both women were shot 3 times in the chest.
It's hard to say which of these 6 was the fatal wound.
Suffice to say, neither woman died of old age.
- Anything else?
- Yes, Mrs. Porter has some swelling and fissures on her fingers and knuckles.
- Defensive wounds.
- Possibly.
Yeah, but these didn't happen today.
There are also bruises on her wrists.
I'd say they were at least a week old.
She was abused?
Yeah.
- Thanks, Duck.
- You have the man in custody now?
Yeah.
There's no need to be gentle with him, Jethro.
You missed a spot.
We're looking at a Beretta Cougar 8040, Gibbs.
It was registered to Sergeant Porter in 2003
- and it's got his fingerprints all over it.
- Bullets?
Cross-point .40 caliber Smith and Wesson.
Also called a "Short and Wimpy," although I do not know why.
They lack the power of a 10mm auto-load.
You don't need that stopping power when you gun down housewives.
- What about gunshot residue?
- Instant Shooter Kit came negative
- on Porter's skin, shirt and pants.
- Could've worn gloves...
Or he could've changed clothes.
I'm way ahead of you Gibbs.
That's why I'm doing a full analysis on all of Porter's wardrobe.
"How long, Abby?" Well, it's gonna take some time.
And since this stuff doesn't smell very good
I don't think laundry was a priority. "Abs."
2 hours.
Whenever I know something, you'll know something.
"You got one.
Anything else?" Yes, as a matter of fact.
This is for you.
- Why?
- For getting me out of sensitivity training.
We were about to do trust falls and those guys in administration have wandering hands.
"Just give me their names, Abs, and I'll break them for you."
I know you will, Gibbs.
And that is why I love you.
Boss, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.
What did I say about apologizing, McGee?
Sign of weakness.
So is barfing on your tie.
This isn't mine.
We've got Sergeant Porter in interrogation.
I actually managed to dodge most of it.
Good news is that he is sober enough to talk now.
I got some on you, here, let me get this.
- Don't.
- Sorry.
I mean, it won't happen again.
- Who's watching him?
- Tony and Ziva.
I was actually just gonna go change my shirt.
No, you won't.
You're gonna follow up on other leads.
We found Sergeant Porter with the murder weapon.
What other leads?
A good investigator doesn't sit back and wait.
You run down every angle, every lead.
Assume everything you've been told is a lie, until it checks out.
Got it.
There's only one time I want you to stop, McGee.
- When you tell me.
- When you're satisfied.
When you're satisfied.
Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Get me another cup of coffee.
This is gonna be good.
Gibbs will rip this guy apart.
I don't know if that's the right tactic in this case, Tony.
What, are you an expert on suspect interviews, now?
Interviews, no.
Interrogation techniques, yes.
Like hooking a car battery up to a guy's privates?
I'm sure it's effective, but judges tend to frown on it.
I've learned from Gibbs that in certain cases you can attract far more bees with honey.
Flies.
- What do flies have to do with honey?
- Flies don't like vinegar.
Vinegar?
It's complicated.
Here he comes.
Here you go.
There.
You look like you could use it.
My wife's really dead, sir?
How?
Drink your coffee, Sergeant.
When you're ready we'll work our way up to it.
What's he doing?
Where's his strong-arming?
The intimidation?
The psychological bullying?
The Gibbs?
Bad marriage?
It's okay.
I've had a few myself.
It wasn't perfect, but I loved her, sir.
Problem was...
I don't think...
I don't think she ever loved me.
I'll bet she loved that paycheck, though, right?
Yeah.
I should have known it.
Just look at me.
She was way out of my league, you know?
She just married me to get to the States.
It happens.
Thing is...
I guess I always thought she might change her mind, you know?
Then she started sneaking out to the "O" Club, hanging out with officers.
I've seen it before.
She thought she could trade up.
She didn't want me.
No matter what I did.
It just got to the point...
I just wanted her to disappear.
Yeah, when you get pushed, you want to push back.
That why you decide to blow her away?
Excuse me, sir?
Is that the reason you shot Min Crane and your wife to death today?
Okay, here we go.
He hasn't confessed yet.
- He will.
- Maybe.
- How much do you wanna bet?
- How about nothing?
- $20?
- Deal.
I'm telling you I didn't kill them, sir.
The murder weapon was in your truck, Sergeant.
Someone must have put it there.
Your fingerprints are all over it.
I didn't shoot my wife, sir.
Did you use your fists on her, Sergeant?
Knock her around a little bit, or maybe or maybe that just wasn't cutting it anymore.
I never laid a hand on Sun.
Your neighbor heard the fights, Sergeant,
I saw the hole you punched.
I only punched the hole in the wall so I wouldn't hit her, sir.
Her hands were all bruised and cut from where she fought you off all the time.
- That's not how it happened.
- Really?
How did I get it wrong?
How'd it happen?
She was the... she the one who was abusing me.
You don't believe me?
Take a look at this.
Sit down.
Sun was violent, sir.
She hit me.
She called me names.
She threw things.
I tried to hold her off but I never...
I never once laid a hand on her.
I just wanted it to stop.
- Pay up.
- He didn't confess.
- It was damn close.
- Close doesn't cut it, DiNozzo.
Well, we got enough evidence even if you didn't break him in interrogation, Boss.
Not to say that you couldn't have broken him if you wanted to.
I really like that shirt.
Tony's right.
We have Sgt. Porter's gun with his fingerprints in his car.
He blows away his wife and her friend in a rage.
Gets drunk.
Passes out
- before he can commit suicide.
- Why did he police his brass?
- Habit of a well-trained Marine.
- He worked the motor pool.
According to his records, he failed to qualify twice on the pistol range last year.
Abby get the results of the GSR tests on his clothing yet?
- All negative, Boss.
- He could have worn gloves
- or got rid of the clothes he's wearing.
- But he leaves his pistol in full view on the front seat.
Boss, I think I've got something here.
I just spoke with the Director of the Officers' Club.
Apparently Sun Porter was a regular fixture there.
Almost always with Min Crane.
A month ago, they were all banned.
- For what, McGee?
- One of their husbands showed up, made a scene, had to be carried out.
Another nail in Sergeant Porter's coffin.
It wasn't Sergeant Porter, Tony.
Sergeant James Dawson.
Yoon's husband.
Heard you guys got Sergeant Porter at the "E" Club with the murder weapon.
I knew they were having troubles, but never expected this.
Where's your wife, Sergeant Dawson?
She's taking a nap with our daughter.
Why?
Is something wrong, sir?
What happened at the Officers' Club last month?
Let me refresh your memory.
You had an altercation with 2 Marine Captains.
Yeah, it was nothing.
It was just a misunderstanding.
Big enough for a Letter of Reprimand in your SRB.
Maybe we should ask your wife about it, Sergeant?
- She had a rough day.
I'd rather not...
- Down the hall?
Yeah, but I'd rather not disturb her.
- We'll see if she's still breathing.
- You think I killed Sun and Min because they had a couple of drinks with my wife at the "O" Club?
Mrs. Dawson, NCIS.
We're gonna ask you a few questions.
Yoon.
It's me.
Please, Yoon, open up.
- Do you have a key?
- It's locked from the inside.
Yoon.
Yoon.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Someone kills my wife's 2 best friends, then they decide to kidnap her?
When's the last time you saw her, Sergeant?
About an hour before you showed up.
She was putting the baby to sleep in our room.
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.
Can we stop standing around and do something?
We are.
We are.
Sit down.
And what exactly is that, sir?
Figuring out if you're a suspect or a victim.
The window was broken from the outside.
Whoever did this slipped in, grabbed her and slipped out.
None of the neighbors heard or saw anything unusual, Boss.
MP's are searching the area.
Also checking every vehicle leaving the base.
- You think she still might be on base?
- It's possible.
We need to be out there looking for her.
If she's still on base, we'll find her.
Someone put a lot of effort into taking her away without alerting you.
There's a good chance she's not dead yet.
Yet?
Oh, God, why would someone do this?
For the same reason someone killed her friends.
You think I had something to do with this?
Sit down.
What happened at the Officers' Club, Sergeant?
It was nothing, okay?
Sun and Min go there all the time.
Yoon just drops them off.
This one time she went in and had a couple of drinks.
She couldn't drive home, so she called me.
- Gibbs.
- Boss...
When did you get into a verbal altercation with the Marine Captains?
They were drunk, okay?
They were hitting on my wife.
They tried to stop me from taking her home.
What would you do, sir?
You think one of these Captains might have had something to do with this?
We're wasting our time.
I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with this.
I know that.
Your alibi just checked out.
The Sergeant was on duty at the time of the shootings.
So, what now, sir?
3 Korean women met and married Marines in Seoul at roughly the same time. 2 of them are dead.
Our prime suspect was locked up here when the 3rd went missing.
Think it's a racial thing?
No, definitely do not think that it's a hate crime.
In my experience, there's only one color in the Marines.
What I've seen of your Marine Corps, it's very ethnically diverse.
He means green, Ziva.
And I think he's right.
Well, maybe it's a Korean thing.
Maybe something in their past.
Like some kind of blood feud.
Competing villages, ancient oaths, revenge from across the ocean.
This is not one of your stupid action movies, Tony.
No, it isn't.
If it was, you'd be dressed differently.
And you'd be far better looking.
You'd be dead by the opening credits.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe I am the plucky comic relief?
You find out what the hell happened to Yoon Dawson yet?
Plucky?
- Well, Ziva and Tony and I...
- Were just working on that, Boss.
We're going through a list of anyone who had access to the base in the last 2 days.
So far, no solid leads.
What about the Marines Sergeant Dawson fought with?
Both transferred out of Quantico last month.
One at Camp Pendleton, the other is in Okinawa.
The 2 dead women lived insular lives.
They spent most of their time together with other Koreans.
Yoon Dawson seems to be the only one who embraced American life.
Any reason to believe that Sergeant Porter isn't still involved in this?
He could have had an accomplice, Probie.
He could have had 3, DiNozzo.
We need more information.
Actually, Boss, Abby and I, we have been working on something.
We got the women's phone records, credit card receipts, address books.
Abby is referencing to see if there's a pattern.
DiNozzo, I want to know about anybody in the area who's made threats against Koreans, foreign Marine wives, or women.
Oh, is that all?
- On it, Boss.
- Find out about their lives before they married Marines.
Come on, you're with me, Elf Lord.
It's amazing how much you can find out about someone without actually meeting them.
For instance, me and these women have absolutely nothing in common.
They web-browse for cake recipes, gardening tips and Min Crane has some weird obsession with stained glass.
That's not even mentioning their music downloads.
One word:
Yanni.
Good point.
Who cares?
Their schedules were pretty regulated.
On Wednesdays and Fridays they trekked to Koreatown.
They'd shop for a couple of hours, then they'd have tea at Lee's Neighborhood Market.
They alternated paying.
It was Sun Porter's turn, by the way.
Not exactly groundbreaking police work there.
- She's not done yet, McGee.
- Thank you, Gibbs.
Within the last month, all 3 of them received regular phone calls from a pay phone located just outside Lee's Neighborhood Market.
It is owned and operated by Lee Sung.
He sells Korean delicacies, fruits and vegetables and those cute little anime figurines with the funny faces.
Oh, I love those.
He also has a catering business, Lee's Delights.
It's authentic Korean food.
Very high end.
All 3 women have worked for him as hostesses and they were scheduled to work an event for him tomorrow afternoon.
- How do you know?
- Because.
Lee's Sung e-mailed them the instructions.
It's a Korean diplomatic event at the Pacific Rim Society.
Tell me I didn't just smack McGee for no good reason.
You didn't smack McGee for no good reason.
Last night, Yoon Dawson used her cell phone to call the pay phone outside Lee's Market.
2 hours later... she's missing.
Why is this important?
Because someone is still using her cell phone to call that pay phone.
- Can we get a fix on the phone?
- Negatory, McGee.
I know it's somewhere in Annandale, Virginia, but they turn it off before I can get an exact location.
The last phone call was an hour ago.
McGee, I want a tap on that damn pay phone.
Abby, I wanna know who answers it.
That's good work, Abs.
What was that for?
For mocking my groundbreaking police work.
I was not mocking you...
Won't happen again.
Damn, I can't believe this.
I don't really like waiting here either, Tony.
No, Nick and Jessica broke up.
I'm always the last to know.
Hey, DiNozzo.
- Shut up.
- Shutting up, Boss.
Hey Probie, you getting this?
Yeah, got it, Tony.
It's Yoon Dawson's cell phone again.
I want a location, McGee.
Whoever it is, they disabled the on-board GPS chip.
We'll have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Just take a moment to get a bead on the cell phone grid it's interfacing with.
We got someone headed to the phone, Boss.
- You want us to take him down now?
- Negative.
Wait until we trace the call.
Okay, I've got the cell phone grid located.
It's coming from this neighborhood.
Somewhere on this street.
You copy that, DiNozzo?
Well, we're scanning for targets now.
There are a lot of possibles.
If you don't respond, I'm gonna hang up.
Don't, I have information for you.
Ball cap, head down, heading towards the pay phone.
Got him.
Drop your weapon.
Federal agents, move!
It's Yoon Dawson, Boss.
She's rabbiting.
We're cutting her off, DiNozzo.
I know she didn't pass us.
Well, where the hell did she go?
It's like she disappeared.
She didn't disappear.
It's her hat.
She climbed her way out.
If I am here, I answer the pay phone, Agent McGee.
Many people in this community are poor.
Can't afford phone service, so I take messages for them.
You see, it helps them and it is good for my business when they come to pick up.
Boss, did you find her?
Yeah, McGee.
She's hiding in my coffee cup.
We didn't find her.
Just give us one second, please.
Has he calmed down yet?
Well, he's a little shaky but I think he's ready to talk.
Min and Sun.
They are dead?
It's my fault.
I take responsibility.
I try to help people new to this country.
Find jobs for them, get them training, classes.
Sometimes even loan money.
You hired all 3 of them to work for your catering company?
I did.
I would notice when Yoon was tired, her accent would change.
Sometimes she would use words not common in my country since the war.
Yoon-Sook Dawson wasn't South Korean.
I began to believe that she was from the North.
Perhaps a spy?
Why didn't you go to the police?
Well, I couldn't be sure.
What if I was wrong?
I asked Min and Sun to find out where she grew up, what schools she go to.
Then I check her answers and try to locate relatives from Korea.
- Nothing.
- Who else knew
- you were checking up on her?
- Min Crane, Sun Porter and myself.
She was trying to protect her cover?
She failed.
We're taking you into protective custody, Mr. Sung.
No.
I will not hide.
- Mr. Sung, she could come back.
- Let her.
I am ready this time.
I won't stop living my life because of people like her.
- Sir, I really don't think that this...
- Mr. Sung.
Thank you for your help.
If you think of anything else, give me a call.
Yes, I will.
And please thank your agents for me.
Boss, you're not really gonna let him just...
McGee, you know the FBI does not exist only to piss me off.
Sometimes they can actually be useful.
Hey, Fornell.
I got one right up your jurisdiction.
Like my Father always said, "Be careful who you marry, Anthony."
"She may end up being a homicidal maniac."
- Your Father actually said that to you?
- No, but I'm sure he thought it.
Probably he knew your taste in women.
Abby's got active taps on Sergeant Dawson's cell, home and work phones, Boss.
- If she calls her husband, we'll know.
- She won't.
The FBI team shadowing Mr. Sung is tied directly into MTAC.
They're last report had him loading up a catering truck for a job.
No sign of Yoon Dawson yet.
It's highly doubtful she'd make another attempt on his life.
We've got 4 agents providing surveillance on Dawson's house.
She definitely won't be returning home.
And how do you know this, Officer David?
Because Yoon Dawson wouldn't.
Now tell us what you'd do.
If I was Yoon, everything I've done up to this point was to protect my cover.
I've dealt with the 2 possible threats on base and...
If by "dealt" you mean gunning down 2 defenseless housewives...
I attempted to deal with the 3rd, but my cover was blown.
I'm now only left with a few possibilities.
You rush back to your country?
Or carry out whatever mission I was assigned before I'm captured or killed.
She's been in the States for 3 years.
If you had a mission, wouldn't you have carried it out?
Not if I'm a sleeper, McGee.
She could be here for decades before being activated.
So, tell us, Jane Bond, how do we track you down?
You don't, Tony.
By now I've changed my appearance, I've replaced my identity with backup documents and I've relocated.
Promise?
Okay, so that about wraps it up.
Who's up for lunch?
You might think about this, I'm gonna pay.
No one's eating until we find Yoon Dawson.
It's not that Tony couldn't stand to lose a little weight but we'd all starve to death before that happened.
She's playing it like I would.
She's gone.
There's one difference between the 2 of you, Ziva.
You don't have a baby girl.
Most likely part of her cover or an occupational accident.
- It's more than that.
- How can you tell?
My gut.
Come on.
You're with me.
Let's go.
Hey Probie, let me ask you a question.
You don't think she was serious about the whole losing a few pounds thing?
Are you gonna hit me if I tell you the truth?
No, man.
We're buds.
Yeah.
My wife is not a spy, sir.
Her South Korean passport's a forgery.
It's not possible, okay?
Yoon loves this country.
She knows more about it than me.
She was trained to, it's called a honey trap.
Her assignment was to meet an eligible serviceman, seduce him and gain access into this country.
Oh, yeah?
Then why was she trying to convince me to leave the Marine Corps and go to college?
Most likely you were not part of the assignment.
- You were a means to an end.
- Listen.
Okay,
I've lived with her for 5 years.
She's the Mother of my child.
I'm telling you, there's no way.
- What's this?
- Your wife.
No, that can't be real.
It's real.
Min Crane and Sun Porter?
She killed them?
- Oh, my God.
- Has she tried to contact you?
- No.
- She's a foreign agent, Marine.
You lie about this, it's treason.
She hasn't.
She hasn't tried to contact me, sir.
Okay, we think she might.
If she does and you confront her, she will most likely kill you.
I just can't believe this.
Go ahead.
- Hello?
- It's me, James.
Yoon, what the hell is going on?
NCIS is here.
- They're telling me all sorts of things.
- Don't speak.
Just listen to me, okay?
You need to come home now.
It's too late for that.
I've done things.
- Terrible things.
- I don't care, alright?
Tell me where you are and I'll come and get you.
There's one more thing that I need to do.
I don't have a choice.
- I never had a choice.
- Just tell me why.
- Please, sweetheart.
- No matter what they say, what they tell you about me, know that I loved you with all my heart.
That it was for real.
And tell Rebecca... tell her Mommy is sorry for this.
All of it.
This is insane.
Yoon, you can't do...
I love you both so much, more than you can imagine but I can't let it happen.
Yoon, don't.
Yoon, don't hang up.
I got her, Tony.
She's at a pay phone in Annandale, Virginia.
The corner of Raven Road and Lancaster Drive.
- Way to go, Abs.
- Kind of a weird place to be hiding out.
There's nothing there except country clubs.
Lee Sung's catering job?
The Pacific Rim Society.
It's in Annandale!
Either that's a coincidence or she really, really wants to kill this guy.
- I don't believe in coincidence.
- "I don't believe in coincidence."
No.
No, Yoon.
Where is it, Lee Sung?
Have you no honor left, woman?
More than you.
Scream and I kill you.
Found out why the FBI isn't responding, Boss.
- She's definitely here.
- Keep looking, DiNozzo.
I'm right behind you.
I will kill you if you don't answer this time.
Where?
In the truck.
Drop the weapon.
There's a bomb set to go off in this building.
If you kill me now, we all die.
Put your weapon down.
I was a North Korean operative.
We kind of figured that part out on our own.
The part that you don't know is that my cell included Sun Porter,
- Min Crane and this man.
- She's lying.
I swear on the life of my daughter that I'm trying to prevent this attack.
And I swear if you don't release your weapon, I will kill you.
The bomb is in his truck.
Please, we may only have minutes left.
- Now do you believe me?
- Can you disarm it?
If I had a couple of days, maybe.
You?
I could try.
But I suggest not standing within 5 miles of here while I attempt it.
- I can.
- She put it there.
She's trying to kill us all.
They're evacuating the building, Boss.
And the...
- That's a really big bomb.
- You think, DiNozzo?
I didn't kill them to maintain my cover, Agent Gibbs.
I did it to keep my family.
- I failed.
- She's a North Korean spy.
Not anymore.
At least let me prevent this.
McGee, get Sung out of here.
- Get the cuffs off her.
- Gibbs.
It's not a debate, Officer David.
Go.
Go on.
Get out of here.
All of you.
Get a clear distance away.
I'll handle it from here.
I don't care how hard you whack me, Boss.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Nor am I.
If we survive this, you're both fired.
It's supposed to do that, right?
It's done.
The bomb is no longer armed.
So, what happens now, sir?
The FBI will take her into custody, Sergeant.
And then prison?
Your wife is an agent of a hostile power.
It all depends what kind of a deal she can make.
She was also responsible for bringing down an entire North Korean cell and saving hundreds of lives, Sergeant.
I'm sure that will be taken into consideration.
Right, Officer David?
Yes, of course.
Her knowledge of the inner workings of North Korean Intelligence should prove to be invaluable.
Guys, give her a minute.
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to do the right thing.
Everything you said to me on the phone,
I believe in you.
I'll always believe it, no matter what happens.
Come here.
It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.
Let's go.
Tony,
Ziva, what happened back there with the bomb,
- I want you both to know...
- You don't have to say it, Boss.
We know how you feel about us.
Gibbs, we're a team.
That's what we do.
I was going to say, if either one of you 2 wing nuts ever disobey a direct order again, I'll kill you myself.
That's our Boss.
What an adorable child, Yoon.
She's like a little doll.
How come I have never met this little munchkin before?
She usually stays with the sitter while we go shopping.
She's such a cutie.
Well, we're running a little late today, so if you'll excuse us.
Oh, here, let me help you, dear.
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.
I doubt they'll hear us.
They've been playing that Chinese stuff all morning.
Actually, it's Korean.
Oh, right, sorry.
You know, Sun usually leaves the back door open.
Come on.
My aunt burned down her house like this.
She really should be more careful.
Oh, now that's better.
I'm not usually one to complain.
I don't understand, McGee.
Sensitivity training?
A seminar on the basics of communication
- and understanding in the workplace.
- l know what sensitivity is.
I'm asking why we have to spend the whole afternoon studying it.
Professional development?
If it were survival training, advanced demolitions, perhaps-- l don't think that Sympathetic Seminars, lnc. offers those classes
Skilled investigators should already be well-versed in the subtleties
- of inter-human communication.
- l like Italian women.
You're Italian, right?
I like Irish women, too.
- l stand corrected.
- You two better hurry up.
- You don't wanna miss out on the fun.
- Where are you going?
Prior engagement.
Take notes for me.
You do understand the meaning of the word "mandatory," don't you?
I have been ordered to inspect the secure-file room, probie.
Sadly, that conflicts with your exciting seminar today.
No, it doesn't.
This order is for next Wednesday.
- What?
- Look on the bright side, Tony.
It should only take about five to seven hours.
There's gotta be some way out of this.
Maybe I could injure myself.
- What?
I was only trying to help.
- l was only kidding.
Sensitivity training is gonna have to wait.
We got a double homicide at Quantico.
Marine wives.
Grab your gear.
Yes.
- lnappropriate?
- A bit.
You're probably the reason we have to take these classes.
- Today.
- On your six, boss.
You know, this kind of reminds me of my cousin's house, minus all the blood.
Unless you count that Thanksgiving back in '98.
Family does have a way of fraying one's nerves.
Take my mother, for instance.
She insists on watching Jeopardy every night on the television.
What's wrong with that, Duck?
The same episode, over and over again.
I made the mistake of taping it for her once.
I always say, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your family.
There's a touch of the poet in you, Mr. Palmer.
I'd say you're just more touched.
DiNozzo.
House belongs to a Sergeant Malcolm Porter and his wife, Sun, boss.
She's the one on the left.
Sergeant's still on liberty trying to track him down.
The other vic is Min Crane.
She's married to a Sergeant Floyd Crane, currently deployed in Iraq.
Sign of an unhappy marriage.
Funny, I thought it looked like a hole in the wall.
It's about fist size.
Husband probably hit the wall instead of hitting his wife.
- What else do you see?
- Judging by the position of the body
- l'd say they were taken by surprise.
- Yeah?
Why?
Body posture.
They're too relaxed.
They didn't fight back.
That could also mean they knew the identity of their attacker.
Search the rest of the house.
Little girl's becoming quite the crime scene investigator, isn't she, boss?
I'll go help McGee talk to the women who found them.
- You got a TOD yet, Duck?
- Very recent.
Both liver probes indicate about two and a half hours ago.
Triple tap, all in the heart.
Yeah, but notice these burn marks around the entry wounds here and on this one.
So both of those, the weapon was in direct contact with the body
- when fired.
- Two from across the room.
Then one each up close, just to be sure.
I don't believe the term "overkill"
would be inappropriate, under these circumstances.
- Bullets didn't penetrate.
- Maybe they were small-calibre.
Did you find any casings?
The shooter policed his brass, Duck.
Policed, sir?
Yes, it's military terminology for cleaning up after one's self.
We may be dealing with a professional.
- Professional what?
- Killer, Mr. Palmer.
These poor women weren't so much murdered as executed.
She just needs her bottle.
I know I packed it.
Look, look, look.
Your mom's right there.
She's right there.
Did you ever hold a baby before, McGee?
- No.
- l didn't think so.
Boss, this is Mrs. Dawson.
She found the body along with the next-door neighbours.
We were going into Koreatown, shopping.
I'm the only one with a car.
Sun asked me to come pick them up.
If we'd been on time--
You need some help?
Any idea where Sun's husband is, Mrs. Dawson?
No, he's never here when we come over.
I don't think he likes Sun having friends.
What makes you think that?
He's very controlling.
- Sergeant Porter abused her?
- Sun wouldn't admit it.
But we suspected.
He drinks.
Says mean things to her.
Wouldn't let her speak Korean in the house.
We tried to reason with her but--
- She wouldn't leave him?
- She was ashamed.
It's hard for a Korean woman to ask for help.
- Find Porter.
- l'd start at the "E" Club.
- James.
- l'm Yoon's husband.
Listen, if you don't find Porter there, you might wanna check some of the bars outside the front gate.
I'm on it, boss.
Everything's gonna be okay now, honey, okay?
Gibbs.
A word, please?
I just talked to her a few hours ago.
Gun safe.
I found it in the master bedroom.
Open and empty except for a handful of shells.
.40 calibre.
Thinking maybe the husband did this, yes?
I guess the polite term, Agent DiNozzo, would be "bastard."
He was always borrowing my husband's tools and never returning them.
I should've known this would happen.
Stealing tools isn't really a prerequisite for murder, Mrs. Goodwin.
All I'm saying is the two of them had one hell of a marriage.
You wouldn't know it to look at her, but Sun's got a set of lungs.
Or at least she did.
- So they fought a lot?
- Oh, hardly a night went by you didn't hear all sorts of screaming coming from this house.
- You ever think to make a complaint?
- l don't like to stick my nose in.
Good thing, too. lt could have been me that got slaughtered.
On our way, McGee.
Sergeant Porter was spotted 30 minutes ago at the "E" Club.
- McGee's almost there.
- Thanks.
Probie's not gonna make a move on his own, is he, boss?
McGee can take care of himself, DiNozzo.
You're on the hump.
- He's gone.
- Nice job, probie.
The bartender turned around, Sgt. Porter wasn't there anymore.
- You let him get past you?
- lt was before I got here, Tony.
What's Sergeant Porter driving?
- What kind of car does he drive?
- A black 2004 Ford F-1 50, boss.
Hey, come on.
Boss, we got a weapon in the front seat.
I think he's dead, boss.
NClS.
Don't move.
Get your hands on the wheel.
I wasn't gonna drive.
Come on, it's not dui if I don't have the key in the ignition, look.
- What's he talking about?
- l think he thinks we're busting him
- for driving drunk.
- Well, you're not?
No.
- lt's for double homicide.
- McGee.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
I knew he was alive.
Precision, Mr. Palmer.
It's what separates the professional from the dilettante.
Thank you, doctor.
Now, careful.
Not too much pressure.
But not too little either.
All right, come on, come on, come on.
Let's see.
Yes, very good.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Keep a steady hand.
There's no room for error.
You never know which element of the enigma, however minuscule, can lead you to the solution.
Palmer just got some of your elements on his plastic thing.
- Occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
- What can you tell me, Duck?
Both women were shot three times in the chest.
It's hard to say which of these six was the fatal wound.
Suffice to say, neither woman died of old age.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
Mrs. Porter has some swelling and fissures on her fingers and knuckles.
- Defensive wounds.
- Possibly.
Yeah, but these didn't happen today.
There are also bruises on her wrists.
I'd say they were at least a week old.
She was abused?
Yeah.
- Thanks, Duck.
- You have the man in custody now?
Yeah.
There's no need to be gentle with him, Jethro.
You missed a spot.
We're looking at a Beretta Cougar 8040, Gibbs.
It was registered to Sergeant Porter in 2003
- and it's got his fingerprints all over it.
- Bullets?
Cross-point .40 calibre Smith and Wesson.
Also called a "Short and Wimpy," although I do not know why.
They lack the power of a 1 0-millimeter auto-load.
You don't need that stopping power when you gun down housewives.
- What about gunshot residue?
- Instant Shooter Kit came negative
- on Porter's skin, shirt and pants.
- Could've worn gloves--
Or he could've changed clothes.
I'm way ahead of you.
That's why I'm doing a full analysis on all of Porter's wardrobe.
"How long, Abby?" Well, it's gonna take some time.
And since this stuff doesn't smell very good I don't think laundry was a priority.
"Abs."
Two hours.
Whenever I know something, you'll know something.
"You got one.
Anything else?" Yes, as a matter of fact.
This is for you.
- Why?
- For getting me out of sensitivity training.
We were about to do trust falls and those guys in administration have wandering hands.
"Just give me their names, Abs, and I'll break them for you."
I know you will, Gibbs.
And that is why I love you.
Boss, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
What did I say about apologising, McGee?
Sign of weakness.
So is barfing on your tie.
This isn't mine.
We've got Sergeant Porter in interrogation.
I actually managed to dodge most of it.
Good news is that he is sober enough to talk now.
I got some on you, here, let me get this.
- Don't.
- Sorry.
I mean, it won't happen again.
- Who's watching him?
- Tony and Ziva.
I was actually just gonna go change my shirt.
No, you won't.
You're gonna follow up on other leads.
We found Sergeant Porter with the murder weapon.
What other leads?
A good investigator doesn't sit back and wait.
You run down every angle, every lead.
Assume everything you've been told is a lie until it checks out.
Got it.
There's only one time I want you to stop, McGee.
- When you tell me.
- When you're satisfied.
When you're satisfied.
Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Get me another cup of coffee.
This is gonna be good.
Gibbs will rip this guy apart.
I don't know if that's the right tactic in this case, Tony.
What, are you an expert on suspect interviews, now?
Interviews, no.
lnterrogation techniques, yes.
Like hooking a car battery up to a guy's privates?
I'm sure it's effective, but judges tend to frown on it.
I've learned from Gibbs that in certain cases you can attract far more bees with honey.
Flies.
- What do flies have to do with honey?
- Flies don't like vinegar.
Vinegar?
It's complicated.
Here he comes.
Here you go.
There.
You look like you could use it.
My wife's really dead, sir?
How?
Drink your coffee, sergeant.
When you're ready we'll work our way up to it.
What's he doing?
Where's his strong-arming?
The intimidation?
The psychological bullying?
The Gibbs?
Bad marriage, huh?
It's okay.
I've had a few myself.
It wasn't perfect, but I loved her, sir.
Problem was... I don't think--
I don't think she ever loved me.
I'll bet she loved that paycheque, though, right?
Yeah.
I should have known it.
Just look at me.
She was way out of my league, you know?
She just married me to get to the States.
It happens.
Thing is... I guess I always thought she might change her mind, you know?
Then she started sneaking out to the "O" Club, hanging out with officers.
I've seen it before.
She thought she could trade up.
She didn't want me.
No matter what I did.
It just got to the point-- l just wanted her to disappear.
Yeah, when you get pushed, you want to push back.
That why you decide to blow her away?
Excuse me, sir?
is that the reason you shot Min Crane and your wife to death today?
Okay, here we go.
He hasn't confessed yet.
- He will.
- Maybe.
- How much do you wanna bet?
- How about nothing?
- Twenty bucks?
- Deal.
I'm telling you I didn't kill them, sir.
The murder weapon was in your truck, sergeant.
Someone must have put it there.
Your fingerprints are all over it.
I didn't shoot my wife, sir.
Did you use your fists on her, sergeant?
Knock her around a little bit, or maybe or maybe that just wasn't cutting it anymore.
I never laid a hand on Sun.
Your neighbour heard the fights, sergeant.
I saw the hole you punched.
I only punched the hole in the wall so I wouldn't hit her, sir.
Her hands were all bruised and cut from where she fought you off all the time.
- That's not how it happened.
- Really?
How did I get it wrong?
How'd it happen?
She was the--
She the one who was abusing me.
You don't believe me?
Take a look at this.
Sit down.
Sun was violent, sir.
She hit me.
She called me names.
She threw things.
I tried to hold her off but I never-- l never once laid a hand on her.
I just wanted it to stop.
- Pay up.
- He didn't confess.
- lt was damn close.
- Close doesn't cut it, DiNozzo.
Well, we got enough evidence even if you didn't break him in interrogation, boss.
Not to say that you couldn't have broken him if you wanted to.
I really like that shirt.
Tony's right. we have Sgt. Porter's gun with his fingerprints in his car.
He blows away his wife and her friend in a rage.
Gets drunk.
Passes out
- before he can commit suicide.
- Why did he police his brass?
- Habit of a well-trained Marine.
- He worked the motor pool.
According to his records, he failed to qualify twice on the pistol range last year.
Abby get the results of the GSR tests on his clothing yet?
- All negative, boss.
- He could have worn gloves
- or got rid of the clothes he's wearing.
- But he leaves his pistol in full view on the front seat.
Boss, I think I've got something here.
I just spoke with the director of the Officers' Club.
Apparently Sun Porter was a regular fixture there.
Almost always with Min Crane.
A month ago, they were all banned.
- For what, McGee?
- One of their husbands showed up, made a scene, had to be carried out.
Another nail in Sergeant Porter's coffin.
It wasn't Sergeant Porter, Tony.
Sergeant James Dawson.
Yoon's husband.
Heard you guys got Sergeant Porter at the "E" Club with the murder weapon.
I knew they were having troubles, but never expected this.
Where's your wife, Sergeant Dawson?
She's taking a nap with our daughter.
Why?
is something wrong, sir?
What happened at the Officer's Club last month?
Let me refresh your memory.
You had an altercation with two Marine captains.
Yeah, it was nothing.
It was just a misunderstanding.
Big enough for a Letter of Reprimand in your SRB.
Maybe we should ask your wife about it, sergeant?
- She had a rough day. I'd rather not--
- Down the hall?
Yeah, but I'd rather not disturb her.
- We'll see if she's still breathing.
- You think I killed Sun and Min because they had a couple of drinks with my wife at the "O" Club?
Mrs. Dawson, NClS.
We're gonna ask you a few questions.
Yoon. lt's me.
Please.
Yoon, open up.
- Do you have a key?
- lt's locked from the inside.
Yoon.
Yoon.
It's okay. lt's okay.
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Someone kills my wife's two best friends, then they decide to kidnap her?
When's the last time you saw her, sergeant?
About an hour before you showed up.
She was putting the baby to sleep in our room.
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.
Can we stop standing around and do something?
We are.
We are.
Sit down.
And what exactly is that, sir?
Figuring out if you're a suspect or a victim.
The window was broken from the outside.
Whoever did this slipped in, grabbed her and slipped out.
None of the neighbours heard or saw anything unusual, boss.
MP's are searching the area.
Also checking every vehicle leaving the base.
- You think she still might be on base?
- lt's possible.
We need to be out there looking for her.
If she's still on base we'll find her.
Someone put a lot of effort into taking her away without alerting you.
There's a good chance she's not dead yet.
Yet?
Oh, God, why would someone do this?
For the same reason someone killed her friends.
You think I had something to do with this?
Sit down.
What happened at the Officer's Club, sergeant?
It was nothing, okay?
Sun and Min go there all the time.
Yoon just drops them off.
This one time she went in and had a couple of drinks.
She couldn't drive home so she called me.
- Gibbs.
- Boss--
When did you get into a verbal altercation with the Marine captains?
They were drunk, okay?
They were hitting on my wife.
They tried to stop me from taking her home.
What would you do, sir?
You think one of these captains might have had something to do with this?
We're wasting our time. I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with this.
I know that.
Your alibi just checked out.
The sergeant was on duty at the time of the shootings.
So what now, sir?
Three Korean women met and married Marines in Seoul at roughly the same time.
Two of them are dead.
Our prime suspect was locked up here when the third went missing.
Think it's a racial thing?
No.
Definitely do not think that it's a hate crime.
In my experience there's only one colour in the Marines.
What I've seen of your Marine Corps, it's very ethnically diverse.
He means green, Ziva.
And I think he's right.
Well, maybe it's a Korean thing.
Maybe something in their past.
Like some kind of blood feud.
Competing villages, ancient oaths, revenge from across the ocean.
This is not one of your stupid action movies, Tony.
No, it isn't.
If it was, you'd be dressed differently.
And you'd be far better looking.
You'd be dead by the opening credits.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe I am the plucky comic relief?
You find out what the hell happened to Yoon Dawson yet?
Plucky?
- Well, Ziva and Tony and l--
- Were just working on that, boss.
We're going through a list of anyone who had access to the base in the last two days.
So far, no solid leads.
What about the Marines Sergeant Dawson fought with?
Both transferred out of Quantico last month.
One at Camp Pendleton, the other is in Okinawa.
The two dead women lived insular lives.
They spent most of their time together with other Koreans.
Yoon Dawson seems to be the only one who embraced American life.
Any reason to believe that Sergeant Porter isn't still involved in this?
He could have had an accomplice, probie.
He could have had three, DiNozzo.
We need more information.
Actually, boss, Abby and I, we have been working on something.
We got the women's phone records, credit card receipts, address books.
Abby is referencing to see if there's a pattern.
DiNozzo, I want to know about anybody in the area who's made threats against Koreans, foreign Marine wives, or women.
Oh, is that all?
- On it, boss.
- Find out about their lives before they married Marines.
Come on, you're with me, Elf Lord.
It's amazing how much you can find out about someone without actually meeting them.
For instance, me and these women have absolutely nothing in common.
They web-browse for cake recipes, gardening tips and Min Crane has some weird obsession with stained glass.
That's not even mentioning their music downloads.
One word:
Yanni.
Good point.
Who cares?
Their schedules were pretty regulated.
On Wednesdays and Fridays they trekked to Koreatown.
They'd shop for a couple of hours, then they'd have tea at Lee's Neighbourhood Market.
They alternated paying.
It was Sun Porter's turn, by the way.
Not exactly groundbreaking police work there.
- She's not done yet, McGee.
- Thank you, Gibbs.
Within the last month, all three of them received regular phone calls from a pay phone located just outside Lee's Neighbourhood Market.
It is owned and operated by Lee Sung.
He sells Korean delicacies, fruits and vegetables and those cute little anime figurines with the funny faces.
Oh, I love those.
He also has a catering business, Lee's Delights.
It's authentic Korean food.
Very high end.
All three women have worked for him as hostesses and they were scheduled to work an event for him tomorrow afternoon.
- How do you know?
- Because.
Lee's Sung e-mailed them the instructions.
It's a Korean diplomatic event at the Pacific Rim Society.
Tell me I didn't just smack McGee for no good reason.
You didn't smack McGee for no good reason.
Last night, Yoon Dawson used her cell phone to call the pay phone outside Lee's Market.
Two hours later...she's missing.
Why is this important?
Because someone is still using her cell phone to call that pay phone.
- Can we get a fix on the phone?
- Negatory, McGee.
I know it's somewhere in Annandale, Virginia, but they turn it off before I can get an exact location.
The last phone call was an hour ago.
McGee, I want a tap on that damn pay phone.
Abby, I wanna know who answers it.
That's good work, Abs.
What was that for?
For mocking my groundbreaking police work.
I was not mocking you--
Won't happen again.
Damn, I can't believe this.
I don't really like waiting here either, Tony.
No, Nick and Jessica broke up.
I'm always the last to know.
Hey, DiNozzo.
- Shut up.
- Shutting up, boss.
Hey, probie, you getting this?
Yeah, got it, Tony.
It's Yoon Dawson's cell phone again.
I want a location, McGee.
Whoever it is, they disabled the onboard GPS chip.
We'll have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Just take a moment to get a bead on the cell phone grid it's interfacing with.
We got someone headed to the phone, boss.
- You want us to take him down now?
- Negative.
Wait until we trace the call.
Okay, I've got the cell phone grid located.
It's coming from this neighbourhood.
Somewhere on this street.
You copy that, DiNozzo?
Well, we're scanning for targets now.
There are a lot of possibles.
If you don't respond, I'm gonna hang up.
Don't, I have information for you.
Wool cap, head down, heading towards the pay phone.
Got him.
Drop your weapon.
Federal agents, move!
It's Yoon Dawson, boss.
She's rabitting.
We're cutting her off, DiNozzo.
I know she didn't pass us.
Well, where the hell did she go?
It's like she disappeared.
She didn't disappear.
It's her hat.
She climbed her way out.
If I am here, I answer the pay phone, Agent McGee.
Many people in this community are poor.
Can't afford phone service, so I take messages for them.
You see, it helps them and it is good for my business when they come to pick up.
Boss, did you find her?
Yeah, McGee.
She's hiding in my coffee cup.
We didn't find her.
Just give us one second, please.
Has he calmed down yet?
Well, he's a little shaky but I think he's ready to talk.
Min and Sun.
They are dead?
It's my fault.
I take responsibility.
I try to help people new to this country.
Find jobs for them, get them training, classes.
Sometimes even loan money.
You hired all three of them to work for your catering company?
I did.
I would notice when Yoon was tired, her accent would change.
Sometimes she would use words not common in my country since the war.
Yoon-Sook Dawson wasn't South Korean.
I began to believe that she was from the North.
Perhaps a spy?
Why didn't you go to the police?
Well, I couldn't be sure.
What if I was wrong?
I asked Min and Sun to find out where she grew up, what schools she go to.
Then I check her answers and try to locate relatives from Korea.
- Nothing.
- Who else knew
- you were checking up on her?
- Min Crane, Sun Porter and myself.
She was trying to protect her cover?
She failed.
We're taking you into protective custody, Mr. Sung.
No.
I will not hide.
- Mr. Sung, she could come back.
- Let her.
I am ready this time.
I won't stop living my life because of people like her.
- Sir, I really don't think that this--
- Mr. Sung.
Thank you for your help.
If you think of anything else, give me a call.
Yes, I will.
And please thank your agents for me.
Boss, you're not really gonna let him just--
McGee, you know the fbi does not exist only to piss me off.
Sometimes they can actually be useful.
Hey, Fornell.
I got one right up your jurisdiction.
Like my father always said, "Be careful who you marry, Anthony.
She may end up being a homicidal maniac."
- Your father actually said that to you?
- No, but I'm sure he thought it.
Probably he knew your taste in women.
Abby's got active taps on Sergeant Dawson's cell, home and work phones, boss.
- lf she calls her husband, we'll know.
- She won't.
The fbi team shadowing Mr. Sung is tied directly into MTAC.
They're last report had him loading up a catering truck for a job.
No sign of Yoon Dawson yet.
It's highly doubtful she'd make another attempt on his life.
We've got four agents providing surveillance on Dawson's house.
She definitely won't be returning home.
And how do you know this, Officer David?
Because Yoon Dawson wouldn't.
Now tell us what you'd do.
If I was Yoon, everything I've done up to this point was to protect my cover.
I've dealt with the two possible threats on base and-- lf by "dealt" you mean gunning down two defenceless housewives... I attempted to deal with the third, but my cover was blown.
I'm now only left with a few possibilities.
You rush back to your country?
Or carry out whatever mission I was assigned before I'm captured or killed.
She's been in the States for three years.
If you had a mission, wouldn't you have carried it out?
Not if I'm a sleeper, McGee.
She could be here for decades before being activated.
So tell us, Jane Bond, how do we track you down, huh?
You don't, Tony.
By now I've changed my appearance, I've replaced my identity with backup documents and I've relocated.
Promise?
Okay, so that about wraps it up.
Who's up for lunch?
You might think about this, I'm gonna pay.
No one's eating until we find Yoon Dawson.
It's not that Tony couldn't stand to lose a little weight but we'd all starve to death before that happened.
She's playing it like I would.
She's gone.
There's one difference between the two of you, Ziva.
You don't have a baby girl.
Most likely part of her cover or an occupational accident.
- lt's more than that.
- How can you tell?
My gut.
Come on.
You're with me.
Let's go.
Hey, probie.
Let me ask you a question.
You don't think she was serious about the whole losing a few pounds thing?
Are you gonna hit me if I tell you the truth?
No, man.
We're buds.
Yeah.
My wife is not a spy, sir.
Her South Korean passport's a forgery.
It's not possible, okay?
Yoon loves this country.
She knows more about it than me.
She was trained to, it's called a honey trap.
Her assignment was to meet an eligible serviceman, seduce him and gain access into this country.
Oh, yeah?
Then why was she trying to convince me to leave the Marine Corps and go to college?
Most likely you were not part of the assignment.
- You were a means to an end.
- Listen.
Okay, I've lived with her for five years.
She's the mother of my child.
I'm telling you, there's no way.
- What's this?
- Your wife.
No, that can't be real.
It's real.
Min Crane and Sun Porter?
She killed them?
- Oh, my God.
- Has she tried to contact you?
- No.
- She's a foreign agent, Marine.
You lie about this, it's treason.
She hasn't.
She hasn't tried to contact me, sir.
Okay, we think she might.
If she does and you confront her, she will most likely kill you.
I just can't believe this.
Go ahead.
- Hello?
- lt's me, James.
Yoon, what the hell is going on?
NClS is here.
- They're telling me all sorts of things.
- Don't speak.
Just listen to me, okay?
You need to come home now.
It's too late for that.
I've done things.
- Terrible things.
- l don't care, all right?
Tell me where you are and I'll come and get you.
There's one more thing that I need to do.
I don't have a choice.
- l never had a choice.
- Just tell me why.
- Please, sweetheart.
- No matter what they say, what they tell you about me, know that I loved you with all my heart.
That it was for real.
And tell Rebecca--
Tell her Mommy is sorry for this.
All of it.
This is insane.
Yoon, you can't do-- l love you both so much, more than you can imagine but I can't let it happen.
Yoon, don't.
Yoon, don't hang up.
I got her, Tony.
She's at a pay phone in Annandale, Virginia.
The corner of Raven Road and Lancaster Drive.
- Way to go, Abs.
- Kind of a weird place to be hiding out.
There's nothing there except country clubs.
Lee Sung's catering job?
The Pacific Rim Society.
It's in Annandale!
Either that's a coincidence or she really, really wants to kill this guy.
- l don't believe in coincidence.
- "l don't believe in coincidence."
No.
No, Yoon.
Where is it, Lee Sung?
Have you no honour left, woman?
More than you.
Scream and I kill you.
Found out why the fbi isn't responding, boss.
- She's definitely here.
- Keep looking, DiNozzo.
I'm right behind you.
I will kill you if you don't answer this time.
Where?
In the truck.
Drop the weapon.
There's a bomb set to go off in this building.
If you kill me now, we all die.
Put your weapon down.
I was a North Korean operative.
We kind of figured that part out on our own.
The part that you don't know is that my cell included Sun Porter,
- Min Crane and this man.
- She's lying.
I swear on the life of my daughter that I'm trying to prevent this attack.
And I swear if you don't release your weapon, I will kill you.
The bomb is in his truck.
Please, we may only have minutes left.
- Now do you believe me?
- Can you disarm it?
If I had a couple of days, maybe.
You?
I could try.
But I suggest not standing within five miles of here while I attempt it.
- l can.
- She put it there.
She's trying to kill us all.
They're evacuating the building, boss.
And the--
- That's a really big bomb.
- You think, DiNozzo?
I didn't kill them to maintain my cover, Agent Gibbs.
I did it to keep my family.
- l failed.
- She's a North Korean spy.
Not anymore.
At least let me prevent this.
McGee, get Sung out of here.
- Get the cuffs off her.
- Gibbs.
It's not a debate, Officer David.
Go.
Go on.
Get out of here.
All of you.
Get a clear distance away.
I'll handle it from here.
I don't care how hard you whack me, boss.
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Nor am I.
If we survive this, you're both fired.
It's supposed to do that, right?
It's done.
The bomb is no longer armed.
So what happens now, sir?
The fbi will take her into custody, sergeant.
And then prison?
Your wife is an agent of a hostile power.
It all depends what kind of a deal she can make.
She was also responsible for bringing down an entire North Korean cell and saving hundreds of lives, sergeant.
I'm sure that will be taken into consideration.
Right, Officer David?
Yes, of course.
Her knowledge of the inner workings of North Korean intelligence should proved to be invaluable.
Guys, give her a minute.
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to do the right thing.
Everything you said to me on the phone, I believe in you.
I'll always believe it, no matter what happens.
Come here.
It's okay.
- l'm so sorry.
- l know.
Let's go.
Tony,
Ziva, what happened back there with the bomb,
- l want you both to know--
- You don't have to say it, boss.
We know how you feel about us.
Gibbs, we're a team.
That's what we do.
I was going to say, if either one of you two wing nuts ever disobey a direct order again, I'll kill you myself.
That's our boss.
Okay.
What an adorable child, Yoon.
She's like a little doll.
How come I have never met this little munchkin before?
She usually stays with the sitter when we go shopping, Mrs. Goodwin.
She's such a cutie.
Uh, well, we're running a little late today, so if you'll excuse us.
Oh, here, let me help you, dear.
-Oh, thank you.
-Sure.
I doubt they'll hear us.
They've been playing that Chinese stuff all morning.
Actually, it's Korean.
Oh, right.
Sorry.
You know, Sun usually leaves the back door open.
Come on.
My aunt burned down her house like this.
She really should be more careful.
Oh, now that's better.
I'm not usually one to complain...
I don't understand, McGee.
Sensitivity training?
Yes.
A seminar covering the basics of communication and understanding in the workplace.
I know what sensitivity is.
I'm asking why we have to spend the whole afternoon studying it.
Professional development?
If it were survival training, advanced demolitions, perhaps...
I don't think that Sympathetic Seminars, Inc. offers those classes.
I'm simply saying that skilled investigators should already be well-versed in the subtleties of inter-human communication.
I like Italian women.
You're Italian, right?
I like Irish women, too.
I stand corrected.
You two better hurry up.
Don't want to miss out on all the fun.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?
Prior engagement.
Take notes for me.
You do understand the meaning of the word "mandatory," don't you?
I've been ordered to inspect the Secure File Room, probie.
Sadly, that conflicts with your exciting seminar today.
No, it doesn't.
This order's for next Wednesday.
What?
Look on the bright side, Tony.
It should only take about five to seven hours.
There's got to be some way out of this.
Maybe I could injure myself.
What?
I was only trying to help.
I was only kidding.
Sensitivity training's going to have to wait.
Got a double homicide at Quantico.
Marine wives.
Grab your gear.
Yes!
Inappropriate?
A bit.
That and you're probably the reason we have to take these stupid classes.
Today!
On your six, boss.
You know this kind of reminds me of my cousin's house.
Minus all the blood.
Unless you count that Thanksgiving back in '98.
Family does have a way of fraying one's nerves.
Take my mother, for instance.
She insists on watching Jeopardy every night on the television.
What's wrong with that, Duck?
Well, the same episode over and over again?
I made the mistake of taping it for her once.
I always say, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your family.
There's a touch of the poet in you, Mr. Palmer.
I'd say you're just more touched.
DiNozzo?
House belongs to a Sergeant Malcolm Porter and his wife Sun, boss.
She's the one on the left.
The sergeant's still on liberty.
We're trying to track him down.
The other vic is Min Crane.
She's married to a Sergeant Floyd Crane, currently deployed in Iraq.
Sign of an unhappy marriage.
Funny, I thought it looked like a hole in the wall.
It's about fist size.
The husband probably hit the wall instead of hitting his wife.
What else do you see?
Well, judging by the positioning of the body,
I'd say they were taken by surprise.
Yeah?
Why?
Body posture they're too relaxed.
They didn't fight back.
Of course, that could also mean they knew the identity of their attacker.
Search the rest of the house.
The little girl's becoming quite the crime scene investigator, isn't she, boss?
I'll go help McGee talk to the women who found them.
Got a T.O.D. yet, Duck?
Very recent.
Both liver probes indicate about two and a half hours ago.
Triple tap, all in the heart.
Yeah, but notice these burn marks around the entry wounds here, and on this one.
In both of those, the weapon was in direct contact with the body when fired.
Two from across the room.
Then one each up close, just to be sure.
I don't believe the term "overkill"
would be inappropriate under these circumstances.
Bullets didn't penetrate.
Maybe they were small caliber.
Did you find any casings?
Aah.
Shooter policed his brass, Duck.
"Policed," sir?
Military terminology for cleaning up after one's self.
We may be dealing with a professional.
Professional what?
Killer, Mr. Palmer.
These poor women weren't so much murdered as executed.
She just needs her bottle.
I know I packed it.
Look, look, look, your mom's right there.
Right there.
You ever hold a baby before, McGee?
No.
I didn't think so.
Shh.
Uh, boss, this is Mrs. Dawson.
She found the body along with the next-door neighbors.
We were going into Koreatown shopping.
I'm the only one with a car.
Sun asked me to come pick them up.
If we'd been on time...
You need some help?
There you go.
Do you have any idea where Sun's husband is, Mrs. Dawson?
No.
He's never here when we come over.
I don't think he likes Sun having friends.
What makes you think that?
He's very controlling.
Sergeant Porter abused her?
Sun wouldn't admit it, but we suspect it.
He drinks.
Says mean things to her.
Wouldn't let her speak Korean in the house.
We tried to reason with her, but...
She wouldn't leave him?
She was ashamed.
It's hard for a Korean woman to ask for help.
Find Porter.
I'd start at the "E" Club.
James.
I'm Yoon's husband.
Listen, if you don't find Porter there, you might want to check some of the bars outside the front gate.
I'm on it, boss.
Everything's going to be okay now, honey, okay?
Gibbs, a word please?
I just talked to her a few hours ago.
Gun safe.
I found it in the master bedroom, open and empty, except for a handful of shells--
.40 caliber.
I'm thinking maybe the husband did this, yes?
I guess the polite term, Agent DiNozzo, would be "bastard."
He was always borrowing my husband's tools, and never returning them.
I should have known something like this would happen.
Stealing tools isn't really a prerequisite for murder, Mrs. Goodwin.
All I'm saying is, the two of them had one hell of a marriage.
You wouldn't know it to look at her, but Sun's got a set of lungs.
Or at least she did.
So they fought a lot?
Oh, hardly a night went by, you didn't hear all sorts of screaming coming from this house.
You ever think to make a complaint?
I don't like to stick my nose in.
Good thing, too.
It could have been me that got slaughtered.
On our way, McGee.
Sergeant Porter was spotted 30 minutes ago at the "E" club.
McGee's almost there.
Thanks.
Probie's not going to make a move on his own, is he, boss?
McGee can take care of himself, DiNozzo.
You're on the hump.
He's gone.
Nice job, probie.
Bartender says he turned around, Sergeant Porter wasn't there anymore.
You let him get past you?
It was before I got here, Tony.
What's Sergeant Porter driving?
What kind of car does he drive?
!
Black 2000 Ford F-150, boss.
Hey, come on.
Boss, we got a weapon in the front seat.
Think he's dead, boss.
NCIS!
Don't move!
Get your hands on the wheel!
Hey, I wasn't gonna drive.
Come on, it's not a DUI if I don't have the key in the ignition!
What's he talking about?
I think he thinks we're busting him for driving drunk.
Well, you're not?
No.
It's for double homicide.
McGee?
Wait a minute.
I knew he was alive.
Precision, Mr. Palmer.
It's what separates the professional from the dilettante.
Thank you, Doctor.
Mm.
Now, careful.
Not too much pressure.
But not too little, either.
Huh?
All right, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Oh, let's see.
Yes, very good.
Ah, not bad, not bad at all.
Yeah, but keep a steady hand.
There's no room for error.
You never know which element of the enigma, however miniscule, can lead you to the solution.
Palmer just got some of your elements on his plastic thing.
Occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
What can you tell me, Duck?
Both women were shot three times in the chest.
It's hard to say which of these six was the fatal wound.
Suffice it to say, neither woman died of old age.
Anything else?
Yes.
Mrs. Porter has some swelling and fissures on her fingers and knuckles.
Defensive wounds.
Possibly.
Yeah, but these didn't happen today.
There are also bruises on her wrists.
I'd say they were at least a week old.
She was abused?
Yeah.
Thanks, Duck.
Do you have the man in custody now?
Yeah.
Well, there's no need to be gentle with him, Jethro.
SYNC
You missed a spot.
We're looking at a Beretta Cougar 80-40, Gibbs.
It was registered to Sergeant Porter in 2003, and it's got his fingerprints all over it.
Bullets?
Um, cross-point, 40-caliber,
Smith and Wesson.
Also called a Short and Wimpy, although I do not know why.
They lack the power of ten-millimeter auto-load.
Yeah, I guess you don't need a lot of stopping power when you're gunning down housewives.
How about gunshot residue?
The Instant Shooter Kit came back negative on Porter's skin, shirt and pants.
Could've worn gloves, or...
Of he could have changed his clothes.
I'm way ahead of you, Gibbs.
That's why I'm doing a full analysis on all of Porter's wardrobe.
How long, Abby?
Well, it's gonna take some time, and some stuff doesn't smell very good.
I don't think that laundry was a big priority.
Abs!
Um, two hours?
Whenever I know something, you'll know something.
You got one.
Anything else?
Yes, as a matter of fact.
This is for you.
Why?
For getting me out of sensitivity training.
We were about to do trust falls, and those guys in administration have wandering hands.
Just give me their names, Abs, and I'll break them for you.
I know you will, Gibbs, and that is why I love you.
Ooh!
Uh, boss, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.
What'd I say about apologizing, McGee?
A sign of weakness.
So is barfing on your tie.
Well, no, this-this isn't mine.
Um...
We've got Sergeant Porter in Interrogation.
I actually managed to dodge most of it.
The good news is that he is, uh, sober enough to talk now.
Oh, I got some on you.
Here, let me get this.
Don't.
Sorry.
I mean, it won't happen again.
Who's watching him?
Uh, Tony and Ziva.
I was actually just gonna go change my shirt.
No, you won't.
You're gonna follow up on other leads.
We found Sergeant Porter with the murder weapon.
What other leads?
A good investigator doesn't sit back and wait.
You run down every angle, every lead.
Assume everything you've been told is a lie until it checks out.
You got it.
There's only one time I want you to stop, McGee.
When you tell me.
When you're satisfied.
When you're satisfied.
Okay.
Hey!
Yeah?
Get me another cup of coffee.
SYNC
This is gonna be good.
Gibbs'll rip this guy apart.
I don't know if that's the right tactic in this case, Tony.
What, are you an expert on suspect interviews now?
Interviews, no.
Interrogation techniques, yes.
Hmm.
Like hooking a car battery up to a guy's privates?
I'm sure it's effective, but judges tend to frown on it.
I've learned from Gibbs that in certain cases, you can attract far more bees with honey.
Flies.
What do flies have to do with honey?
Flies don't like, uh, vinegar.
Vinegar?
It's complicated.
Here he comes.
Here you go.
There.
You look like you could use it.
My wife's really dead, sir?
How?
Drink your coffee, Sergeant.
When you're ready, we'll work our way up to it.
What's he doing?
Where's the strong-arming?
The intimidation?
The psychological bullying?
The Gibbs?
All right, I'm ready.
Bad marriage, huh?
It's okay.
I've had a few myself.
It wasn't perfect, but I loved her, sir.
Problem was...
I don't think, uh...
I don't think she ever loved me.
Bet she loved that paycheck, though, right?
Yeah.
I should have known.
Just look at me.
She was way out of my league, you know?
She just married me to get to the States.
It happens.
SYNC
Thing is,
I guess I-I always thought she might change her mind, you know?
Then she started sneaking out to the "O" Club, hanging out with officers.
I've seen it before.
She thought she could trade up.
She didn't want me, no matter what I did.
Just got to the point that
I just wanted her to disappear.
Yeah.
Well, you get pushed, you want to push back.
That why you decided to blow her away?
Excuse me, sir?
Is that the reason you shot Min Crane and your wife to death today?
Okay, here we go.
He hasn't confessed yet.
He will.
Maybe.
How much do you want to bet?
How about nothing?
20 bucks?
Deal.
I'm telling you,
I-I didn't kill them, sir.
The murder weapon was in your truck, Sergeant.
Someone must have...
someone must have put it there.
Your fingerprints are all over it.
I didn't shoot my wife, sir.
Did you use your fists on her, Sergeant?
Knock her around a little bit, or maybe... maybe that just wasn't cutting it anymore.
I never laid a hand on Sun.
Your neighbor heard the fights, Sergeant.
I saw the hole you punched in your wall.
I only punched the hole in the wall so I wouldn't hit her, sir.
Her hands were all bruised and cut from where she fought you off all the time.
That's-That's not how it happened, sir.
Really?
Then how'd I get it wrong, Sergeant?
How'd it happen?
She was the...
She was the one who was abusing me.
You don't believe me.
Take a look at this.
Sit down.
Sun was violent, sir.
She hit me.
She called me names.
She threw things.
I tried to hold her off, but I never...
I never once laid a hand on her.
I just wanted it to stop.
Pay up?
He didn't confess.
It was damn close.
Close doesn't cut it, DiNozzo.
Well, we got enough evidence even if you didn't break himin interrogation, boss.
Not to say that you couldn't have broken him, if you wanted to.
I really like that shirt.
Tony's right.
We have Sergeant Porter's gun with his fingerprints in his car.
He blows away his wife and her friend in a fit of rage.
Gets drunk, passes out before he can commit suicide.
Why did he police his brass?
Habit of a well-trained Marine.
He worked the motor pool.
According to his records, he failed to qualify twice on the pistol range last year.
Abby get the results of the GSR tests on his clothing yet?
All negative, boss.
He could have worn gloves or gotten rid of the clothes he was wearing.
But he leaves his pistol in full view on the front seat.
Boss, I think I got something here.
Just spoke with the Director of the Quantico Officers' Club.
Apparently, Sun Porter was a regular fixture there.
Almost always with Min Crane.
A month ago, they were all banned.
For what, McGee?
Uh, one of their husbands showed up, made a scene.
Had to be carried out.
Another nail in Sergeant Porter's coffin.
It wasn't Sergeant Porter, Tony.
It was Sergeant James Dawson.
Yoon's husband.
Heard you guys got Sergeant Porter at the "E" Club with the murder weapon.
I knew they were having troubles, but never expected something like this.
Where's your wife, Sergeant Dawson?
She's taking a nap with our daughter.
Why?
Is something wrong, sir?
What happened at the Officers' Club last month?
Let me refresh your memory.
You got into an altercation with two Marine captains.
Yeah.
It was nothing.
It was just a misunderstanding.
Big enough for a letter of reprimand in your SRB.
Maybe we should ask your wife about it, Sergeant.
She's had a really rough day.
I'd rather not disturb her.
Bedroom down the hall?
Yeah, it is, but I'd rather not disturb her.
We're just gonna make sure she's still breathing.
What, you think I'd kill Sun and Min 'cause they had a couple of drinks with my wife at the "O" Club?
Mrs. Dawson?
NCIS.
We have a few questions?
Yoon, it's me.
Please.
Yoon, open up?
You have a key?
It's locked from the inside.
Yoon!
Yoon!
Hush now.
It's okay.
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Someone kills my wife's two best friends, then they decide to kidnap her?
When's the last time you saw her, Sergeant?
About an hour before you showed up.
She was putting the baby to sleep in our room.
You didn't hear anything?
No.
Can we stop standing around and do something?
We are.
We are.
Sit down.
And what exactly is that, sir?
Figuring out if you're a suspect or a victim.
The window was broken from the outside.
Whoever did this slipped in, grabbed her and slipped out.
None of the neighbors heard or saw anything unusual, boss.
MPs are searching the area.
They're also checking every vehicle leaving the base.
You think she still might be on base?
It's possible.
Then we need to be out there looking for her.
If she's still on base, we'll find her.
Someone put a lot effort into taking her away from your home without alerting you, Sergeant.
There's a good chance she's not dead yet.
Yet?
God, why would someone do this?
Maybe for the same reason someone killed her friends.
You think I had something to do with this?
Sit down.
What happened at the Officers' Club, Sergeant?
It was nothing, okay?
Sun and Min go there all the time.
Yoon just drops them off.
This one time she went in and had a couple of drinks.
She couldn't drive home, so she called me.
Gibbs.
At which point did you get into a verbal altercation with the two Marine captains?
They were drunk, okay?
They were hitting on my wife.
They tried to stop me from taking her home.
What would you do, sir?
You think one of these captains might have had something to do with this?
Look, we're wasting our time!
I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with this!
I know that.
Your alibi just checked out.
The sergeant was on duty at the time of the shootings.
So what now, sir?
Three Korean women met and married Marines in Seoul at roughly the same time.
Two of them are dead.
Our prime suspect was locked up here when the third went missing.
Think it's a racial thing?
No, definitely do not think that it's a hate crime.
In my experience, there's only one color in the Marines.
From what I've seen of your Marine Corps, it's very ethnically diverse.
He means green, Ziva, and I think he's right.
You know, maybe it's a Korean thing.
Maybe something in their past.
Ooh, like some kind of blood feud-- competing villages, ancient oaths, revenge from across the ocean.
This is not one of your stupid action movies, Tony.
No, it isn't.
If it was, you'd be dressed differently.
And you'd be far better looking.
You'd be dead by the opening credits.
You ever stop to think that maybe I am the plucky comic relief?
You find out what the hell happened to Yoon Dawson yet?
"Plucky"?
Um, well...
Ziva and Tony and I...
We're just working on that, boss.
We're going through a list of anyone suspicious who had access to the base in the last two days.
So far, no solid leads.
What about the Marine captains Sergeant Dawson fought with?
Both transferred out of Quantico last month.
One is at Camp Pendleton, the other is in Okinawa.
The two dead women lived insular lives.
They spent most of their time together or with other Koreans.
Yoon Dawson seems to be the only one who embraced American life.
Any reason to believe that Sergeant Porter isn't still involved in this?
He could have had an accomplice, probie.
Could have had three, DiNozzo.
We need more information.
Actually, boss, Abby and I, we have been working on something.
We gathered the women's phone records, credit card receipts, address books.
Abby is cross-referencing to see if there's a pattern.
DiNozzo, I want to know about anybody in the area who's made threats against Koreans, foreign Marine wives or women.
Oh, is that all?
On it, boss.
Find out about their lives before they married Marines.
Come on.
You're with me, elf lord.
It's amazing how much you can find out about someone without actually meeting them.
For instance, me and these three women have absolutely nothing in common.
They web-browse for cake recipes, gardening tips, and Min Crane has some weird obsession with stained glass.
That's not even mentioning their music downloads.
One word:
Yanni.
Good point.
Who cares?
Their schedules were pretty regulated.
On Wednesdays and Fridays they trekked to Korea Town.
They would shop for a couple hours, then they would have tea at Lee's Neighborhood Market.
They alternated paying.
It was Sun Porter's turn, by the way.
Yeah, not exactly groundbreaking police work there.
She's not done yet, McGee.
Thank you, Gibbs.
Within the last month, all three of them received regular phone calls from a pay phone located just outside Lee's Neighborhood Market.
It is owned and operated by Lee Sung.
He sells Korean delicacies, fruits and vegetables, and those cute little animee figurines with the funny faces.
Oh, I love those.
Um...
He also has a catering business, Lee's Delights.
It's authentic Korean food, very high-end.
All three women have worked for him as hostesses, and they were scheduled to work an event for him tomorrow afternoon.
How do you know?
Because Lee Sung e-mailed them the instructions.
It's a Korean diplomatic event at the Pacific Rim Society.
Tell me I didn't just smack McGee for no good reason.
You didn't smack McGee for no good reason.
Last night, Yoon Dawson used her cell phone to call the pay phone outside Lee's Market.
Two hours later, bam-- she's missing.
Why is this important?
Because someone is still using her cell phone to call that pay phone.
Can we get a fix on the phone?
Negatory, McGee.
I know it's somewhere in Annandale, Virginia, but they turn it off before I can get an exact location.
The last phone call was an hour ago.
McGee, I want a tap on that damn pay phone.
Abby, I want to know who answers it.
SYNC
That's good work, Abs.
Ow.
What was that for?
For mocking my groundbreaking police work.
I was not mocking your...
Won't happen again.
Damn, I can't believe this.
ZIVA:
I don't really like waiting here either, Tony.
No.
Nick and Jessica broke up.
I'm always the last to know.
Hey, DiNozzo.
Shut up.
Shutting up, boss.
Probie, you getting this?
Yeah, got it, Tony.
It's Yoon Dawson's cell phone again, boss.
I want a location, McGee.
Whoever it is, they disabled the onboard GPS chip.
We're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Just take a moment to get a bead on the cell phone grid it's interfacing with.
We got someone headed to the phone, boss.
Want us to take him down now?
Negative.
Wait until we trace the call.
Okay, I've got the cell phone grid located.
It's coming from this neighborhood, somewhere on this street.
You copy that, DiNozzo?
We're scanning for targets now, a lot of possibles.
If you don't respond, I'm going to hang up.
Don't.
I have information for you.
Wool cap, head down, heading towards the pay phone.
Got him.
Drop your weapon!
Federal Agents!
Move!
It's Yoon Dawson, boss!
She's rabbiting.
We're cutting her off, DiNozo.
She didn't pass us.
Well, where the hell did she go?
It's like she disappeared.
She didn't disappear.
It's her hat.
She climbed her way out.
If I am here, I answer the pay phone, Agent McGee.
Many people in this community are poor, can't afford phone service.
So I take messages for them.
You see?
It helps them and it is good for my business when they come to pick up.
Boss, did you find her?
Yeah, McGee, she's hiding in my coffee cup.
Uh, we didn't find her.
Just give us one second please.
Has he calmed down yet?
Well, he's a little shaky, but I think he's ready to talk.
Min and Sun, they are dead?
It's my fault.
I take responsibility.
I try to help people new to this country.
Find jobs for them, get them training, classes, sometimes even loan money.
You hired all three of them to work for your catering company?
I did.
I would notice when Yoon was tired, her accent would change.
Sometimes she would use words not common in my country since the war.
Yoon-Sook Dawson wasn't South Korean.
I began to believe that she was from the North.
Perhaps a spy?
Why didn't you go to the police?
Well, I couldn't be sure.
What if I was wrong?
I asked Min and Sun to find out where she grew up, what schools she go to.
Then I check her answers and try to locate relatives from Korea.
Nothing.
Who else knew you were checking up on her?
Just Min Crane, Sun Porter and myself.
She was trying to protect her cover.
She failed.
We're taking you into protective custody, Mr. Sung.
No.
I will not hide.
Mr. Sung, she could come back.
Let her.
I am ready this time.
I won't stop living my life because of people like her.
Sir, I really don't think that's a...
Mr. Sung, thank you for your help.
You think of anything else, you give me a call.
Yes, I will.
And please, thank your agents for me.
Boss, you're not really gonna let him just...
McGee, you know, the FBI does not exist solely to piss me off.
Sometimes, they can actually be useful.
Hey, Fornell.
I got one right up your jurisdiction.
Like my father always said, be careful who you marry, Anthony, she may end up being a homicidal maniac.
Your father actually said that to you?
No, but I'm pretty sure he thought it.
Probably he knew your taste in women.
Abby's got active taps on Sergeant Dawson's cell, home and work phones, boss.
She calls her husband again, we'll know it.
She won't.
The FBI team shadowing Mr. Sung is tied directly into MTAC.
Their last report had him loading up a catering truck for a job.
No sign of Yoon Dawson yet.
It's highly doubtful she'd make another attempt on his life.
We've got four agents providing surveillance on Dawson's house...
She definitely won't be returning home.
And how do you know this, Officer David?
Because Yoon Dawson wouldn't.
Tell us what you would do.
If I was Yoon, everything I've done up to this point was to protect my cover.
I dealt with the two possible threats on base and...
If by dealt you mean gunning down two defenseless housewives.
And I attempted to deal with the third, but my cover was blown.
I'm now only left with a few possibilities.
Egress back to your country.
Or, carry out whatever mission I was assigned before I'm captured or killed.
She's been in the States for three years.
If you had a mission wouldn't you have carried it out by now?
Not if I'm a sleeper, McGee.
She could be here for decades before being activated.
So tell us, Jane Bond, how do we track you down, huh?
You don't, Tony.
By now, I've changed my appearance,
I've replaced my identity with backup documents, and I've relocated.
Promise?
Okay, so that about wraps it up.
Who's up for lunch?
You might want to think about this, boss, 'cause I'm gonna pay.
No one's eating.
until we find Yoon Dawson.
Gibbs, not that Tony couldn't stand to lose a little weight, but we'd all starve to death before that happened.
She's playing it like I would.
She's gone.
There's one big difference between the two of you, Ziva.
You don't have a baby girl.
Most likely part of her cover or an occupational accident.
It's more than that.
How can you tell?
My gut.
Come on.
You're with me.
Let's go.
Hey, Probie, let me ask you a question.
Mm.
You don't think she was serious about the whole losing a few pounds thing, do you?
You're gonna hit me if I tell you the truth?
No, man.
We're buds.
Yeah.
My wife is not a spy, sir.
Her South Korean passport's a forgery.
It's not possible.
Okay, Yoon loves this country.
She knows more about it than I do.
She was trained to;
it's called a honey trap.
Her assignment was to meet an eligible serviceman, seduce him, and gain access into this country.
Oh, yeah?
Then why was she trying to convince me to leave the Marine Corps and go back to college?
Most likely, you were not part of the assignment.
You were just a means to an end.
Listen, okay, I've lived with her for five years.
She's the mother of my child, for God's sake!
I'm telling you, there's no way.
Wha-What's this?
Your wife.
No.
That-That can't be real.
It's real.
Min Crane and Sun Porter?
She killed them?
Oh, my God.
Has she tried to contact you?
No.
She's a foreign agent, Marine.
You lie about this, it's treason.
She hasn't.
She hasn't tried to contact me, sir.
Okay.
We think she might.
If she does, and you confront her, she'll most likely kill you.
I just...
I just can't believe this.
Go ahead.
Hello?
It's me, James.
Yoon, what the hell is going on?
NCIS is here, and they're telling me all sorts of things.
Don't speak.
Just listen to me, okay?
You need to come home now.
It's too late for that.
I've done things, terrible things.
I don't care, all right?
Just tell me where you are, and I'll come and get you.
There's one more thing that I need to do.
I don't have a choice.
I never had a choice.
Just tell me why.
Please, sweetheart.
No matter what they say, what they tell you about me, know that I loved you with all my heart.
That it was for real.
And tell Rebecca... tell her Mommy is sorry for this, all of it.
This is insane.
Yoon, you-you can't...
I love you both so much more than you can imagine, but I can't let it happen.
Yoon, don't-don't-don't...
Yoon, don't hang up.
I got her, Tony!
She's at a pay phone in Annandale, Virginia.
The corner of Raven Road and Lancaster Drive.
Way to go, Abs.
It's kind of a weird place to be hiding out.
There's nothing there except country clubs.
Lee Sung's catering job.
The Pacific Rim Society.
It's in Annandale.
Either that's a coincidence, or she really, really wants to kill this guy.
I don't believe in coincidence.
No.
No, Yoon.
Where is it, Lee Sung?
!
Have you no honor left, woman?
More than you.
Scream... and I kill you.
Found out why the FBI isn't responding, boss.
She's definitely here.
Keep looking, DiNozzo.
I'm right behind you.
I will kill you if you don't answer this time.
Where?
!
In-In the truck.
Drop the weapon.
There's a bomb set to go off in this building.
If you kill me now, we all die.
Put your weapon down.
I was a North Korean operative.
We kind of figured that part out on our own.
The part that you don't know is that my cell included Sun Porter,
Min Crane, and this man.
She's lying.
I swear on the life of my daughter that I'm trying to prevent this attack.
And I swear, if you don't release your weapon,
I will kill you.
The bomb is in his truck.
Please.
We may have only minutes left.
Now do you believe me?
Can you disarm it?
If I had a couple of days, maybe.
You?
I could try.
But I suggest not standing within five miles of here while I attempt it.
I can.
She put it there.
She's trying to kill us all.
They're evacuating the building, boss.
And, the, uh...
Oh.
That's a really big bomb.
You think, DiNozzo?
I didn't kill them to maintain my cover, Agent Gibbs.
I did it to keep my family.
I failed.
She's a North Korean spy!
Not anymore.
At least let me prevent this.
McGee, get Sung out of here.
Get the cuffs off her.
Gibbs?
!
This isn't a debate, Officer David!
Go!
Let's go, come on.
GIBBS:
Go on!
Get out of here, all of you.
Get to clear distance away.
I'll handle it from here.
I don't care how hard you whack me, boss.
I'm not going anywhere.
Nor am I.
If we survive this, you're both fired.
It's supposed to do that, right?
It's done.
The bomb is no longer armed.
So, what happens now, sir?
The FBI will take her into custody,
Sergeant.
And then prison?
Your wife is an agent of a hostile power.
It all depends on what kind of deal she can make.
She was also responsible for bringing down an entire
North Korean cell and saving hundreds of lives, Sergeant.
I'm sure that will be take into consideration.
Right, Officer David?
Yes, of course.
Her knowledge of the inner workings of North Korean intelligence should prove to be invaluable.
Guys, give her a minute.
I'm... so sorry.
I was trying to do the right thing.
Everything you said to me on the phone?
I believe it, Yoon.
I'll always believe it, no matter what happens.
Come here.
It's okay.
I'm so sorry.
I know.
Let's go.
Yeah, Tony, Ziva, what happened back there with the bomb--
I want you both to know...
You don't have to say it, boss.
We know how you feel about us.
Gibbs, we're a team.
That's what we do.
I was going to say, if either one of you two wing nuts ever disobey a direct order again, I'll kill you myself.
That's our boss.
What an adorable child, Yoon.
She's like a little doll.
How come I have never met this little munchkin before?
She usually stays with the sitter while we go shopping.
She's such a cutie.
Well, we're running a little late today, so if you'll excuse us.
Oh, here, let me help you, dear.
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.
I doubt they'll hear us.
They've been playing that Chinese stuff all morning.
Actually, it's Korean.
Oh, right, sorry.
You know, Sun usually leaves the back door open.
Come on.
My aunt burned down her house like this.
She really should be more careful.
Oh, now that's better.
I'm not usually one to complain.
I don't understand, McGee.
Sensitivity training?
A seminar on the basics of communication
- and understanding in the workplace.
- l know what sensitivity is.
I'm asking why we have to spend the whole afternoon studying it.
Professional development?
If it were survival training, advanced demolitions, perhaps-- l don't think that Sympathetic Seminars, lnc. offers those classes
Skilled investigators should already be well-versed in the subtleties
- of inter-human communication.
- l like Italian women.
You're Italian, right?
I like Irish women, too.
- l stand corrected.
- You two better hurry up.
- You don't wanna miss out on the fun.
- Where are you going?
Prior engagement.
Take notes for me.
You do understand the meaning of the word "mandatory," don't you?
I have been ordered to inspect the secure-file room, probie.
Sadly, that conflicts with your exciting seminar today.
No, it doesn't.
This order is for next Wednesday.
- What?
- Look on the bright side, Tony.
It should only take about five to seven hours.
There's gotta be some way out of this.
Maybe I could injure myself.
- What?
I was only trying to help.
- l was only kidding.
Sensitivity training is gonna have to wait.
We got a double homicide at Quantico.
Marine wives.
Grab your gear.
Yes.
- lnappropriate?
- A bit.
You're probably the reason we have to take these classes.
- Today.
- On your six, boss.
You know, this kind of reminds me of my cousin's house, minus all the blood.
Unless you count that Thanksgiving back in '98.
Family does have a way of fraying one's nerves.
Take my mother, for instance.
She insists on watching Jeopardy every night on the television.
What's wrong with that, Duck?
The same episode, over and over again.
I made the mistake of taping it for her once.
I always say, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your family.
There's a touch of the poet in you, Mr. Palmer.
I'd say you're just more touched.
DiNozzo.
House belongs to a Sergeant Malcolm Porter and his wife, Sun, boss.
She's the one on the left.
Sergeant's still on liberty trying to track him down.
The other vic is Min Crane.
She's married to a Sergeant Floyd Crane, currently deployed in Iraq.
Sign of an unhappy marriage.
Funny, I thought it looked like a hole in the wall.
It's about fist size.
Husband probably hit the wall instead of hitting his wife.
- What else do you see?
- Judging by the position of the body
- l'd say they were taken by surprise.
- Yeah?
Why?
Body posture.
They're too relaxed.
They didn't fight back.
That could also mean they knew the identity of their attacker.
Search the rest of the house.
Little girl's becoming quite the crime scene investigator, isn't she, boss?
I'll go help McGee talk to the women who found them.
- You got a TOD yet, Duck?
- Very recent.
Both liver probes indicate about two and a half hours ago.
Triple tap, all in the heart.
Yeah, but notice these burn marks around the entry wounds here and on this one.
So both of those, the weapon was in direct contact with the body
- when fired.
- Two from across the room.
Then one each up close, just to be sure.
I don't believe the term "overkill"
would be inappropriate, under these circumstances.
- Bullets didn't penetrate.
- Maybe they were small-calibre.
Did you find any casings?
The shooter policed his brass, Duck.
Policed, sir?
Yes, it's military terminology for cleaning up after one's self.
We may be dealing with a professional.
- Professional what?
- Killer, Mr. Palmer.
These poor women weren't so much murdered as executed.
She just needs her bottle.
I know I packed it.
Look, look, look.
Your mom's right there.
She's right there.
Did you ever hold a baby before, McGee?
- No.
- l didn't think so.
Boss, this is Mrs. Dawson.
She found the body along with the next-door neighbours.
We were going into Koreatown, shopping.
I'm the only one with a car.
Sun asked me to come pick them up.
If we'd been on time--
You need some help?
Any idea where Sun's husband is, Mrs. Dawson?
No, he's never here when we come over.
I don't think he likes Sun having friends.
What makes you think that?
He's very controlling.
- Sergeant Porter abused her?
- Sun wouldn't admit it.
But we suspected.
He drinks.
Says mean things to her.
Wouldn't let her speak Korean in the house.
We tried to reason with her but--
- She wouldn't leave him?
- She was ashamed.
It's hard for a Korean woman to ask for help.
- Find Porter.
- l'd start at the "E" Club.
- James.
- l'm Yoon's husband.
Listen, if you don't find Porter there, you might wanna check some of the bars outside the front gate.
I'm on it, boss.
Everything's gonna be okay now, honey, okay?
Gibbs.
A word, please?
I just talked to her a few hours ago.
Gun safe.
I found it in the master bedroom.
Open and empty except for a handful of shells.
.40 calibre.
Thinking maybe the husband did this, yes?
I guess the polite term, Agent DiNozzo, would be "bastard."
He was always borrowing my husband's tools and never returning them.
I should've known this would happen.
Stealing tools isn't really a prerequisite for murder, Mrs. Goodwin.
All I'm saying is the two of them had one hell of a marriage.
You wouldn't know it to look at her, but Sun's got a set of lungs.
Or at least she did.
- So they fought a lot?
- Oh, hardly a night went by you didn't hear all sorts of screaming coming from this house.
- You ever think to make a complaint?
- l don't like to stick my nose in.
Good thing, too. lt could have been me that got slaughtered.
On our way, McGee.
Sergeant Porter was spotted 30 minutes ago at the "E" Club.
- McGee's almost there.
- Thanks.
Probie's not gonna make a move on his own, is he, boss?
McGee can take care of himself, DiNozzo.
You're on the hump.
- He's gone.
- Nice job, probie.
The bartender turned around, Sgt. Porter wasn't there anymore.
- You let him get past you?
- lt was before I got here, Tony.
What's Sergeant Porter driving?
- What kind of car does he drive?
- A black 2004 Ford F-1 50, boss.
Hey, come on.
Boss, we got a weapon in the front seat.
I think he's dead, boss.
NClS.
Don't move.
Get your hands on the wheel.
I wasn't gonna drive.
Come on, it's not dui if I don't have the key in the ignition, look.
- What's he talking about?
- l think he thinks we're busting him
- for driving drunk.
- Well, you're not?
No.
- lt's for double homicide.
- McGee.
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
I knew he was alive.
Precision, Mr. Palmer.
It's what separates the professional from the dilettante.
Thank you, doctor.
Now, careful.
Not too much pressure.
But not too little either.
All right, come on, come on, come on.
Let's see.
Yes, very good.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Keep a steady hand.
There's no room for error.
You never know which element of the enigma, however minuscule, can lead you to the solution.
Palmer just got some of your elements on his plastic thing.
- Occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
- What can you tell me, Duck?
Both women were shot three times in the chest.
It's hard to say which of these six was the fatal wound.
Suffice to say, neither woman died of old age.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
Mrs. Porter has some swelling and fissures on her fingers and knuckles.
- Defensive wounds.
- Possibly.
Yeah, but these didn't happen today.
There are also bruises on her wrists.
I'd say they were at least a week old.
She was abused?
Yeah.
- Thanks, Duck.
- You have the man in custody now?
Yeah.
There's no need to be gentle with him, Jethro.
You missed a spot.
We're looking at a Beretta Cougar 8040, Gibbs.
It was registered to Sergeant Porter in 2003
- and it's got his fingerprints all over it.
- Bullets?
Cross-point .40 calibre Smith and Wesson.
Also called a "Short and Wimpy," although I do not know why.
They lack the power of a 1 0-millimeter auto-load.
You don't need that stopping power when you gun down housewives.
- What about gunshot residue?
- Instant Shooter Kit came negative
- on Porter's skin, shirt and pants.
- Could've worn gloves--
Or he could've changed clothes.
I'm way ahead of you.
That's why I'm doing a full analysis on all of Porter's wardrobe.
"How long, Abby?" Well, it's gonna take some time.
And since this stuff doesn't smell very good I don't think laundry was a priority.
"Abs."
Two hours.
Whenever I know something, you'll know something.
"You got one.
Anything else?" Yes, as a matter of fact.
This is for you.
- Why?
- For getting me out of sensitivity training.
We were about to do trust falls and those guys in administration have wandering hands.
"Just give me their names, Abs, and I'll break them for you."
I know you will, Gibbs.
And that is why I love you.
Boss, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
What did I say about apologising, McGee?
Sign of weakness.
So is barfing on your tie.
This isn't mine.
We've got Sergeant Porter in interrogation.
I actually managed to dodge most of it.
Good news is that he is sober enough to talk now.
I got some on you, here, let me get this.
- Don't.
- Sorry.
I mean, it won't happen again.
- Who's watching him?
- Tony and Ziva.
I was actually just gonna go change my shirt.
No, you won't.
You're gonna follow up on other leads.
We found Sergeant Porter with the murder weapon.
What other leads?
A good investigator doesn't sit back and wait.
You run down every angle, every lead.
Assume everything you've been told is a lie until it checks out.
Got it.
There's only one time I want you to stop, McGee.
- When you tell me.
- When you're satisfied.
When you're satisfied.
Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
Get me another cup of coffee.
This is gonna be good.
Gibbs will rip this guy apart.
I don't know if that's the right tactic in this case, Tony.
What, are you an expert on suspect interviews, now?
Interviews, no.
lnterrogation techniques, yes.
Like hooking a car battery up to a guy's privates?
I'm sure it's effective, but judges tend to frown on it.
I've learned from Gibbs that in certain cases you can attract far more bees with honey.
Flies.
- What do flies have to do with honey?
- Flies don't like vinegar.
Vinegar?
It's complicated.
Here he comes.
Here you go.
There.
You look like you could use it.
My wife's really dead, sir?
How?
Drink your coffee, sergeant.
When you're ready we'll work our way up to it.
What's he doing?
Where's his strong-arming?
The intimidation?
The psychological bullying?
The Gibbs?
Bad marriage, huh?
It's okay.
I've had a few myself.
It wasn't perfect, but I loved her, sir.
Problem was... I don't think--
I don't think she ever loved me.
I'll bet she loved that paycheque, though, right?
Yeah.
I should have known it.
Just look at me.
She was way out of my league, you know?
She just married me to get to the States.
It happens.
Thing is... I guess I always thought she might change her mind, you know?
Then she started sneaking out to the "O" Club, hanging out with officers.
I've seen it before.
She thought she could trade up.
She didn't want me.
No matter what I did.
It just got to the point-- l just wanted her to disappear.
Yeah, when you get pushed, you want to push back.
That why you decide to blow her away?
Excuse me, sir?
is that the reason you shot Min Crane and your wife to death today?
Okay, here we go.
He hasn't confessed yet.
- He will.
- Maybe.
- How much do you wanna bet?
- How about nothing?
- Twenty bucks?
- Deal.
I'm telling you I didn't kill them, sir.
The murder weapon was in your truck, sergeant.
Someone must have put it there.
Your fingerprints are all over it.
I didn't shoot my wife, sir.
Did you use your fists on her, sergeant?
Knock her around a little bit, or maybe or maybe that just wasn't cutting it anymore.
I never laid a hand on Sun.
Your neighbour heard the fights, sergeant.
I saw the hole you punched.
I only punched the hole in the wall so I wouldn't hit her, sir.
Her hands were all bruised and cut from where she fought you off all the time.
- That's not how it happened.
- Really?
How did I get it wrong?
How'd it happen?
She was the--
She the one who was abusing me.
You don't believe me?
Take a look at this.
Sit down.
Sun was violent, sir.
She hit me.
She called me names.
She threw things.
I tried to hold her off but I never-- l never once laid a hand on her.
I just wanted it to stop.
- Pay up.
- He didn't confess.
- lt was damn close.
- Close doesn't cut it, DiNozzo.
Well, we got enough evidence even if you didn't break him in interrogation, boss.
Not to say that you couldn't have broken him if you wanted to.
I really like that shirt.
Tony's right. we have Sgt. Porter's gun with his fingerprints in his car.
He blows away his wife and her friend in a rage.
Gets drunk.
Passes out
- before he can commit suicide.
- Why did he police his brass?
- Habit of a well-trained Marine.
- He worked the motor pool.
According to his records, he failed to qualify twice on the pistol range last year.
Abby get the results of the GSR tests on his clothing yet?
- All negative, boss.
- He could have worn gloves
- or got rid of the clothes he's wearing.
- But he leaves his pistol in full view on the front seat.
Boss, I think I've got something here.
I just spoke with the director of the Officers' Club.
Apparently Sun Porter was a regular fixture there.
Almost always with Min Crane.
A month ago, they were all banned.
- For what, McGee?
- One of their husbands showed up, made a scene, had to be carried out.
Another nail in Sergeant Porter's coffin.
It wasn't Sergeant Porter, Tony.
Sergeant James Dawson.
Yoon's husband.
Heard you guys got Sergeant Porter at the "E" Club with the murder weapon.
I knew they were having troubles, but never expected this.
Where's your wife, Sergeant Dawson?
She's taking a nap with our daughter.
Why?
is something wrong, sir?
What happened at the Officer's Club last month?
Let me refresh your memory.
You had an altercation with two Marine captains.
Yeah, it was nothing.
It was just a misunderstanding.
Big enough for a Letter of Reprimand in your SRB.
Maybe we should ask your wife about it, sergeant?
- She had a rough day. I'd rather not--
- Down the hall?
Yeah, but I'd rather not disturb her.
- We'll see if she's still breathing.
- You think I killed Sun and Min because they had a couple of drinks with my wife at the "O" Club?
Mrs. Dawson, NClS.
We're gonna ask you a few questions.
Yoon. lt's me.
Please.
Yoon, open up.
- Do you have a key?
- lt's locked from the inside.
Yoon.
Yoon.
It's okay. lt's okay.
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Someone kills my wife's two best friends, then they decide to kidnap her?
When's the last time you saw her, sergeant?
About an hour before you showed up.
She was putting the baby to sleep in our room.
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.
Can we stop standing around and do something?
We are.
We are.
Sit down.
And what exactly is that, sir?
Figuring out if you're a suspect or a victim.
The window was broken from the outside.
Whoever did this slipped in, grabbed her and slipped out.
None of the neighbours heard or saw anything unusual, boss.
MP's are searching the area.
Also checking every vehicle leaving the base.
- You think she still might be on base?
- lt's possible.
We need to be out there looking for her.
If she's still on base we'll find her.
Someone put a lot of effort into taking her away without alerting you.
There's a good chance she's not dead yet.
Yet?
Oh, God, why would someone do this?
For the same reason someone killed her friends.
You think I had something to do with this?
Sit down.
What happened at the Officer's Club, sergeant?
It was nothing, okay?
Sun and Min go there all the time.
Yoon just drops them off.
This one time she went in and had a couple of drinks.
She couldn't drive home so she called me.
- Gibbs.
- Boss--
When did you get into a verbal altercation with the Marine captains?
They were drunk, okay?
They were hitting on my wife.
They tried to stop me from taking her home.
What would you do, sir?
You think one of these captains might have had something to do with this?
We're wasting our time. I'm telling you, I had nothing to do with this.
I know that.
Your alibi just checked out.
The sergeant was on duty at the time of the shootings.
So what now, sir?
Three Korean women met and married Marines in Seoul at roughly the same time.
Two of them are dead.
Our prime suspect was locked up here when the third went missing.
Think it's a racial thing?
No.
Definitely do not think that it's a hate crime.
In my experience there's only one colour in the Marines.
What I've seen of your Marine Corps, it's very ethnically diverse.
He means green, Ziva.
And I think he's right.
Well, maybe it's a Korean thing.
Maybe something in their past.
Like some kind of blood feud.
Competing villages, ancient oaths, revenge from across the ocean.
This is not one of your stupid action movies, Tony.
No, it isn't.
If it was, you'd be dressed differently.
And you'd be far better looking.
You'd be dead by the opening credits.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe I am the plucky comic relief?
You find out what the hell happened to Yoon Dawson yet?
Plucky?
- Well, Ziva and Tony and l--
- Were just working on that, boss.
We're going through a list of anyone who had access to the base in the last two days.
So far, no solid leads.
What about the Marines Sergeant Dawson fought with?
Both transferred out of Quantico last month.
One at Camp Pendleton, the other is in Okinawa.
The two dead women lived insular lives.
They spent most of their time together with other Koreans.
Yoon Dawson seems to be the only one who embraced American life.
Any reason to believe that Sergeant Porter isn't still involved in this?
He could have had an accomplice, probie.
He could have had three, DiNozzo.
We need more information.
Actually, boss, Abby and I, we have been working on something.
We got the women's phone records, credit card receipts, address books.
Abby is referencing to see if there's a pattern.
DiNozzo, I want to know about anybody in the area who's made threats against Koreans, foreign Marine wives, or women.
Oh, is that all?
- On it, boss.
- Find out about their lives before they married Marines.
Come on, you're with me, Elf Lord.
It's amazing how much you can find out about someone without actually meeting them.
For instance, me and these women have absolutely nothing in common.
They web-browse for cake recipes, gardening tips and Min Crane has some weird obsession with stained glass.
That's not even mentioning their music downloads.
One word:
Yanni.
Good point.
Who cares?
Their schedules were pretty regulated.
On Wednesdays and Fridays they trekked to Koreatown.
They'd shop for a couple of hours, then they'd have tea at Lee's Neighbourhood Market.
They alternated paying.
It was Sun Porter's turn, by the way.
Not exactly groundbreaking police work there.
- She's not done yet, McGee.
- Thank you, Gibbs.
Within the last month, all three of them received regular phone calls from a pay phone located just outside Lee's Neighbourhood Market.
It is owned and operated by Lee Sung.
He sells Korean delicacies, fruits and vegetables and those cute little anime figurines with the funny faces.
Oh, I love those.
He also has a catering business, Lee's Delights.
It's authentic Korean food.
Very high end.
All three women have worked for him as hostesses and they were scheduled to work an event for him tomorrow afternoon.
- How do you know?
- Because.
Lee's Sung e-mailed them the instructions.
It's a Korean diplomatic event at the Pacific Rim Society.
Tell me I didn't just smack McGee for no good reason.
You didn't smack McGee for no good reason.
Last night, Yoon Dawson used her cell phone to call the pay phone outside Lee's Market.
Two hours later...she's missing.
Why is this important?
Because someone is still using her cell phone to call that pay phone.
- Can we get a fix on the phone?
- Negatory, McGee.
I know it's somewhere in Annandale, Virginia, but they turn it off before I can get an exact location.
The last phone call was an hour ago.
McGee, I want a tap on that damn pay phone.
Abby, I wanna know who answers it.
That's good work, Abs.
What was that for?
For mocking my groundbreaking police work.
I was not mocking you--
Won't happen again.
Damn, I can't believe this.
I don't really like waiting here either, Tony.
No, Nick and Jessica broke up.
I'm always the last to know.
Hey, DiNozzo.
- Shut up.
- Shutting up, boss.
Hey, probie, you getting this?
Yeah, got it, Tony.
It's Yoon Dawson's cell phone again.
I want a location, McGee.
Whoever it is, they disabled the onboard GPS chip.
We'll have to do this the old-fashioned way.
Just take a moment to get a bead on the cell phone grid it's interfacing with.
We got someone headed to the phone, boss.
- You want us to take him down now?
- Negative.
Wait until we trace the call.
Okay, I've got the cell phone grid located.
It's coming from this neighbourhood.
Somewhere on this street.
You copy that, DiNozzo?
Well, we're scanning for targets now.
There are a lot of possibles.
If you don't respond, I'm gonna hang up.
Don't, I have information for you.
Wool cap, head down, heading towards the pay phone.
Got him.
Drop your weapon.
Federal agents, move!
It's Yoon Dawson, boss.
She's rabitting.
We're cutting her off, DiNozzo.
I know she didn't pass us.
Well, where the hell did she go?
It's like she disappeared.
She didn't disappear.
It's her hat.
She climbed her way out.
If I am here, I answer the pay phone, Agent McGee.
Many people in this community are poor.
Can't afford phone service, so I take messages for them.
You see, it helps them and it is good for my business when they come to pick up.
Boss, did you find her?
Yeah, McGee.
She's hiding in my coffee cup.
We didn't find her.
Just give us one second, please.
Has he calmed down yet?
Well, he's a little shaky but I think he's ready to talk.
Min and Sun.
They are dead?
It's my fault.
I take responsibility.
I try to help people new to this country.
Find jobs for them, get them training, classes.
Sometimes even loan money.
You hired all three of them to work for your catering company?
I did.
I would notice when Yoon was tired, her accent would change.
Sometimes she would use words not common in my country since the war.
Yoon-Sook Dawson wasn't South Korean.
I began to believe that she was from the North.
Perhaps a spy?
Why didn't you go to the police?
Well, I couldn't be sure.
What if I was wrong?
I asked Min and Sun to find out where she grew up, what schools she go to.
Then I check her answers and try to locate relatives from Korea.
- Nothing.
- Who else knew
- you were checking up on her?
- Min Crane, Sun Porter and myself.
She was trying to protect her cover?
She failed.
We're taking you into protective custody, Mr. Sung.
No.
I will not hide.
- Mr. Sung, she could come back.
- Let her.
I am ready this time.
I won't stop living my life because of people like her.
- Sir, I really don't think that this--
- Mr. Sung.
Thank you for your help.
If you think of anything else, give me a call.
Yes, I will.
And please thank your agents for me.
Boss, you're not really gonna let him just--
McGee, you know the fbi does not exist only to piss me off.
Sometimes they can actually be useful.
Hey, Fornell.
I got one right up your jurisdiction.
Like my father always said, "Be careful who you marry, Anthony.
She may end up being a homicidal maniac."
- Your father actually said that to you?
- No, but I'm sure he thought it.
Probably he knew your taste in women.
Abby's got active taps on Sergeant Dawson's cell, home and work phones, boss.
- lf she calls her husband, we'll know.
- She won't.
The fbi team shadowing Mr. Sung is tied directly into MTAC.
They're last report had him loading up a catering truck for a job.
No sign of Yoon Dawson yet.
It's highly doubtful she'd make another attempt on his life.
We've got four agents providing surveillance on Dawson's house.
She definitely won't be returning home.
And how do you know this, Officer David?
Because Yoon Dawson wouldn't.
Now tell us what you'd do.
If I was Yoon, everything I've done up to this point was to protect my cover.
I've dealt with the two possible threats on base and-- lf by "dealt" you mean gunning down two defenceless housewives... I attempted to deal with the third, but my cover was blown.
I'm now only left with a few possibilities.
You rush back to your country?
Or carry out whatever mission I was assigned before I'm captured or killed.
She's been in the States for three years.
If you had a mission, wouldn't you have carried it out?
Not if I'm a sleeper, McGee.
She could be here for decades before being activated.
So tell us, Jane Bond, how do we track you down, huh?
You don't, Tony.
By now I've changed my appearance, I've replaced my identity with backup documents and I've relocated.
Promise?
Okay, so that about wraps it up.
Who's up for lunch?
You might think about this, I'm gonna pay.
No one's eating until we find Yoon Dawson.
It's not that Tony couldn't stand to lose a little weight but we'd all starve to death before that happened.
She's playing it like I would.
She's gone.
There's one difference between the two of you, Ziva.
You don't have a baby girl.
Most likely part of her cover or an occupational accident.
- lt's more than that.
- How can you tell?
My gut.
Come on.
You're with me.
Let's go.
Hey, probie.
Let me ask you a question.
You don't think she was serious about the whole losing a few pounds thing?
Are you gonna hit me if I tell you the truth?
No, man.
We're buds.
Yeah.
My wife is not a spy, sir.
Her South Korean passport's a forgery.
It's not possible, okay?
Yoon loves this country.
She knows more about it than me.
She was trained to, it's called a honey trap.
Her assignment was to meet an eligible serviceman, seduce him and gain access into this country.
Oh, yeah?
Then why was she trying to convince me to leave the Marine Corps and go to college?
Most likely you were not part of the assignment.
- You were a means to an end.
- Listen.
Okay, I've lived with her for five years.
She's the mother of my child.
I'm telling you, there's no way.
- What's this?
- Your wife.
No, that can't be real.
It's real.
Min Crane and Sun Porter?
She killed them?
- Oh, my God.
- Has she tried to contact you?
- No.
- She's a foreign agent, Marine.
You lie about this, it's treason.
She hasn't.
She hasn't tried to contact me, sir.
Okay, we think she might.
If she does and you confront her, she will most likely kill you.
I just can't believe this.
Go ahead.
- Hello?
- lt's me, James.
Yoon, what the hell is going on?
NClS is here.
- They're telling me all sorts of things.
- Don't speak.
Just listen to me, okay?
You need to come home now.
It's too late for that.
I've done things.
- Terrible things.
- l don't care, all right?
Tell me where you are and I'll come and get you.
There's one more thing that I need to do.
I don't have a choice.
- l never had a choice.
- Just tell me why.
- Please, sweetheart.
- No matter what they say, what they tell you about me, know that I loved you with all my heart.
That it was for real.
And tell Rebecca--
Tell her Mommy is sorry for this.
All of it.
This is insane.
Yoon, you can't do-- l love you both so much, more than you can imagine but I can't let it happen.
Yoon, don't.
Yoon, don't hang up.
I got her, Tony.
She's at a pay phone in Annandale, Virginia.
The corner of Raven Road and Lancaster Drive.
- Way to go, Abs.
- Kind of a weird place to be hiding out.
There's nothing there except country clubs.
Lee Sung's catering job?
The Pacific Rim Society.
It's in Annandale!
Either that's a coincidence or she really, really wants to kill this guy.
- l don't believe in coincidence.
- "l don't believe in coincidence."
No.
No, Yoon.
Where is it, Lee Sung?
Have you no honour left, woman?
More than you.
Scream and I kill you.
Found out why the fbi isn't responding, boss.
- She's definitely here.
- Keep looking, DiNozzo.
I'm right behind you.
I will kill you if you don't answer this time.
Where?
In the truck.
Drop the weapon.
There's a bomb set to go off in this building.
If you kill me now, we all die.
Put your weapon down.
I was a North Korean operative.
We kind of figured that part out on our own.
The part that you don't know is that my cell included Sun Porter,
- Min Crane and this man.
- She's lying.
I swear on the life of my daughter that I'm trying to prevent this attack.
And I swear if you don't release your weapon, I will kill you.
The bomb is in his truck.
Please, we may only have minutes left.
- Now do you believe me?
- Can you disarm it?
If I had a couple of days, maybe.
You?
I could try.
But I suggest not standing within five miles of here while I attempt it.
- l can.
- She put it there.
She's trying to kill us all.
They're evacuating the building, boss.
And the--
- That's a really big bomb.
- You think, DiNozzo?
I didn't kill them to maintain my cover, Agent Gibbs.
I did it to keep my family.
- l failed.
- She's a North Korean spy.
Not anymore.
At least let me prevent this.
McGee, get Sung out of here.
- Get the cuffs off her.
- Gibbs.
It's not a debate, Officer David.
Go.
Go on.
Get out of here.
All of you.
Get a clear distance away.
I'll handle it from here.
I don't care how hard you whack me, boss.
- l'm not going anywhere.
- Nor am I.
If we survive this, you're both fired.
It's supposed to do that, right?
It's done.
The bomb is no longer armed.
So what happens now, sir?
The fbi will take her into custody, sergeant.
And then prison?
Your wife is an agent of a hostile power.
It all depends what kind of a deal she can make.
She was also responsible for bringing down an entire North Korean cell and saving hundreds of lives, sergeant.
I'm sure that will be taken into consideration.
Right, Officer David?
Yes, of course.
Her knowledge of the inner workings of North Korean intelligence should proved to be invaluable.
Guys, give her a minute.
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to do the right thing.
Everything you said to me on the phone, I believe in you.
I'll always believe it, no matter what happens.
Come here.
It's okay.
- l'm so sorry.
- l know.
Let's go.
Tony,
Ziva, what happened back there with the bomb,
- l want you both to know--
- You don't have to say it, boss.
We know how you feel about us.
Gibbs, we're a team.
That's what we do.
I was going to say, if either one of you two wing nuts ever disobey a direct order again, I'll kill you myself.
That's our boss.
There is something missing from our world.
The amazing animals that time has left behind.
But what if we could bring them back?
What if extinction didn't have to be for ever?
We're going back in time on a safari with a difference as wildlife adventurer Nigel Marven plunges into prehistory to rescue creatures on the brink of extinction.
His plan is to bring them back to the safety of the present and give them a second chance.
On his very first mission, he hopes to rescue one of the last of the dinosaurs from the most dramatic extinction ever.
Welcome to the ultimate wildlife sanctuary.
Welcome to Prehistoric Park.
It's a big day at Prehistoric Park.
Throughout this huge reserve, everyone is busy preparing for the first arrivals.
Come on, lads!
Quick as you like!
Can you get a 10-foot pole down to the bottom of the paddock.
They've almost finished the enclosures for everyhing from giant insects to dinosaurs.
Check everything!
This is home to a dangerous creature!
If Nigel can make extinct animals feel at home anywhere, it's here.
(Nigel) The natural geography will help us contain the animals.
There's the ocean to the south and, to the north, a mountain range.
Everything I need in terms of habitats - savannah, forest, rivers.
There's even a waterfall.
Perfect environments for prehistoric animals.
All they need now are the prehistoric creatures themselves.
One day Nigel plans to breed extinct animals in captivity.
But his first step is to only bring a few of each species back to see how they get on in the 21st century.
And Nigel knows exactly what he wants to start with.
The meanest and scariest of them all -
Tyrannosaurus Rex!
(Roar)
He's already worked out when and where he'll have to go to track one down.
The most widely accepted theory about why dinosaurs became extinct is a meteorite smashed into the Earth.
This is the Earth 65 million years ago.
This is where the impact was, somewhere in Mexico.
You can still see the crater.
Around that time there were masses of T-Rex here, somewhere in Montana.
I need to go back there to find them.
To rescue the last of the T-Rex,
Nigel is going back to the very end of the age of dinosaurs, as close to the meteorite impact as he dares.
65 million years ago Montana looks very different.
This is a world before grass, where volcanoes dominate the landscape.
Here, T-Rex is king.
Now all Nigel needs to do is to find one.
In a place with so many potential dangers,
Nigel and his team know the sooner they accomplish their mission, the better.
I just hope I haven't bitten off more than I can chew.
We've got so little time.
There's some wonderful forest over there.
Perfect habitat.
I think that's where we'll begin our search for T-Rex.
T
- Rex is a monster.
At a staggering 45 feet long and five tons, it shouldn't be too hard to track one down.
(Distant animal cries)
What he'll do when he does find one is not exactly clear.
(Animal screeches)
T
- Rex are not the only creatures around.
This must be a track way.
Look... you can see here these leaves have been nibbled, these twigs have been snapped off.
There's been a vegetarian browsing here and...
Ah!
The first evidence of dinosaurs.
Hard to see, but you can see this footprint here.
Three toes.
This is the classic theropod dinosaur, the same family as T-Rex.
They stand on two legs, they're bipedal.
It looks like there's a whole group.
Not as big as T-Rex, and vegetarian, as you can tell by the leaves.
And they've gone this way.
This is a big track way.
There must be a few of them.
And they've gone down this way.
His hunch is right.
An animal is rustling.
(Rustling)
This is what normally happens with reptiles.
You hear them before you see them, hear them scurrying through the bushes.
(Whispers) It's still moving around there.
This could be our first dinosaurs.
(Animal screeches)
Can you see that?
Ornithomimus.
I've seen the fossils in museums.
Ornithomimus means "bird mimic".
You can see why.
Exactly like an ostrich.
(Whispers) See how close we can get.
(Screech)
That went right through me!
That was a warning.
And look...
All the others are all looking up.
He must have been the sentry.
The others are looking at us now, heads popping up all over the place.
(Screech)
And they're vegetarians.
But they won't turn their beaks up at the odd insect or bit of meat.
And completely the opposite of what you'd imagine a dinosaur to be like.
These beaks at the front have ridges inside, just like modern ducks and geese, and they use those to crush their food.
This is terrific.
Our first dinosaurs.
(Screech)
These Ornithomimus will soon be extinct, too, unless, of course, Nigel can save one.
I'd love a breeding herd of Ornithomimus, but we need a technique for catching them.
And I think this will work.
I've done it with ostriches.
You slip a sock over their head.
As soon as you cover their eyes, they calm down.
The only trouble I've got is that these things can run at 40 miles per hour.
There's so many in this herd, if I can get in their midst there will be a commotion and hopefully I can grab hold of one of them.
(Shrieks)
(Squawks)
(Growls)
But now there's something else to contend with, something much, much bigger.
Something's chasing them.
It looks like the T-Rex have found Nigel before Nigel could find them.
(Roar)
No sudden moves.
(Roar)
Nigel does have one advantage.
T
- Rex is so top heavy, that if they trip, the fall can kill them.
(Roar)
A bite of Nigel isn't worth the risk.
Down, mate!
Get down!
(Roar)
That was a close one.
Predators don't like confined spaces like this.
And that's why the T-Rex are staying back there, I'm sure.
I think what we've got to do now is go back to camp.
Day One over and there's no T-Rex to take home.
At least there's no sign of the meteorite, either, but it can't be far away.
The following morning, the camp has some visitors.
(Animals growl)
More creatures in the last throes of their existence.
A glorious sight to wake up to.
A big herd of Triceratops.
This is a tremendous sight.
When the fossils were found, they named these Triceratops Horridus.
It means "horrid three-horned face", but how could they?
They are gorgeous.
And big, too!
Eight tons.
And one over there, it's a big male, is at least 25 feet, eight metres long.
The good thing for us is there are a lot of them.
They're prey animals for T-Rex.
I've seen tracks of the predator over there.
Prey and predator attracted to waterholes.
I'm going to follow the tracks and see if we can find a T-Rex lair.
The footprints are fresh and it looks like a well-used track.
T
- Rex are fast movers, reaching 40 miles an hour when they need to.
Nigel's hoping these ones aren't too far away.
The tracks are really beginning to tell a story.
Look here.
A depression in the ash.
That was a big tail sweep.
There was a kerfuffle here.
Another tail drag over there.
The tracks are going on.
We're getting towards the centre of the territory.
What Nigel doesn't realise is he's already in the centre of their territory!
(Roar)
(Shriek)
Crouch down!
Get over here.
Get down.
This is their home.
There's bones scattered all over.
They obviously bring food back here.
It's terrific.
That kerfuffle back there, that must have been the juveniles fighting over scraps of food.
It's dangerous play.
T
- Rex have huge jaw muscles, giving them a bite 10 times more powerful than a lion's.
And there's males and females here.
In the fossil record, T-Rex skeletons have been found together.
That's a clue that they associate.
(Roar)
They're a real mob, like a gang looking for trouble.
They really interact.
I wonder if they hunt in packs.
(Roar)
Suddenly they all started moving this way.
It's one thing to find a T-Rex, but it's another thing to take one home.
Fortunately, dinosaurs lay eggs and they're a lot easier to carry.
I can go and have a look now, see if we can find any eggs or a nesting site.
Amongst the remains of the T-Rex victims littered across the den,
Nigel finds what he's looking for.
Unfortunately, he's too late.
This is all I can find, empty T-Rex eggshells.
They've been broken into by a predator, or more likely, they're last season's eggs.
It's so disappointing.
If we could have found a fresh nest and got the eggs, that would have been the easiest option.
Another day and he's still no closer to saving a T-Rex.
And up above are the first signs that the meteorite is closing in.
Streaking across tonight's sky are shooting stars.
Huge boulders plough into the Earth's atmosphere at 20, 000 miles an hour.
They are the precursor of something much, much bigger.
Look at this cosmological activity.
Those are meteors.
They burn up in the atmosphere, but they're in the bow wake of the meteorite.
And the meteorite, when that comes, will smack into the Earth.
That's the problem.
And we really have got such little time here.
I'm hoping tomorrow goes better and we can save a T-Rex or two.
The next day, the pack of T-Rex turn up, looking for trouble.
They're after their favourite food - Triceratops.
(Roar)
They're charging for the Triceratops, right in the midst of the herd there.
What the T-Rex will do is find the weakest.
A fully-grown Triceratops is far from defenceless.
Their frill is made of solid bone.
But the younger Triceratops know better than to stand their ground.
Aagh.
I feel like I've been hit by a train!
A baby Triceratops has run the wrong way.
The more it struggles, the more trouble it's in as the T-Rex's 13-inch serrated teeth sink deeper and deeper.
But help is at hand.
There's a Triceratops here fighting back the big female T-Rex.
(Roar)
The horn's gone right into the upper thigh.
(Screech)
And the males have just left her.
They've just skedaddled.
So much for the pack!
Now the injured female has to make her own kill.
It looks like she's spotted her next victim - another youngster.
(Roar)
For Nigel, it's the chance he's been waiting for.
He sets up the time portal.
Maybe I can get two dinosaur species for the price of one.
If I can lure the Triceratops through the time portal and then maybe the T-Rex will follow.
Aagh!
Come on!
Come on, T-Rex.
(Roar)
That's certainly not a T-Rex!
But, weighing in at three tons, this young male Triceratops is a great start.
It's not long before news spreads that Prehistoric Park's first dinosaur has arrived.
The park's vet, Suzanne, heads over to take a look for herself.
It's a Triceratops!
It's a Triceratops!
He's done it!
Our first dinosaur, and look at him.
He's magnificent.
Park-keeper Bob is keen to move the newcomer into a secure enclosure.
Whoa!
That's far enough.
Although he was an unexpected arrival,
Nigel thinks they've got the perfect place to put him.
Come on, I need to have a look at that.
Up you go.
Triceratops - our first dinosaur.
We need a good place to keep him.
I want to call him Theo.
It's a great name.
But he needs vegetation to browse on.
Over here there's too much grass.
So Bob's found the perfect spot, down here by the river.
That's where his enclosure will be.
They're just about to unload him.
- How are you, Nigel?
- Thrilled to bits.
Our first dinosaur.
It's short notice, but I forgive you as our new visitor is magnificent, to say the least.
- How's the enclosure?
- A bit makeshift, but it will do for now.
I've given him a name as well.
- Theo the triceratops.
- Theo.
Good name.
(Yells) All right!
Let him out!
Here he comes.
Whoa, whoa!
- (Laughs) Hey!
- Look at that!
Plenty for him to eat.
Well done, Bob.
It's great.
All right, lads.
Come on.
Get the boards away and the truck out of there.
(Nigel) Really pleased with this habitat.
Grass is no good for dinosaurs.
It hadn't evolved when they were around.
Triceratops is not like a cow.
It doesn't graze.
It browses like a black rhinoceros.
It needs low shrubs and trees.
There's plenty of those for Theo here.
And its beak can snap off branches as thick as my arm.
This is gonna be great for him to thrive.
For Theo to grow to eight tons, he'll have to spend most of his life eating.
With the park's first dinosaur settled,
Nigel turns his attention once again to T-Rex.
And the pressure's back on Bob to finish off the enclosure.
I didn't have a clue how to build a compound for a T-Rex.
I've only seen one in a story book, but Nigel thinks this will do.
There's lots of area to run around, lots of shade to get out of the sun.
And if it wants to, it can stand up on the hill and survey its domain.
The enclosure will have to be finished soon because Nigel's on his way back to where he left off... 65 million years ago.
And this time he's promised to return with a T-Rex.
It's not just the dinosaurs that will be wiped out by the meteorite hit.
Nigel knows that everyhing he sees around him will be devastated.
(Animals squawk)
What a magnificent place!
Pterosaurs swooping overhead.
You can hear them calling all the time.
And sweet water.
It's hard to believe that this stream will be choked with ash and dust.
The meteorite will hit not too far away.
Time is running out.
This is my second rescue mission.
I am determined to save some T-Rex for Prehistoric Park.
There are lots of dinosaur tracks to follow, but Nigel is interested in one set in particular.
There's something strange with these tracks.
Look.
The toes have been dragged along.
I think it's the female T-Rex that was gored in the stampede.
We're close to where the Triceratops stampede was.
She's dragged her toes.
She's injured and she'll be moving pretty slowly.
If we head downstream and follow these tracks, we may catch her up.
The track takes him down river, where he's hoping to gain ground on the T-Rex.
With any luck, her leg injury will make her slower and a little easier to catch.
Listen.
Her footfalls are reverberating around the valley.
She's up there somewhere.
And an animal that weighs six tons can't walk quietly.
There, that's what she's after.
There's a Triceratops corpse and she can smell that.
That's why she's been moving along the river.
(Pounding footfalls)
(Whispers) Come on!
Get on the bank.
She's there.
I don't want her to see us.
(Roars)
(High-pitched cry)
She's starting to move away.
I'm certain it's the female that was attacked by the Triceratops.
She's been able to track down this free meal despite being on her own and badly injured because T-Rex's have a superb sense of smell.
(Roars)
She's in luck.
The triceratops carcass has become stuck.
This is Nigel's chance to get really close to her.
She must be so hungry.
She's desperate for an easy meal.
Even though T-Rex is everyone's ultimate monster, you feel sorry for her.
She's a top predator.
They're so top-heavy.
If she went in this fast-flowing water, she'd be flipped over.
But she's desperate for the meat.
You just feel so sorry for her.
She's desperate to get out there, but she's got no chance.
The T-Rex limps off, leaving Nigel to figure out what to do next.
(Bob) Keep the camera on him.
Back at Prehistoric Park,
Theo the Triceratops is displaying some unusual behaviour.
Bob has asked vet Suzanne to come and take a look.
- What is he doing?
- He's done it all morning.
- What do you think it is?
- Haven't a clue.
He just keeps charging at that tree!
Gosh!
Oh, my goodness, look!
What?
Oh, my goodness!
- The poor thing!
- Any ideas?
His frill has changed colour!
It wasn't like that before.
(Growls)
Maybe he's having a testosterone surge and he thinks that's a mate and he's charging him.
- You think he needs a playmate?
- I think he thinks that tree's a friend!
- (Laughs)
- What?
I've just had a very good idea.
- What?
Tell me.
- Wait and see.
Oh.
OK.
Thanks, fella.
Just round the side.
Bob has a plan.
He's convinced he can tame even Theo's teenage tantrums.
Meanwhile, Nigel has, at last, come up with a plan of his own.
We're trying a technique used by game capture teams for things like antelope.
The T-Rex is working her way down river.
We've got ahead of her.
She won't go onto uneven ground and she won't go near the water.
We've built this palisade of logs and we'll funnel her towards the time portal and back to the safety of the 21st century.
We hope.
Hi, Adam.
Give us a hand.
The meteorite is getting ever closer.
So is the T-Rex.
And a herd of Ornithomimus are running scared.
(Ornithomimus shriek)
There she is, the T-Rex.
That's why they're spooked.
(Roars)
(Ornithomimus shriek)
If we're lucky, she'll chase them through the time portal and we can have a breeding colony of Ornithomimus at Prehistoric Park.
Trapped between the T-Rex and the 21st century, they opt for the portal.
Yeah, one, two.
They are belting through!
A whole phalanx of them!
Bob is gonna get a real surprise.
Oh, my giddy aunt!
Nigel, Nigel, what have you done?
Suzanne, we've got a bit of a situation here!
(Shrieks)
But one Ornithomimus is slower than the rest.
Aagh!
(Ornithomimus shrieks)
(Crunch)
That was close.
She took the Ornithomimus right there.
It's just a snack for her.
It was a juvenile.
Time's running out.
We must follow her.
With its catch still uneaten, the hungry T-Rex limps off back the way she came.
I can't understand.
Why doesn't she just devour the Ornithomimus?
We cannot afford to lose her.
I do not want to go back to Prehistoric Park empty-handed.
(Animals Squawk)
Back at Prehistoric Park,
Bob is settling in the herd of highly-strung Ornithomimus.
They're still a bit stressed out from the capture.
They're walking round and round the perimeter fence.
They're checking out their new home, but they'll be all right.
I'm not gonna feed them till tomorrow, just let them settle in a bit.
With thatjob done, Bob's back to his workshop where his plan for the bad-tempered Triceratops is now in full swing.
- (Man) Tie her up.
- We want that one up there.
Up you go.
You're doing a grand job, but I need this finished this afternoon.
Nigel's still tracking the T-Rex.
She's almost on her last legs.
Moving so slowly now, Nigel's had a chance to catch up.
But where she's going remains a mystery.
Nigel is about to find out.
(Nigel) It's been a long climb, but worth it.
There's babies there.
She's badly injured, but the babies need food, so she's brought the Ornithomimus all the way here.
Palaeontologists suspected that dinosaurs showed parental care.
For us, it's fantastic.
We can get a whole family of T-Rex back to Prehistoric Park.
But Nigel's optimism is short-lived.
(Roars)
(Roars)
The male really wants that carcass.
And the young are hiding.
If he sees them, they could be in trouble.
I'm sure, like all reptiles, T
- Rex can be cannibalistic.
(Roars)
(Roars)
(Roars)
(Pounding footfalls)
I think she's fully stunned.
The babies, there's no chance for her.
Mum's fallen.
I can't see any movement at all here.
(Roars)
Hundreds of miles away, the meteorite has finally entered the Earth's atmosphere at 20, 000 miles an hour.
(Rumbling)
The sonic boom it creates is one of the loudest noises the world has ever known.
(Thunderous boom)
As it strikes the Gulf of Mexico, it causes an explosion seven billion times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.
It releases a blast front moving at a hundred times the speed of sound.
This devastation is just the start.
(Thunderous rumbling)
The cloud of ash will soar into the sky and molten rock will start raining down, igniting global wildfires.
And as it mushrooms out, it will engulf the entire world in a blanket of darkness.
All this is just three minutes away.
Nigel will have to think fast.
Has anyone got any food, anything that smells?
We need the odour to entice the T-Rex babies through the time portal.
I just hope we can make it.
This must work.
We've only got seconds left.
They should be curious about the meaty smell of the sandwich.
They're more likely to lunge at me and attack me.
Come on.
You've got to come.
We've got to get you back.
That's it, come on.
Yes!
(Thunderous explosions)
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
There are only two!
Our first T-Rex!
Nigel has finally managed to rescue T-Rex from extinction.
The two T-Rex babies are now safely in the observation pen.
Suzanne is making sure they're in good health before they're taken to their permanent enclosure.
They look undernourished, but Bob will sort that out.
They're eating really well.
They're only little, but they're still so powerful, aren't they?
They're cool, aren't they?
(Roars)
Prehistoric Park is now home to its first ever dinosaurs.
But vet Suzanne is concerned that one of them doesn't seem happy about being here.
He really doesn't look very happy.
Not when he stares like that.
He doesn't like me.
Back, Suzanne, he's charging!
You are trying to shake us up.
Theo has got such attitude now!
He's taken such a dislike to you.
He doesn't like you.
I hand-reared a fox before and when it got mature - it was a male as well - it started biting and attacking me.
He's mature and his hormones are fizzing through his body.
Too much testosterone.
Males always have to win!
(Engine whirs)
- (Suzanne) My goodness!
- Bob, what have you done now?
At last, Bob's plan is unveiled.
Look at this contraption!
Wa-hey, stop!
Suzanne, get the gates!
This is man's work!
Guys!
On we go!
Watch out, Theo, we're coming!
Good luck, boys.
You'll need it.
- Come on, Theo!
- Come on!
Where are you?
Oh!
He charged from over there.
He charged from the bamboo!
Bob's contraption is not as daft as it seems.
The tyre-padded tractor is a worthy opponent for Theo, giving him something to take his aggression out on.
It's a tactic gamekeepers use on rhinos.
OK, Bob!
And it looks like it's working giving all the boys a chance to let off steam.
Men!
- Look at him staring us out!
- We're getting at him!
That's why he's got breeding colours.
It's his first breeding season.
- He'd take on anything!
- He's taking on us!
Yee-haw!
Charge!
(Grunts)
That was great fun, exhausting work.
Never thought I'd joust with a Triceratops!
But that's what they did in the wild.
Look at this.
You can see injuries on the frill and neck.
They had jousting tournaments in nature.
It's keeping our boy occupied!
But he's got to win every time.
We can't get too excited with him.
I don't want him to get injured cos he's magnificent!
Nigel's dream ofhaving a park full ofprehistoric creatures he's saved from extinction is beginning to take shape.
The Ornithomimus are getting used to their new home.
The Triceratops has calmed down.
And the T-Rex babies have been put into their new enclosure.
- Fantastic.
Well done, Bob.
- It wasn't just me, it was the lads.
It's overkill now, when they're tiny, but when they're big, it's a perfect enclosure.
- Have you seen them at all?
- Not since I put them in there.
There's places for them to hide.
They're not gonna be stressed.
Look, there!
- Give them some names.
- I've done that.
- OK, what?
- Matilda for the big female.
Then Terence, he's a bit puny, for the younger male.
(Bob) Very nice, Nigel.
It's kinda cute really, I guess.
- They're not going to stay cute for long.
- No.
Nigel's right.
The T-Rex will double their body weight every year until full size, turning Terence and Matilda into the most ferocious killing machines for 65 million years.
Let's hope Prehistoric Park knows what it's letting itself in for.
(Roars)
Next time, Nigel sets his sights on a mammoth from the Ice Age.
But he's going to have to overcome the cold climate and a hostile reception.
(Roars)
Get these vet samples!
Managing the prehistoric creatures will not be as easy as they first thought.
Close the gate!
There is something missing from our world.
The amazing animals that time has left behind.
But what if we could bring them back?
What if extinction didn't have to be for ever?
We're going back in time on a safari with a difference as wildlife adventurer Nigel Marven plunges into prehistory to rescue creatures on the brink of extinction.
His plan is to bring them back to the safety of the present and give them a second chance.
On his very first mission, he hopes to rescue one of the last of the dinosaurs from the most dramatic extinction ever.
Welcome to the ultimate wildlife sanctuary.
Welcome to Prehistoric Park.
It's a big day at Prehistoric Park.
Throughout this huge reserve, everyone is busy preparing for the first arrivals.
Come on, lads!
Quick as you like!
Can you get a 1 0-foot pole down to the bottom of the paddock.
They've almost finished the enclosures for everything from giant insects to dinosaurs.
Check everything!
This is home to a dangerous creature!
If Nigel can make extinct animals feel at home anywhere, it's here.
(Nigel) The natural geography Will help us contain the animals.
There's the ocean to the south and, to the north, a mountain range.
Everything I need in terms of habitats - savannah, forest, rivers.
There's even a Waterfall.
Perfect environments for prehistoric animals.
All they need now are the prehistoric creatures themselves.
One day Nigel plans to breed extinct animals in captivity.
But his first step is to only bring a few of each species back to see how they get on in the 2 1st century.
And Nigel knows exactly what he wants to start with.
The meanest and scariest of them all -
Tyrannosaurus Rex!
(Roar)
He's already worked out when and where he'll have to go to track one down.
The most Widely accepted theory about Why dinosaurs became extinct is a meteorite smashed into the Earth.
This is the Earth 65 million years ago.
This is Where the impact Was, somewhere in Mexico.
You can still see the crater.
Around that time there Were masses of T-Rex here, somewhere in Montana.
I need to go back there to find them.
To rescue the last of the T-Rex,
Nigel is going back to the very end of the age of dinosaurs, as close to the meteorite impact as he dares.
65 million years ago Montana looks very different.
This is a world before grass, where volcanoes dominate the landscape.
Here, T-Rex is king.
Now all Nigel needs to do is to find one.
In a place with so many potential dangers,
Nigel and his team know the sooner they accomplish their mission, the better.
I just hope I haven't bitten off more than I can chew.
We've got so little time.
There's some Wonderful forest over there.
Perfect habitat. I think that's Where We'll begin our search for T-Rex.
T-Rex is a monster.
At a staggering 45 feet long and five tons, it shouldn't be too hard to track one down.
(Distant animal cries)
What he'll do when he does find one is not exactly clear.
(Animal screeches)
T-Rex are not the only creatures around.
This must be a track Way.
Look...you can see here these leaves have been nibbled, these twigs have been snapped off.
There's been a vegetarian browsing here and...
Ah!
The first evidence of dinosaurs.
Hard to see, but you can see this footprint here.
Three toes.
This is the classic theropod dinosaur, the same family as T-Rex.
They stand on two legs, they're bipedal.
It looks like there's a Whole group.
Not as big as T-Rex, and vegetarian, as you can tell by the leaves.
And they've gone this Way.
This is a big track Way.
There must be a few of them.
And they've gone down this Way.
His hunch is right.
An animal is rustling.
(Rustling)
This is What normally happens With reptiles.
You hear them before you see them, hear them scurrying through the bushes.
(Whispers) lt's still moving around there.
This could be our first dinosaurs.
(Animal screeches)
Can you see that?
Ornithomimus.
I've seen the fossils in museums.
Ornithomimus means "bird mimic".
You can see Why.
Exactly like an ostrich.
(Whispers) See how close We can get.
(Screech)
That Went right through me!
That Was a Warning.
And look...
All the others are all looking up.
He must have been the sentry.
The others are looking at us now, heads popping up all over the place.
(Screech)
And they're vegetarians.
But they Won't turn their beaks up at the odd insect or bit of meat.
And completely the opposite of What you'd imagine a dinosaur to be like.
These beaks at the front have ridges inside, just like modern ducks and geese, and they use those to crush their food.
This is terrific.
Our first dinosaurs.
(Screech)
These Ornithomimus Will soon be extinct, too, unless, of course, Nigel can save one.
I'd love a breeding herd of Ornithomimus, but We need a technique for catching them.
And I think this Will Work.
I've done it With ostriches.
You slip a sock over their head.
As soon as you cover their eyes, they calm down.
The only trouble I've got is that these things can run at 40 miles per hour.
There's so many in this herd, if I can get in their midst there Will be a commotion and hopefully I can grab hold of one of them.
(Shrieks)
(SquaWks)
(GroWls)
But now there's something else to contend with, something much, much bigger.
Something's chasing them.
It looks like the T-Rex have found Nigel before Nigel could find them.
(Roar)
No sudden moves.
(Roar)
Nigel does have one advantage.
T-Rex is so top heavy, that if they trip, the fall can kill them.
(Roar)
A bite of Nigel isn't worth the risk.
down, mate!
Get down!
(Roar)
That Was a close one.
Predators don't like confined spaces like this.
And that's Why the T-Rex are staying back there, I'm sure.
I think What We've got to do now is go back to camp.
Day One over and there's no T-Rex to take home.
At least there's no sign of the meteorite, either, but it can't be far away.
The following morning, the camp has some visitors.
(Animals growl)
More creatures in the last throes of their existence.
A glorious sight to Wake up to.
A big herd of Triceratops.
This is a tremendous sight.
When the fossils Were found, they named these Triceratops Horridus.
It means "horrid three-horned face", but how could they?
They are gorgeous.
And big, too!
Eight tons.
And one over there, it's a big male, is at least 25 feet, eight metres long.
The good thing for us is there are a lot of them.
They're prey animals for T-Rex.
I've seen tracks of the predator over there.
Prey and predator attracted to Waterholes.
I'm going to follow the tracks and see if We can find a T-Rex lair.
The footprints are fresh and it looks like a well-used track.
T-Rex are fast movers, reaching 40 miles an hour when they need to.
Nigel's hoping these ones aren't too far away.
The tracks are really beginning to tell a story.
Look here.
A depression in the ash.
That Was a big tail sweep.
There Was a kerfuffle here.
Another tail drag over there.
The tracks are going on.
We're getting towards the centre of the territory.
What Nigel doesn't realise is he's already in the centre of their territory!
(Roar)
(Shriek)
Crouch down!
Get over here.
Get down.
This is their home.
There's bones scattered all over.
They obviously bring food back here.
It's terrific.
That kerfuffle back there, that must have been the juveniles fighting over scraps of food.
It's dangerous play.
T-Rex have huge jaw muscles, giving them a bite 1 0 times more powerful than a lion's.
And there's males and females here.
In the fossil record, T-Rex skeletons have been found together.
That's a clue that they associate.
(Roar)
They're a real mob, like a gang looking for trouble.
They really interact.
I Wonder if they hunt in packs.
(Roar)
Suddenly they all started moving this Way.
It's one thing to find a T-Rex, but it's another thing to take one home.
Fortunately, dinosaurs lay eggs and they're a lot easier to carry.
I can go and have a look now, see if We can find any eggs or a nesting site.
Amongst the remains of the T-Rex victims littered across the den,
Nigel finds what he's looking for.
Unfortunately, he's too late.
This is all I can find, empty T-Rex eggshells.
They've been broken into by a predator, or more likely, they're last season's eggs.
It's so disappointing. lf We could have found a fresh nest and got the eggs, that Would have been the easiest option.
Another day and he's still no closer to saving a T-Rex.
And up above are the first signs that the meteorite is closing in.
Streaking across tonight's sky are shooting stars.
Huge boulders plough into the Earth's atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour.
They are the precursor of something much, much bigger.
Look at this cosmological activity.
Those are meteors.
They burn up in the atmosphere, but they're in the bow Wake of the meteorite.
And the meteorite, When that comes, Will smack into the Earth.
That's the problem.
And We really have got such little time here. I'm hoping tomorrow goes better and We can save a T-Rex or two.
The next day, the pack of T-Rex turn up, looking for trouble.
They're after their favourite food - Triceratops.
(Roar)
They're charging for the Triceratops, right in the midst of the herd there.
What the T-Rex Will do is find the Weakest.
A fully-grown Triceratops is far from defenceless.
Their frill is made of solid bone.
But the younger Triceratops know better than to stand their ground.
Aagh.
I feel like I've been hit by a train!
A baby Triceratops has run the wrong way.
The more it struggles, the more trouble it's in as the T-Rex's 1 3-inch serrated teeth sink deeper and deeper.
But help is at hand.
There's a Triceratops here fighting back the big female T-Rex.
(Roar)
The horn's gone right into the upper thigh.
(Screech)
And the males have just left her.
They've just skedaddled.
So much for the pack!
Now the injured female has to make her own kill.
It looks like she's spotted her next victim - another youngster.
(Roar)
For Nigel, it's the chance he's been waiting for.
He sets up the time portal.
Maybe I can get two dinosaur species for the price of one.
If I can lure the Triceratops through the time portal and then maybe the T-Rex Will follow.
Aagh!
Come on!
Come on, T-Rex.
(Roar)
That's certainly not a T-Rex!
But, weighing in at three tons, this young male Triceratops is a great start.
It's not long before news spreads that Prehistoric Park's first dinosaur has arrived.
The park's vet, Suzanne, heads over to take a look for herself.
It's a Triceratops!
It's a Triceratops!
He's done it!
Our first dinosaur, and look at him.
He's magnificent.
Park-keeper Bob is keen to move the newcomer into a secure enclosure.
Whoa!
That's far enough.
Although he was an unexpected arrival,
Nigel thinks they've got the perfect place to put him.
Come on, I need to have a look at that.
Up you go.
Triceratops - our first dinosaur.
We need a good place to keep him.
I Want to call him Theo.
It's a great name.
But he needs vegetation to browse on.
Over here there's too much grass.
So Bob's found the perfect spot, down here by the river.
That's Where his enclosure Will be.
They're just about to unload him.
- how are you, Nigel?
- Thrilled to bits.
Our first dinosaur.
It's short notice, but I forgive you as our new visitor is magnificent, to say the least.
- how's the enclosure?
- A bit makeshift, but it Will do for now.
I've given him a name as Well.
- Theo the triceratops.
- Theo.
Good name.
(Yells) All right!
Let him out!
Here he comes.
Whoa, Whoa!
- (Laughs) Hey!
- Look at that!
Plenty for him to eat.
Well done, Bob. it's great.
All right, lads.
Come on.
Get the boards away and the truck out of there.
(Nigel) Really pleased With this habitat.
Grass is no good for dinosaurs. lt hadn't evolved When they Were around.
Triceratops is not like a coW. lt doesn't graze. lt broWses like a black rhinoceros.
It needs low shrubs and trees.
There's plenty of those for Theo here.
And its beak can snap off branches as thick as my arm.
This is gonna be great for him to thrive.
For Theo to grow to eight tons, he'll have to spend most of his life eating.
With the park's first dinosaur settled,
Nigel turns his attention once again to T-Rex.
And the pressure's back on Bob to finish off the enclosure.
I didn't have a clue how to build a compound for a T-Rex.
I've only seen one in a story book, but Nigel thinks this Will do.
There's lots of area to run around, lots of shade to get out of the sun.
And if it Wants to, it can stand up on the hill and survey its domain.
The enclosure will have to be finished soon because Nigel's on his way back to where he left off... 65 million years ago.
And this time he's promised to return with a T-Rex.
It's not just the dinosaurs that will be wiped out by the meteorite hit.
Nigel knows that everything he sees around him will be devastated.
(Animals squaWk)
What a magnificent place!
Pterosaurs sWooping overhead.
You can hear them calling all the time.
And sweet Water.
It's hard to believe that this stream Will be choked With ash and dust.
The meteorite Will hit not too far away.
Time is running out.
This is my second rescue mission.
I am determined to save some T-Rex for Prehistoric Park.
There are lots of dinosaur tracks to follow, but Nigel is interested in one set in particular.
There's something strange With these tracks.
Look.
The toes have been dragged along.
I think it's the female T-Rex that Was gored in the stampede.
We're close to Where the Triceratops stampede Was.
She's dragged her toes.
She's injured and she'll be moving pretty slowly.
If We head downstream and follow these tracks, We may catch her up.
The track takes him down river, where he's hoping to gain ground on the T-Rex.
With any luck, her leg injury will make her slower and a little easier to catch.
Listen.
Her footfalls are reverberating around the valley.
She's up there somewhere.
And an animal that Weighs six tons can't Walk quietly.
There, that's What she's after.
There's a Triceratops corpse and she can smell that.
That's Why she's been moving along the river.
(Pounding footfalls)
(Whispers) Come on!
Get on the bank.
She's there. I don't Want her to see us.
(Roars)
(High-pitched cry)
She's starting to move away.
I'm certain it's the female that Was attacked by the Triceratops.
She's been able to track down this free meal despite being on her own and badly injured because T-Rex's have a superb sense of smell.
(Roars)
She's in luck.
The triceratops carcass has become stuck.
This is Nigel's chance to get really close to her.
She must be so hungry.
She's desperate for an easy meal.
Even though T-Rex is everyone's ultimate monster, you feel sorry for her.
She's a top predator.
They're so top-heavy.
If she Went in this fast-floWing Water, she'd be flipped over.
But she's desperate for the meat.
You just feel so sorry for her.
She's desperate to get out there, but she's got no chance.
The T-Rex limps off, leaving Nigel to figure out what to do next.
(Bob) Keep the camera on him.
Back at Prehistoric Park,
Theo the Triceratops is displaying some unusual behaviour.
Bob has asked vet Suzanne to come and take a look.
- What is he doing?
- He's done it all morning.
- What do you think it is?
- Haven't a clue.
He just keeps charging at that tree!
Gosh!
Oh, my goodness, look!
What?
Oh, my goodness!
- The poor thing!
- Any ideas?
His frill has changed colour!
It Wasn't like that before.
(GroWls)
Maybe he's having a testosterone surge and he thinks that's a mate and he's charging him.
- You think he needs a playmate?
- l think he thinks that tree's a friend!
- (Laughs)
- What?
I've just had a very good idea.
- What?
Tell me.
- Wait and see.
Oh.
OK.
Thanks, fella.
Just round the side.
Bob has a plan.
He's convinced he can tame even Theo's teenage tantrums.
Meanwhile, Nigel has, at last, come up with a plan of his own.
We're trying a technique used by game capture teams for things like antelope.
The T-Rex is Working her Way down river.
We've got ahead of her.
She Won't go onto uneven ground and she Won't go near the Water.
We've built this palisade of logs and We'll funnel her towards the time portal and back to the safety of the 21 st century.
We hope.
Hi, Adam.
Give us a hand.
The meteorite is getting ever closer.
So is the T-Rex.
And a herd of Ornithomimus are running scared.
(Ornithomimus shriek)
There she is, the T-Rex.
That's Why they're spooked.
(Roars)
(Ornithomimus shriek) lf We're lucky, she'll chase them through the time portal and We can have a breeding colony of Ornithomimus at Prehistoric Park.
Trapped between the T-Rex and the 2 1st century, they opt for the portal.
Yeah, one, two.
They are belting through!
A Whole phalanx of them!
Bob is gonna get a real surprise.
Oh, my giddy aunt!
Nigel, Nigel, What have you done?
Suzanne, We've got a bit of a situation here!
(Shrieks)
But one Ornithomimus is slower than the rest.
Aagh!
(Ornithomimus shrieks)
(Crunch)
That Was close.
She took the Ornithomimus right there.
It's just a snack for her.
It Was a juvenile.
Time's running out.
We must follow her.
With its catch still uneaten, the hungry T-Rex limps off back the way she came.
I can't understand.
Why doesn't she just devour the Ornithomimus?
We cannot afford to lose her.
I do not Want to go back to Prehistoric Park empty-handed.
(Animals SquaWk)
Back at Prehistoric Park,
Bob is settling in the herd of highly-strung Ornithomimus.
They're still a bit stressed out from the capture.
They're Walking round and round the perimeter fence.
They're checking out their new home, but they'll be all right.
I'm not gonna feed them till tomorrow, just let them settle in a bit.
With that job done, Bob's back to his workshop where his plan for the bad-tempered Triceratops is now in full swing.
- (Man) Tie her up.
- We Want that one up there.
Up you go.
You're doing a grand job, but I need this finished this afternoon.
Nigel's still tracking the T-Rex.
She's almost on her last legs.
Moving so slowly now, Nigel's had a chance to catch up.
But where she's going remains a mystery.
Nigel is about to find out.
(Nigel) lt's been a long climb, but Worth it.
There's babies there.
She's badly injured, but the babies need food, so she's brought the Ornithomimus all the Way here.
Palaeontologists suspected that dinosaurs showed parental care.
For us, it's fantastic.
We can get a Whole family of T-Rex back to Prehistoric Park.
But Nigel's optimism is short-lived.
(Roars)
(Roars)
The male really Wants that carcass.
And the young are hiding.
If he sees them, they could be in trouble.
I'm sure, like all reptiles, T-Rex can be cannibalistic.
(Roars)
(Roars)
(Roars)
(Pounding footfalls)
I think she's fully stunned.
The babies, there's no chance for her.
Mum's fallen.
I can't see any movement at all here.
(Roars)
Hundreds of miles away, the meteorite has finally entered the Earth's atmosphere at 20,000 miles an hour.
(Rumbling)
The sonic boom it creates is one of the loudest noises the world has ever known.
(Thunderous boom)
As it strikes the Gulf of Mexico, it causes an explosion seven billion times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.
It releases a blast front moving at a hundred times the speed of sound.
This devastation is just the start.
(Thunderous rumbling)
The cloud of ash will soar into the sky and molten rock will start raining down, igniting global wildfires.
And as it mushrooms out, it will engulf the entire world in a blanket of darkness.
All this is just three minutes away.
Nigel will have to think fast.
Has anyone got any food, anything that smells?
We need the odour to entice the T-Rex babies through the time portal.
I just hope We can make it.
This must Work.
We've only got seconds left.
They should be curious about the meaty smell of the sandwich.
They're more likely to lunge at me and attack me.
Come on.
You've got to come.
We've got to get you back.
That's it, come on.
Yes!
(Thunderous explosions)
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!
There are only two!
Our first T-Rex!
Nigel has finally managed to rescue T-Rex from extinction.
The two T-Rex babies are now safely in the observation pen.
Suzanne is making sure they're in good health before they're taken to their permanent enclosure.
They look undernourished, but Bob Will sort that out.
They're eating really Well.
They're only little, but they're still so powerful, aren't they?
They're cool, aren't they?
(Roars)
Prehistoric Park is now home to its first ever dinosaurs.
But vet Suzanne is concerned that one of them doesn't seem happy about being here.
He really doesn't look very happy.
Not When he stares like that.
He doesn't like me.
Back, Suzanne, he's charging!
You are trying to shake us up.
Theo has got such attitude now!
He's taken such a dislike to you.
He doesn't like you.
I hand-reared a fox before and When it got mature - it Was a male as Well - it started biting and attacking me.
He's mature and his hormones are fizzing through his body.
Too much testosterone.
Males always have to Win!
(Engine Whirs)
- (Suzanne ) My goodness!
- Bob, What have you done now?
At last, Bob's plan is unveiled.
Look at this contraption!
Wa-hey, stop!
Suzanne, get the gates!
This is man's Work!
Guys!
On We go!
Watch out, Theo, We're coming!
Good luck, boys.
You'll need it.
- Come on, Theo!
- Come on!
Where are you?
Oh!
He charged from over there.
He charged from the bamboo!
Bob's contraption is not as daft as it seems.
The tyre-padded tractor is a worthy opponent for Theo, giving him something to take his aggression out on.
It's a tactic gamekeepers use on rhinos.
OK, Bob!
And it looks like it's working giving all the boys a chance to let off steam.
Men!
- Look at him staring us out!
- We're getting at him!
That's Why he's got breeding colours.
It's his first breeding season.
- He'd take on anything!
- He's taking on us!
Yee-haW!
Charge!
(Grunts)
That Was great fun, exhausting Work.
Never thought I'd joust With a Triceratops!
But that's What they did in the Wild.
Look at this.
You can see injuries on the frill and neck.
They had jousting tournaments in nature.
It's keeping our boy occupied!
But he's got to Win every time.
We can't get too excited With him.
I don't Want him to get injured cos he's magnificent!
Nigel's dream of having a park full of prehistoric creatures he's saved from extinction is beginning to take shape.
The Ornithomimus are getting used to their new home.
The Triceratops has calmed down.
And the T-Rex babies have been put into their new enclosure.
- Fantastic.
Well done, Bob.
- lt Wasn't just me, it Was the lads.
It's overkill now, When they're tiny, but When they're big, it's a perfect enclosure.
- Have you seen them at all?
- Not since I put them in there.
There's places for them to hide.
They're not gonna be stressed.
Look, there!
- Give them some names.
- l've done that.
- OK, What?
- Matilda for the big female.
Then Terence, he's a bit puny, for the younger male.
(Bob) Very nice, Nigel.
It's kinda cute really, I guess.
- They're not going to stay cute for long.
- No.
Nigel's right.
The T-Rex will double their body weight every year until full size, turning Terence and Matilda into the most ferocious killing machines for 65 million years.
Let's hope Prehistoric Park knows what it's letting itself in for.
(Roars)
Next time, Nigel sets his sights on a mammoth from the ice Age.
But he's going to have to overcome the cold climate and a hostile reception.
(Roars)
Get these vet samples!
Managing the prehistoric creatures will not be as easy as they first thought.
Close the gate!
Are there ticks?
No
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure
Beautiful
Why all the junk food?
I have a project
I'm gonna try and do while I'm here, and maybe you guys could help
Is that all of the boxes too?
Can you help me with these?
Yeah
Could you get the front door?
Yeah
My keys
Put it down here
Here
Thanks
Found it
Do you guys wanna take a look around the yard?
Okay
Sure
Do you need help with anything?
Oh no, just sit down
It's nice
Do you wanna see your rooms?
Yeah
Hum, by the way...
The phone lines are down, I just...
I haven't had a chance to get around to fixing 'em
It's fine
Linda... your room is down stairs
Bye!
It's a really nice room
I mean, it's a trap
We never leave
What?
Towels
Do we clink, do we say a toast or?
You do not say a toast
You not supposed to clink?
No clinking
The weekend?
Yeah!
Thank you!
Should I serve you?
My uncle was really good with wines
He always come over and start talking about 'em for hours
And so we have to delay dinner's just so we could talk about this grand "wine that he had
I hope he had some " tonight
They have, I don't know, all kinds of food
There's lots of fish and lots of meat
So I was a vegetarian at the time, so I didn't eat anything
But my friend has a " of meat
In like this big"
And this little boy ran up from behind and grab the meat right of the"
And stuck it and his pocket and run off
Oh God!
That's kinda tragic
It was"
It's gorgeous there

Ah, cook books

The joy of cooking!

Once a week we have a meal... some different, exotic dishes
It's nice!
It's a nice tradition

Hella
It seemed like the right time, it's not a big deal
It's the first night!
It was... the conversation...
Whatever
Look, obviously
She...
She doesn't seem upset
Now I feel really bad
Fine, it's over, whatever
No, she hates me
She hates me, doesn't she?
Whatever, just think, it wasn't a big deal
Look at that

No
Yeah, me neither
I've only been blond about a year
"died, I wanna to reflect more light around my head
I want it to be brighter
Like a"
No
Like... a light on the back of my head, like a flashlight
Like the light hitting the back of my head and...
Someone shouting
"Stop!
We've found you
Freeze!
Don't move!
We've found you"

The lines are down

She didn't even tell us about you
Yeah, she did
No, she didn't

Yeah
Same size feet, maybe?
Come with me
They're fraternal
You have to leave
Why?
Come on, please, you just... you have to go
What?
Just...
I've been in the car for three hours!
I don't wanna drive down to New York right now
Hella's fiance just left her two days ago
She's completely crushed
She doesn't seem crushed
It's because she tells that
For me?
I've parked my car on the road, like...
Can someone maybe give me a ride?
Come on, is cold
I don't know, they had a lot to drink
I'm sorry but it's supposed to be girls weekend
Only girls
I never knew you had so many friends
Always keeping 'em from me
Please
OK!
OK!
Thank you!
Jesus!
What you've just said?
Nothing
Yeah, you did.
You just said something
I didn't say anything
You just said something about pizza
No, I didn't
You said like really quick, like, is there pizza or I want pizza
No, I didn't.
I was just siting here
Dude, you just said that.
I swear!
I don't think I said anything
Yes, you did
Really?
I don't know
I don't know, I just thought is something funny
Did I?
Do you?

Pizza

Hey

Good night
Is she in the bath?
I think so
Goodnight Hella
What?
I hear nothing
Sweet dreams
Yes?
Yes what?
You're so weird
But so am I
Feels nice
How long ago did her parents died?
I think two or three years ago
Can I turn this off?
If you don't need it
It's strange that he just left
Yeah
"
I'm lost and thirsty
Do you want some juice?
"Juice"...
Do I look like an infant?
Soda, I want soda
Soda is full of sugar
It's to early
Will make you hipper
Hipper is good
The army likes hipper
Is that what you are?
The army?
Is what I wanna do
My dad wants me to be a medic
My mom wants me to joying the air force, like her dad
And why the army?
Because they are number than marines
Then why go in there at all?
Why not... do something else with your life?
Defending your country is cool
I know all the"
"
"
"
"
How could you be lost?
You're so smart
I am.
Since yesterday
You're right
Where do you live?
I told you, I'm not from around here.
I'm lost
Just camping with my dad
Do you want my help?
Common
My house is right down there
Yeah, right
I was just asking why the army...
Why not be an inventor or something?
Just killing people is more fun
Do you know how many times I've been"
Do you wanna kill me?
No
Why not?
Because...
Because why?
Because your one of me
You're up early
You're up early
I thought you're gonna sleeping for at least in an hour
It's bright here
Do you wanna take a walk with me?
It's okay
Do you have any coffee?
Yeah, sure
I can make it
No, it's fine
But your walk?
Now that you're up I'll stay
Cool
I mean, don't...
I'm just saying 'cause I'm up
What would you doing if I leave?
Have a sleep some more
I might take a walk to, just not right away
Okay
The filters are here
Okay
"
Okay
Have a nice walk
I'm gonna do the video over there
I can do the help
You can run the camera
Sure
Good morning
Hi!
Hi!
I'm just gonna go wash up
You found the tea
I'd like to put a pool in here
That would be great
How can't you see with your glasses so dirty?
They are dirty
Why don't you have any help?
Help?
Yeah, someone to bring me things
They don't need me that much
Besides, even if I could afford I didn't wanna...
Is that what you want?
I might
My turn
She's a natural
What's your brother do again?
Writer
He's in a middle of a " novel
Really?
I thought... he was in a band, I thought they're doing well
He wishes
He's so weird
He went to see this unicorn when he was ten at the circus is all I wanted to see
But turn up the unicorn... is just a poor goat
Who's horn have been bound together into one
I think it screwed him up
What's up with her?
Please don't use the phone
I told you, the lines are down
But this one works, it just needed to be bugged in
Who do you need to call?
I was just checking my messages
I know
I know, I just " be nice if "no phone for a few days, okay?
You got some great books in this library
Did you see this?
"
Yeah
So, it's on the agenda
How long does it been in your family?
Is not that old and my grandmother...
We had a library that was five hundred years old
I got too much sun today
"
"
What's that?
Something to play
What is it?
- It's like...
- An sombrero!
Boy soccer, 1999
Sorry!
You murderer!
How's the skirt on me?
It's really unflattering
I just wanted to say!
Oh my God!
Round one
"
Grace could you zip me up?
"
You fit perfectly, actually
This dress looks nice
My mother's
Could you change the music, please?
It's better with my hair up
Change this music!
Alright!
Okay!
Okay!
- I'm sorry!
- Pardon me!
You totally in my way!
Fuck!
Aw, stupid aw!
"
What did you do?
No, no, no
"
I'm sorry!
It's not your fault
No, leave me alone
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
- Where is that?
- Turn down the music, turn down the music!
Okay!
Do you hear that?
What is that?
- That's over here
- Spy the doors, spy the doors, spy the doors!
No!
Don't!
No, is definitely out here
No
I can hear!
I can hear, is out here!
- Uh, it's here
- No!
It's over here!
Let's go, let's go!
Listen, it's like they hide in a book shelf
You better keep your glasses on
No, it's here!
It's out back!
- It's here!
- She's right!
Look the doors!
It's totally here!
- Let's go see
- I know
"
- Maybe we should go outside...
- No
Can't go outside, don't leave the house!
Listen!
Hella!
Hella!
- No, it's here
- No...
It's here!
It's staying here!
No, it's over here!
Get out!
Listen, listen, listen!
Megan?
Where is it?
!
It's here!
No...
Yeah, it's here, it's here, listen
"
Check that closet
You going outside?
!
Come here
It's upstairs!
Shit!
Common!
It's upstairs!
No, it's not!
Where is it going?
It's in the library!
It's in the library!
- It's in the library!
- It's in the library!
"
No!
Don't open the door!
It's in the kitchen!
Go, go!
Shh!
It stopped!
It's here!
You guys!
Megan!
Downside?
I'm not sure
Let's go
It's out there!
Come!
I think it's over here!
It's over here, it's over here!
Grace?
Fuck you!
It's upstairs
We should go
Come on!
Grace don't defy me!
Where it go?
It's in the fireplace
What?
It's in the fireplace
Is?
It's in the fireplace, everyone!
Listen, Listen!
Where this clothes come from?
I've just been collecting them
I think I can hear it
"
I can't hear
No, it's gone
It's not
It is, that's just the rain
- Where it come from?
- Where did you go, where do you go, where do you go...
I'm tired
We should name him
Timothy
Megan, what was that?
Timothy
Timothy
Timothy
Megan
- Megan
- Yeah
What was that?
I don't know
You should know
I've never heard it before
They're growing!
"You can do it harder
"
You are so good at this
I was in massage school for a second
We rubbed each other all day long and then I go to anatomy
And I realise from the pictures...
All I was doing is tenderizing meat and fat
I felt like a butcher and I quit
Well done
Anyone else?
No, thanks
How is this sound?
"We'll be back tomorrow.
Might be too tired to hang, we'll see"
Sounds fine
I know but should I say "I might be back" or "I will be back"?
Just say what you want, it's sounds fine
Maybe I don't want him to know I'll be back
I mean, I want him to know.
I wanna see him tomorrow, but...
I want to think for just a second that maybe we won't see each other
To so... he wanna see me even more
That's ridiculous, Linda
Just tell 'em
What?
Tell 'em the truth
That you'll be back and you want to see 'em
Tell 'em that you love 'em and you want to see him all the time
Really?
Yes
Hm...
No, this is fine
Is time to work
Hella?
Grace?
Can we do the video now?
Yeah
Yeah, I'll...
I'll go get the starving babies
The what?
Grace"
You'll be over there, Linda
How's it looking?
Good
Yeah, you have a couple feet to the left
And you're out of frame
There!
Okay!
Good!
More towards the center!
Are we wearing the hats?
No hats
Done
You're at the edge of the frame, right there!
So this is the edge?
Walk straight ahead!
Stop!
Okay!
Were did all the clouds come from?
You were sleeping
It's one of those crazy summer storms
It will pass
Just start over here
"
"
How do I know which is which?
Just make it up
They're all in the frame?
Yeah, I already said that
You have to act like you're doing something great
Like you're really helping the starving babies out
Okay
You're proud... but, do it delicately
Okay
Are they crying?
They're starving
They can't cry
But if they could... they would
Are you ready?
Hi
Hi
I don't think they're acting hot enough
It's Africa and they're not acting hot enough
You should tell them
So it's suppose to be ironic?
Hi Megan!
Hi Sarah!
How's it going?
It's good!
Good, how are you?
I'm good
I saw this out my window
You're living"
I'll be right back!
Are we done?
Sure
Are your parents coming up?
No
We're living tomorrow
"
I'm thirsty
Me too
Who is that?
I just came by to say hello
I'll go get you guys some water
I don't know
I'm doing things
And I love without pear
Get a little bit lonely sometimes
I know you do
Todd is coming up in a few days
Is that is?
Looks so big
Is for further things
It's reminds me of all that stuff
Have you seen the gardens here?
No
You should
Okay
Want some?
My dad asked about you the other day
Yeah
Yeah
He misses your parents
They're close
It's weird
They're really close
It's fucked
How's the " coming along?
"
The mess will get fixed
Maybe you should come over tomorrow morning
For breakfast
Okay
Bring some vegetables
Sounds nice
Your pants
You change them on your walk the other morning
I saw you from the kitchen going and coming, they're all different color
Maybe... see?
You like them?
I made them
I can make some for you
Bye!
Bye
Been there
Are you afraid to dying?
Don't ever say die
You just seem like someone who isn't
I'm not
You say that like it's nothing
It is nothing
Would you return this to the chair?
She has a horse and now she got's a new pony
- Beautiful, and she has a " chicken...
- So she lives all alone there?
She had a fiance
But he left her
It's sad
I wish I had a fiance
In your twenties?
I thought she was wearing a ring
But she has to let go
I think that she wanted to buy this lot too, but...
I helped her
So you actually build this house?
Yeah, I had build
I thought it was old
No, it's new
I really like how the doors have no door nobs
Well, I guess it is new
Is just strange, I thought it was old
- Do you need any help?
- Nope
No but thanks
Does anyone need tea?
Please
Thanks
Haven't notice too many insects
Lots of"
Usually the first one to get bitten
There's one
Did you know that it used to be " clouds?
The size of Rhode Island?
That big?
Yeah, they used to " from miles and miles
Then one year they just didn't come
They never came again
Ever?
Not like that
They still exist
But...
Yeah...
Not in forms that size
What happened?
They just found out
Like last year
I guess is part of their cycle
They fly away north
Closer to the arctic
And in the"
It's totally melting now
They discovered this huge spread out thin layer of "and"
Was like a layer of them
Trapped
Like a " of black
Like a blanket of insects
I never imagined where those things come from
I hear about them
I assumed that's just... sweep down from the sky
I think about where they go when they're not here
Don't they fly that far every year?
It was early
The storm
That'll never been a storm like that, that early
It sucks for them
"
Millions of them fools like that!
Instant fools, instant freeze, instant fools!
Don't
Don't
It's a scary thought
"
You'll be back in school soon
Yeah
Are you looking forward to getting back?
I don't really feel like I left
Of course you do
No
I'm sorry
And what about?
I'm glad you can make it up, though
You have to do it again
Yeah
I want you to meet my parents when we get back
I think you'll like them
Sure
I'm sleepy
I'm going up
Okay
Tell Grace I said goodnight
Okay
Thanks for your help today
It should be good
Yeah, it was fun
It wasn't supposed to be fun
No, I know
You do?
I know, I got it
Turn that crap off
Where you smoking?
Just one
She's 26, not 25
Hey
Rise and shine!
We have to tell you something
Yeah?
Gas?
Power?
Water?
Telephone?
I have no idea what you're talking about, you guys
- I'm sorry
- Just look at it!
Please, just look at it
And the dates
Well, maybe...
I don't want to talk to her
Oh God!
I know it's early but if we don't do this now
That was like taken what?
Three months ago?
And this is like
Yeah...
I mean...
Why would she?
Exactly
Why would she
Don't make a big deal out this, I don't...
What you mean?
How we not make a big deal?
- " I don't understand what is this...
- Okay, Grace is like...
You told me you didn't were glasses
I lied
We know
I knew you guys were on your way up here
The crystals...
Hella?
One day will awake into discover, your life is all you wanted
And hoped it will be
You're not find everything just the way your head said you wanted it
It might be not the way you planned
But you'll awake into your dreams
Your dreams of joy
Love
And peace
Your dream of freedom
You'll see beyond the illusions
You'll transcend your old limiting beliefs
You'll wake up and notice that your past is just as it needed to be
You'll see where you are today is good
You'll look at tomorrow with peace, faith and hope
Knowing that while you can not control some of what life does
You have possibilities, and powers in any circumstances life might bring
The struggle you have lived with for so many years
The struggle in your heart
Has disappeared
You're secure
At peace with yourself
And your place in this world
One day, you'll awake into your heart's contentment
Let that day be today
Thank you
I really loved what she said
Would you like to come to my country house?
With me and some of my friends this weekend?
It sounds lovely!
Where they go?
They said they couldn't take the fresh air anymore
And we never going back
It's all I lived for
Did you hear about that boy?
Got lost around here for like, four days
They just found them
Is he okay?
Yeah, they're saying he keeps saying
He saw this woman and she refused to help
They're saying he had a vision
That she wasn't real
Look
She said,
"Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
Careful.
When did we last wash that sweater?
Right after the war.
Christmas.
In the '50s sometime or the '60s.
Shut up.
I'll go make the fire.
"You climbed the bank and said,
"'This is how you touch other women,
"the grass cutter's wife, the lime burner's daughter.
"And you searched your arms for the missing perfume and knew..."
Don't worry, darling.
I expect I'm just losing my mind.
"What good is it to be the lime burner's daughter,
"left with no trace
"as if not spoken to in the act of love,
"as if wounded without the pleasure of a scar.
"You touched your belly to my hands in the dry air
"and said, 'I am the cinnamon peeler's wife.
Smell me.'"
When I look away, I forget what yellow means.
But I can look again.
Sometimes there's something delicious in oblivion.
I think you're supposed to be able to put your fingers inside the curled petal and feel the heat.
Well?
I can't be sure.
I can't be sure if what I can feel is the heat or my imagination.
The heat attracts the bugs.
Nature never fools around just being decorative.
Yes?
I don't quite know how to introduce myself.
I used to see your husband at Meadowlake.
I'm a regular visitor there myself.
Those are lovely flowers.
I've never seen those purple ones before.
The earth there must really appeal to them.
What?
You could just open the drawers.
Remind yourself.
What?
Maybe all the labels and lists are defeating the purpose.
If you stopped thinking about things the moment you write them down, maybe that's the end of your need to recall.
I heard a story at a dinner party about the German soldiers on border patrol in Czechoslovakia during the war.
I heard it from that Czech student of yours.
Veronica.
We spoke once at a dinner party.
Don't be nervous.
It's a good story.
She told me that each of the German patrol dogs wore a sign saying "hund."
"Why?" said the Czechs.
And the Germans replied, "Because that is a hund."
It was one of those craft shows where you look around and wonder that the laws of supply and demand can allow for the production of so many macramé ducks.
Oh, God, those things are everywhere.
- What do you do with them?
- Come on, Phoebe, you've got one of those.
You use it as a... what do you call it... a light fixture holder or som...
- I do not.
- Phoebe, in the...
Oh, yes.
Wait a second, I do.
Fiona gave it to me.
Yes, I did.
Would anybody like some more?
Ween...
Wai...
Wain...
No, but I'll have a touch of wine.
Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.
Some more wain.
The thing is... half the time I wander around looking for something which I know is very pertinent.
I can't remember what it is.
Once the idea is gone, everything is gone.
I just wander around trying to figure out what it was that was so important earlier.
I think I may be beginning to disappear.
And what year is it?
2003.
Fiona, if you found a letter on the street, addressed, with a stamp on it, what would you do with it?
I'd mail it.
And where would you put it to mail it?
And if there was a fire in a movie theater, and you were the first person to spot that fire, what would you do?
Well, we don't go to the movies much anymore, do we, Grant?
All those multiplexes showing the same American garbage.
Have you seen my coat?
There it is, dear.
It's on your chair.
Oh, yes.
Fiona, would you mind if I asked you a few more questions?
Would you mind taking a seat?
I was just feeling a little cold, that's all.
What an ugly baby.
When did we move into this cottage?
Was it last year or the year before?
No.
It was longer than that.
It was when I left the university, 20 years ago.
Well, that's shocking.
Let's just see how it goes, shall we?
How is your husband doing?
Okay.
He and my wife struck up quite a close friendship.
I heard about that.
So, uh,
I'd like to speak to you about something.
If you have a minute.
My husband did not try to start anything with your wife, if that's what you're getting at.
He did not try to molest her.
He's incapable of it.
And anyway, he wouldn't.
From what I hear, it was the other way around.
No, uh, that isn't it at all.
I didn't come here with any complaints.
Oh.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.
Maybe you should come in.
It's not as warm a day as it looks.
"Never let a person make you feel guilty for your anger with God."
Hmm.
Random.
I can't even see what the point is.
We can't be certain this is what...
You're far too young.
"Should the patient afflicted with the disease
"remain at home... the caregiver will very often be the spouse."
"The caregiver must preside over the degeneration
"of someone he or she loves very much,
"must do this for years and years
"with the news always getting worse, not better,
"must put up sometimes with deranged
"but at the same time very personal insults,
"and must somehow learn to smile through it all.
"Caregivers must be able to diagnose
"a wide variety of ordinary ailments
"under extraordinary circumstances.
"Imagine the person you love the most
"suddenly upset about something,
"but completely unable to communicate the problem or even to understand it himself."
Sounds like a regular marriage.
Hello, there!
Oh!
Hello, there.
We are at that stage, Grant.
We are at that stage.
Well... if we do think of it... if we do... then it must be as something that isn't permanent.
A kind of experimental treatment or... a rest cure of sorts.
All right.
All right.
We can think of it that way.
We have to sit in the kitchen, where I can hear Aubrey.
Well, you might as well have a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
My son put him on the Sports Channel a year ago Christmas.
I don't know what we'd do without it.
Must be a struggle.
Well, you know.
You know what struggle is by now.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
You don't want to just get a sense of the place?
I don't want to make this decision alone.
What place?
Just kidding!
Fuck off.
You're not making this decision alone, Grant.
I've already made up my mind.
Okay.
It's time to go home now.
- No, no.
- Mrs. Taylor...
- Hi.
Is this your son?
- Yeah.
I'm her son.
Hi.
I'm Betty.
It's time for your bath.
- Bath.
- Yeah.
You have to have a bath now.
Mama.
Mr. Andersson?
Madeleine Montpelier.
- I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.
- Hi, there.
I'm just going to take you on the quick tour of the facility, and then we can sit down and discuss Mrs. Andersson's condition and the appropriate time for admitting her.
As you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Yes, I can see that.
This is my favorite room.
Look, over there, as you can see, they have a puzzle on the go.
They always have a puzzle on the go.
- This works.
- You know, it's real important to us here that our residents maintain social function, so a lot of our activities and our whole layout is really geared toward...
Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.
Hello, Michael.
Now, as you can see, we're coming into our common room, and again, we're really emphasizing everybody being social.
So you can bring the family.
Everybody can come and visit.
We have a state-of-the-art entertainment system so the residents can gather and watch together.
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, Madeleine.
- I got a Christmas sweater.
Aren't you festive!
And this is our quiet corner for crafts and reading and reflection.
We have a lot of activities for physical activity.
Balloon badminton and sit and fit.
And here we have our lovely new dining room.
We can accommodate any dietary preferences or restrictions.
We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner early for the families.
The old Meadowlake is just next door, and that's a day center now, but, um... this for the permanent residents.
This is brand-spanking new.
So let's go upstairs, shall we?
Just taking my tea for a ride.
Oh, look at this one, Flo.
He's a real charmer, isn't he?
Would you say, are you a charmer?
I think you could say I was kind of a charmer.
You're a rascal.
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.
I should have known it.
At this age, it's...
What do the kids call it, Flo?
It's...
It's a real clusterfuck.
All the charmers are taken.
Or dead.
Mostly dead.
You're kind of charming yourself, sweetheart.
Shall we?
This is our second floor, the extended care wing.
The elevators, of course, have the lockdown system, and this is where the patients can move to once they become more progressed.
Interesting choice of words.
Why don't I show you some of the rooms here, while we're at it?
Then we can go back down and see the regular rooms where Mrs. Andersson will be living.
No, that will not be necessary.
My wife will not be progressing to this floor.
All right.
Who chooses the music?
I'm sorry?
I'm assuming it's not the residents.
I don't see any of them singing along.
Yeah, well.
You know the rooms on the regular floors all have their own stereo systems so the patients can listen to whatever they like.
How kind.
Now, we don't admit anyone during the month of December, so Mrs. Andersson will have to wait till January to make the big move.
Just December, Christmas, you know, too many emotional pitfalls.
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.
I'm looking for those documents on Aubrey Burke.
Sure.
Go ahead.
Mr. Andersson, this is Kristy, our new managing nurse.
Against some people's better judgment.
Now, now.
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Mrs. Andersson, who will be joining us in January.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
We also have a policy, which I'm sure you saw in the brochure, that our new residents are not allowed visitors or receiving phone calls during the first 30 days, just to give them a chance to settle in.
What sort of visitors?
Everyone.
Even close relatives.
I couldn't just leave her here.
We understand, it is very difficult to leave a loved one in a new environment for so long, but most people need that time to settle in.
Before we had this rule in place, residents would forget again and again why they were being left here.
Whereas we find, you give them the month to settle in, and they're happy as clams.
And after that, a little visit home every now and then, perfectly fine.
We'll take good care of her, I promise.
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, no!
Not again.
Knock-knock.
Boo.
- She's bringing two babies.
- Two babies?
She's got a new baby, four months old.
Smells good.
I was going to go for a ski, but I thought I shouldn't chance it, what with the Alzheimer's and all.
Why didn't you wake me?
What are these, Grant?
Those are the documents you're supposed to sign if you decide to go to Meadowlake.
That is exactly what I have decided.
You were to go and sign these and leave them there.
I wouldn't be allowed to visit you for 30 days.
30 days isn't such a long time after 44 years.
I don't think I like the place.
I don't think we should be looking for something we like, Grant.
I don't think we'll ever find that.
I think all we can aspire to in this situation is a little bit of grace.
I suppose I'll be dressed up all the time.
It will be sort of like... in a hotel.
How do I look?
Just like always.
Just as you've always looked.
And how does that look?
Direct and vague... sweet and ironic.
Is that how I look?
Oh.
Remember?
Surprised, Grant?
No, I'm not surprised.
I'm just grateful you can remember that.
I'm not all gone, Grant.
Just... going...
There are things I wish would go away.
But won't.
You know.
Things we don't talk about.
You never left me.
You still made love to me, despite disturbing demands elsewhere.
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.
What could you do but be a part of the time you were a part of?
All those pretty girls.
Didn't seem like anyone was willing to be left out.
I think you did all right, compared to some of your colleagues.
Those who left their wives.
And the women who wouldn't put up with it.
I think people are too demanding.
People want to be in love every single day.
What a liability.
And then that silly girl.
That silly girl Veronica.
Girls that age are always going around saying they're going to kill themselves.
But that was that.
Promised me a new life.
We moved out here, that is exactly what you gave me.
How long ago was that?
20 years.
God, that's shocking.
So you see, I'm going... but I'm not gone.
- Fiona.
- Grant.
Don't go.
That's what is happening, Grant.
It's happening... right now.
Fiona.
Hello.
I'm checking in today.
My name is Fiona Andersson.
Yes, Mrs. Andersson.
We have your room all ready for you.
- Perfect.
- We'll have our supervisor,
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.
I'll go fetch her.
She's expecting you.
Thank you.
Fiona.
Grant.
I can't go away from you like this.
We had nothing to tie us down, Grant.
You could have just driven away and forsaken me.
But you didn't.
I thank you for that.
- Mrs. Andersson.
- Oh, hello.
- How do you do?
I'm Madeleine.
- Hello.
Should I give you two a moment?
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.
All right, then, well, we'll get you settled in your room, and then I'd like to give you a tour of the facility.
- That'd be lovely.
Thank you.
- Right this way.
So, as you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Here we go.
Yes.
This'll do just fine.
Good.
I'm so glad you like it.
Now, is... is this all you brought with you today?
- For now.
- We'll see how it goes.
Well, if you need any help arranging things, you just let me know.
Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.
Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say good-bye to my husband.
We haven't been apart for a month for the last 44 years.
It could be quite something.
Okay.
Please, Fiona.
Grant.
Fiona...
You know what I'd like?
I'd like to make love, and then I'd like you to go.
Because I need to stay here, and if you make it hard for me,
I might cry so hard I'll never stop.
Go now.
Go now.
"All of the officers
"were from outside the local area,
"and it probably had not entered their minds
"that almost all of us were named McDonald.
"Nobody moved except for the shuffling of feet.
The red roo"...
Hey.
- Hello, there.
- Kristy.
We met on your tour.
How's Mrs. Andersson?
Has she settled in?
I'm wondering if I could have a moment of your time to ask your advice?
Oh, sure.
I was just reading to Mr. Burke here.
Maybe when we finish this chapter,
I can come find you in the dining room?
Sure.
That's fine.
"The red roof lights revolved in the afternoon sun, and even the dogs were temporarily quiet."
Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.
Now, how can I help you?
Going down the center of the dining room...
That's Frank.
He used to be the play-by-play guy for the Winnipeg Jets.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He loved his job too much to retire.
Frank's on the second floor.
I just...
My wife has always been sort of a different sort of person.
I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be confirmed until after...
And on our way here today, we passed this conservation area where we went for a walk last spring.
And there were these gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.
Oh, those are beautiful, aren't they?
Yes, they really made an impression, see?
And even though the whole place was covered in snow, she said, "Oh, remember?"
Now, that was...
that was... quite recently.
And isn't the short-term memory the thing that goes first?
Well, yeah, but not all at once.
And what's comforting is the long-term memory sometimes stays for quite a long time.
Yeah, her long-term memory seems quite intact.
But when she mentioned that, about the skunk lilies, it was all I could do not to turn the truck around.
What if this is just her just being herself?
She's far too young to...
She is young.
And it is hard.
No doubt about that.
A month is a real long time.
I mean, between you and me, I don't know about the policy myself.
I think it makes it easier for the staff is what I think.
Look.
I'll give you my pager number.
You can call me whenever you want.
You can call me every day if you feel like it.
I don't know what to do.
Mr. Andersson, your wife wrote you this note, and she asked me to pass it along.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Throughout much of the thinking brain, gooey plaques now crowd neurons from outside the cell membranes."
"And knotty tangles mangle microtubal transports from inside the cells."
"All told, tens of millions of synapses dissolve away."
"Because the structures and substructures of the brain
"are so highly specialized,
"the precise location of the neuronal loss determines what specific abilities will become impaired."
"It is like a series of circuit breakers in a large house, flipping off one by one."
That's a great-looking coffee maker.
I always meant to get one of those.
I saw they had them on sale at Canadian Tire.
They gave it to us, my son and his wife.
They live in Kamloops, B.C.
They send us more stuff than we can handle.
Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money to come see us instead.
I suppose they're busy with their own lives.
Not so busy they couldn't go to Hawaii last year.
I mean, you could understand it if there was someone in the family closer at hand, but, uh... he's the only one.
People do get lonely, especially when they're deprived of seeing someone they care about.
Fiona, for instance.
My wife.
I thought you said you went and visited her.
I do.
No, that's not it.
She's really settling in well.
Good.
Good.
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow, Mr. Andersson.
Right.
So I'll see you tomorrow morning, then.
Now, remember, she may be a little surprised to see you.
Don't be shaken by that.
Just...
She hasn't seen you in a while.
She's sort of settled in here.
I understand.
There you are.
I'll walk you down to her.
Wow.
Narcissus this early.
You must have spent a fortune.
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Andersson.
It's great to see you.
I'm gonna help you find your sweater, Mrs. Albright.
All right.
Here we are.
There is her room, right over there.
You remember from last time you were here, don't you?
Her nameplate's right on the door.
I'll leave you to it.
There she is.
Now you just go over and say hello, and try not to startle her...
Remember, she may not...
Well, just go ahead.
Bridge.
Deadly serious.
Quite rabid about it.
I can remember being like that at college for a while.
My friends and I would cut class and sit in the common room and smoke and play like cutthroats.
One's name was Phoebe.
I don't remember the others.
Phoebe Hart.
Oh, you knew her, too.
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?
I'm afraid the coffee's not up to much here.
I don't drink tea.
Oh.
I brought you some flowers.
I thought they might do to brighten up your room.
I went to your room, but you weren't there.
Well, no, I'm here.
So you've made a new friend.
Oh, that's just Aubrey.
The funny thing is I knew him years and years ago.
He used to work in the store, the hardware store where my grandpa used to shop.
He and I were always kidding around, but he never could get up the nerve to ask me out.
Until the very last weekend, he took me to a ball game.
But my grandpa showed up to drive us home.
I was up visiting for the summer.
Visiting my grandparents.
They lived in a cottage on a lake.
Fiona, I know where your grandparents lived.
It's where we lived.
We live.
Really?
I'd better go back.
He thinks he can't play without me sitting there.
It's silly.
I hardly know the game anymore.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Will you be through soon?
We should be.
I mean, it depends.
If you asked that grim-looking lady over there nicely, she'll get you a cup of tea.
- No, I'm fine.
- I can leave you, then?
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.
But you'll be surprised how soon you get used to it.
You'll get to know who everybody is, except that some of them are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?
Can't expect them all to get to know who you are.
Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.
What do you think?
Do you think I'd look good with red hair?
You caught her at sort of a bad moment, involved in a game.
She isn't even playing.
Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.
Now, who is Aubrey?
That's who he is, Aubrey.
You know, they get these attachments.
That kind of takes over for a while.
Best buddy kind of thing.
Sort of a phase.
Does she even know who I am?
No, she might not.
Not today, and then, tomorrow you never know.
Things change back and forth all the time.
You'll see the way it is once you get used to coming here.
You'll learn not to take it so personal.
Learn to take it day by day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll have to go and fix that now.
Here's Yung Menenikenaha, desperately clinging to his one-stroke lead.
Here's the swing.
It doesn't look good.
Looks like he's pushed it out to the right.
It lands 25 feet from the green.
This must be disappointing.
It doesn't look good for Yung Menenikenaha.
He was three strokes on the happy side of par until these last three holes.
Look at you, Mr. Andersson.
I think you might be one of our most frequent visitors.
Hi, Fiona.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
I brought you some books.
They don't seem to have an awful lot around here.
Letters from Iceland by Auden.
We always meant to read that together, didn't we?
Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?
Well, I don't know.
Um, Aubrey's card game starts in a few minutes, and then we usually go walking, and then he does his drawing...
Or perhaps you can find a bit of time later on.
Um, I'll stay here.
Or I'll come back in a few hours.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
Up comes Kapanen...
Boy, oh, boy!
Here we are at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.
It's sudden-death overtime.
They're tied 2-2.
Here are the Leafs again, led by Andreychuk.
He carries it over the blue line, winds up a shot right on!
The bounce, the rebound comes back behind the net.
McCabe couldn't get to it.
It goes back on the left wing and here come the Flyers led by Roenick again.
Roenick and Mitchell, what a twosome this two has been.
A shot right on!
Oh, it just went wide.
- Go for it, Frank.
- Over to the right side.
Here we go again.
The Leafs again.
Here's Sundin carrying it up over the line.
Can't get a shot away and it's cleared away by Philadelphia.
A loose puck grabbed by Philadelphia over on the left wing...
I just came down to say Aubrey is having his nap if you'd like to, um, talk.
Oh, sure.
Can we go somewhere a little more private?
...the side with Mitchell.
He shoots, he scores!
If...
If you'd like.
And Philly wins this series by a score of 3-2.
That's it this season for the Leafs.
Look at Phil Hitchcock.
Is he a happy coach.
Philadelphia wins 3-2.
The game is over in sudden-death overtime.
Y-You said you had some books for me?
This.
Letters from Iceland.
Yes, yes.
You said by Auden.
Yes.
That's right.
Now... where is Iceland?
Well, Iceland is in the middle of the Atlantic.
It's an island.
Youngest country in the world.
It's constantly erupting.
Volcanoes, earthquakes.
It's always shaking itself off.
Wouldn't it be nice to come from a young country?
You do.
That's where you're from.
That's where your people are from.
They immigrated here in the late 1800s.
But that's where you're from, Fiona.
And I teach...
Well, I taught the myths from there.
Norse mythology.
l-I must have been there, then.
Have I been there?
No.
Oh.
Why not?
Wasn't I curious?
You were very curious.
Very curious.
You always said there ought to be one place that you knew about and you thought about and maybe even longed for, but you did never did get to see.
Did I say that?
Yes, you said that.
Well, I'd better go and see to Aubrey.
He'll be wanting a little walk around, I suppose.
It was nice chatting.
You'll be back again tomorrow, I suppose?
Fiona, what are you doing...
What are you doing with Aubrey?
He doesn't confuse me.
He doesn't confuse me at all.
Well, it's been nice chatting.
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
These affections between residents, do they ever go too far?
Well, that depends on what you mean.
The problem we have here, it's funny.
It's actually often the ones who haven't been friendly with each other at all.
I mean, they maybe don't even know each other beyond knowing, like, is it a man or is it a woman?
And you'd think it'd be the old guys trying to crawl in bed with the old ladies, but half the time it's the other way around.
It's the old ladies going after the old men.
It could be they aren't so worn out.
Now don't get me wrong.
I don't mean Fiona.
Fiona is a lady.
She's a real lady.
I sometimes wonder...
You wonder what?
I wonder if she isn't putting on some kind of... charade.
A what?
Some kind of act.
Maybe some kind of punishment.
Why would she do that?
Oh.
Are you getting tired?
- No.
- Are you certain...
Excuse me.
Yes, Mr. Andersson?
How can I help you?
Fiona's wearing someone else's sweater.
Well, it's pretty, isn't it?
No, it's not pretty.
It's tacky.
- She would never wear it.
- Well, I'll tell you what.
You can talk to the duty attendant on Mrs. Andersson's wing.
Boy, it's a marvel, really, the way she's getting him up and out of that chair.
Can you manage?
Will you be all right?
I'll be back in a second.
Fiona, I'm your husband.
Fiona, it's Grant.
We've been married for 45 years.
Look at me, Fiona.
That is not your sweater.
We had a good life together.
Those are your words, Fiona, not mine.
That is not your sweater.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm coming straight back.
I'm coming straight back.
It's going to be all right.
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
Please... don't.
Please, please don't.
You're very persistent, aren't you?
I wish I...
Wish I knew what...
We'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
You're not doing too well, are you?
Well, no big surprise.
What we're handling isn't so easy.
I thought when I married,
I'd be with someone to the final stretch.
I'm betting you thought the same.
Well, didn't work out.
So, I, uh, think you're here for a reason.
I'm the kind of person you can say things flat out to, so shoot.
I wonder if you would consider taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake, maybe just for a visit.
Or I suppose I could take Aubrey out there myself.
I wouldn't mind that at all.
Homemade.
Really?
No.
No, I can't do that.
And the reason is I don't want to upset him.
But wouldn't he understand it was just a visit?
He understands everything.
Now, if I go to all that trouble,
I'd prefer to take him someplace that'd be more fun?
It would make more sense to take him to the mall where there are kids and whatnot.
And then I'd have to get him all ready, maneuver him into the car.
He's a big man.
He's not that easy to manage.
Even if I agreed to do it?
You couldn't do it.
You don't know him.
You couldn't manage him.
And he wouldn't stand your doing for him.
And after all that, what would he get out of it?
Smoke?
No.
No, thanks.
What, did you never, or did you quit?
I quit.
How long ago?
Oh, 30 years, maybe more.
I quit quitting.
Just made a resolution to quit quitting, that's all.
So your wife's depressed, huh?
What's her name again?
I forget.
Fiona.
And how old were you when you met?
She was 18.
Holy, that's pretty young to get married, eh?
Wasn't my idea.
You mean she proposed to you?
Well, that's lovely, that's what I think.
How'd she do it?
She hadn't planned it necessarily.
We were in Tobermory waiting for the ferry to Manitoulin, and it was miserable and rainy, and she was in a good mood.
She didn't want any part of my sour mood.
And what'd she do, what'd she say?
Well, she said, "Do you think it'd be fun...
Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I shouted yes.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
You know, nothing can take away what's happened to you and what you've experienced.
I don't think so, anyway.
Even if it goes away somehow, it's still there.
It's still what you are.
It's curious.
What's curious?
All of that "madly in love" business.
The beginning.
I hear myself tell the story, and it all sounds so crucial.
I suppose it is.
But compared to what we ended up with, until recently... all of that seems so superficial somehow.
Not such a fun place to visit, eh?
Excuse me?
Not such a fun place to visit.
Fucking depressing.
No offense.
None taken.
No one came to visit you, huh?
That must suck huge.
Well, it would suck huge, but I don't live here.
I'm just visiting someone.
Who?
Which one?
Beautiful woman with the shock of hair.
The one sitting with her husband?
- You might say that.
- Why wouldn't you?
I wouldn't say that because I'm her husband.
So why aren't you sitting with her, then?
Just learned to give her some space.
She's in love with that man she's sitting with.
I don't like to disturb her.
I just like to see her, I suppose.
Make sure she's doing well, you know?
I suppose that must seem rather pathetic.
I should be so lucky.
Come on.
She's not here.
She's sick.
He's not here, either.
I brought you a book.
It's all about Iceland.
Thought you might like to take a look at it.
Why, thank you.
Oh, what is it, dear heart?
What is it?
Oh, I see.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here, here, yes.
Do you by any chance have any influence around here?
I've seen you talking to them.
Oh.
We'll get to see each other.
You'll see.
We have to.
I'll come and see you, and you'll come and see me.
You know, I just wish his wife would hurry up and get here.
I wish she'd get him out of here and cut the agony short.
Should I stay?
Don't worry.
She's not sick, you know.
To keep her company.
Well, they have to learn to get over these things by themselves.
They've got short memories, and that's not always so bad.
Okay?
Fiona.
Her name is Fiona.
And what's yours?
I don't think I was ever told that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's Grant.
Hello, Grant.
I'm Marian.
Well, now that we know each other's name,
I can tell you straight out what I'm thinking.
I don't know if he's still so stuck on seeing your... seeing Fiona.
I don't ask him, he doesn't tell me.
But I don't feel like putting him back in there in case it turns out to be more than that.
I don't want him getting hard to handle.
I don't have any help.
It's just me here.
I'm it.
It is very hard for you.
Did...
Did you ever consider his going in there for good?
No.
I'm keeping him right here.
Well, that's very good and noble of you.
Oh, you think so?
Well, noble is not what I'm thinking about.
No, but it isn't easy.
No, it isn't, but I don't have a choice.
If I pay to put him in there, I won't hold on to the house, and the house is the only thing we own outright.
And it means a lot to me, this house does.
It's very nice.
Well, I guess it's all right.
I've done a lot on it, fixing it up, keeping it up.
Yes, I can see that you have... you do.
- I don't want to lose it.
- No.
- I'm not going to lose it.
- I see your point.
See, the company left us high and dry.
In the end, they said he owed them money.
What do I think?
Well, he was pretty stupid.
But I'm not supposed to ask, so I shut up.
You've been married, huh?
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.
And then, in the middle of all this, he gets sick from this virus, and he goes into a coma.
So that pretty much takes him off the hook, hmm?
It's bad luck.
It's, no, just life.
Can't beat life.
No.
Oh.
Hello.
Perhaps you'd like me to read to you.
I don't have any books.
Oh, there are some.
Letters from Iceland.
"Isn't it true, however far we've wandered
"into our provinces of persecution,
"where our regrets accuse, we keep returning
"back to the common faith
"from which we've all dissented,
"back to the hands, the feet, the faces?
"Children are always there and take the hands,
"even when they are most terrified.
"Those in love cannot make up their minds to go or stay.
"Artist and doctor return most often.
"Only the mad will never, never come back.
"For doctors keep on worrying while away,
"in case their skill is suffering and deserted.
"Lovers have lived so long with giants and elves,
"they want belief again in their own size.
"And the artist prays ever so gently,
"'Let me find pure all that can happen.
"'Only uniqueness is success.
"'For instance, let me perceive the images of history.
"'All that I push away with doubt and travel, today's and yesterday's alike, like bodies."'
To all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces now in the Middle East, the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you.
How could they forget Vietnam?
The air strike started again at 5 A. M. this morning and lasted for three hours.
Roadside explosions have killed eight Iraqi civilians and one U.S. soldier.
Here you go.
Next time you do it, just go pick it up, okay?
Her muscles are deteriorating.
If she doesn't improve soon, we're going to have to put her on a walker.
I keep trying to get her walking, but she doesn't seem to want to go anywhere.
But, you know, once they get on a walker, they start to depend on it, and then they don't want to walk much anymore, just get wherever it is they have to go.
You're going to have to work at her harder.
Try and encourage her.
Sorry.
Here you go.
Mrs. Andersson.
How would you like to go on a field trip?
They've kept it so like it was.
Who has?
The people who live here.
But everything...
Everything just reminds me of him.
It wasn't enough, I suppose.
Who, Fiona?
Who does everything remind you of?
I'd like to go home now, if you don't mind.
Now, as you know, we don't do extended care on the first floor.
I mean, we do it temporarily if someone isn't feeling well.
But if they progress too far, we have to consider moving upstairs.
Do you happen to have Aubrey's address?
I'm sorry?
Aubrey and his wife.
Where do they live?
Well, it was probably a mistake putting him there in the first place, but I wasn't going to get another chance to get away, so I took it.
Well, so...
Now I know better.
Did your husband ever work in a hardware store in the summers when he was going to school?
No, I never heard about that.
But I wasn't raised here.
No.
I didn't think so.
Thank you very much for your time, Miriam.
It's Marian.
Sorry.
What a jerk.
Yeah, maybe someone could just drop in on her, like, if the nurse is around.
All right.
No, I don't think there's much to it, but I'd like you to call me back.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I think I want to ask you about the second floor, just to know a little more about it.
Well, it's for people who've really lost it.
What do they do, then?
What happens after that?
After they've...
lost it?
You don't really want to know.
But, you know, sometimes they get it back.
They go into their room for a year, they don't know you from Adam, and then one day, it's, "Oh, hi.
When are we going home?"
I mean, all of a sudden, they're back to normal.
But it doesn't last for long.
You think, "Oh, wow, back to normal,"
and then they're gone again, like so.
I haven't even asked you about yourself.
You married?
Well, technically, yeah, I guess.
Got three kids.
Their dad lives in Alberta, I think.
He's making it rich, maybe.
I wouldn't know.
Must be quite a struggle.
It, uh... knocks the wind out of you every now and then, but you just pick yourself back up like everyone else.
I suppose our lives must seem easy to you.
We got through life without too much going wrong.
What we have to suffer now, when we're old, hardly counts, I suppose.
That's what you must think.
Well, how would you know what I think?
To tell you the truth, I'd rather be the one that stayed than the one that left.
I'll bet you weren't always the doggedly devoted husband.
Am I right?
I mean, you said that you wondered if maybe she was punishing you for something?
I'll bet you had something pretty specific in mind, didn't you?
You know, you see a lot of things in this job.
You see the end of things all day long.
And in my experience, at the end of things it's almost always the men that think that not too much went wrong.
I wonder if your wife feels the same way.
I wonder that, too.
I bet you do.
Uh, hello, Grant.
I hope I got the right person.
I just thought of something.
There is a dance here in town at the Legion on Saturday night, and I am on the supper committee, which means I can bring a free guest.
So I wondered whether you would happen to be interested in that.
Call me back when you get a chance.
555-3457.
I just realized I'd forgotten to say who it was.
Well, you probably recognize the voice, the accent.
It's Marian.
I'm still not so used to these machines, and I wanted to say I realize you're not single and I don't mean it that way.
I'm not, either.
But it doesn't hurt to get out once in a while.
Anyway, now I've said all this,
I really hope it's you I'm talking to.
It did sound like your voice.
If you're interested, you can call me.
And if you are not, you don't need to bother.
I just thought you might like the chance to get out.
It's Marian speaking.
I guess I already said that.
Okay, then.
Good-bye.
"The desires of the heart
"are as crooked as corkscrews.
"Not to be born is the best for man.
"The second-best is a formal order.
The dance's pattern:
dance while you can."
Fiona?
Is there any way to let this go... do you think?
If I let it go, it'll only hit me harder when I bump into it again.
Okay.
"Dance, dance, for the figure is easy.
The tune is catchy and will not stop."
"Dance till the stars
"come down from the rafters.
Dance, dance, dance till you drop."
Yes?
Hello, Marian.
So...
There you are.
Here I am.
Thank you.
What are you thinking?
Not an awful lot, really.
Skiing.
Downhill?
Cross-country.
I'm more a thrill-seeker, I guess.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking you never know how things are going to turn out.
You almost know... but you can never be quite sure.
Mr. Andersson?
Mr. Andersson?
Now, as you know, we're, uh, we're going to have to think about moving
Mrs. Andersson upstairs fairly soon, I'm afraid.
She hasn't been out of that bed for two weeks now, and...
I'm quite aware of your policies.
I'm more than aware of your bloody policies.
Well, once again, Nurse Kristy is taking me back to the second floor.
The area to my right are the elevators, and as we go on down the hall, there's a man with a broken heart, broken in a thousand pieces.
Well, we'll go to Madeleine's office, past the lunchroom.
Hopefully, they're serving right now.
The cannelloni was cold yesterday, but let's see what it's doing today.
Let's have...
I gotta have some Cokes again.
That's what I'm going to do.
Wouldn't it be better if... when we go out again, to put Aubrey back into Meadowlake?
Just for a day?
What do you think?
I'm thinking that sometimes you... just have to make the decision to be happy.
Just decide.
Things aren't ever what you hoped they'd be.
Not ever, for anybody.
The only thing that separates one kind of person from another is there are some who stay angry about it and there are some who...
accept what comes their way.
And which kind of person are you?
I was pretty mad about it.
But now... looking at what came my way...
I think I could be the other kind of person.
Quite the philosopher, huh?
Look, why don't you pull over here?
Just... pull over, could you?
I know what you're doing.
It would be easier for me if you could pretend a little.
Do you think you could do that?
Now, what were we talking about?
She was the only one in her family who bothered to learn sign language.
Now she can't remember how, or maybe even who she is.
Her daughter?
Yeah.
It's left her pretty stranded.
Marooned.
You know, I thought of you the other day.
You know that billboard out in front of the United Church in Bradford, they post all that biblical-type stuff?
The other day, it said,
"It's never too late to become what you might have been."
Doesn't sound all that biblical.
Well, maybe they're getting creative on us.
See you soon, Aubrey.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Would you mind if I had a moment alone before you come in?
To explain things to her?
I found this beautiful book about Iceland.
You wouldn't think they'd leave valuable books lying around.
People who stay here aren't all necessarily honest.
And I think they got the clothes mixed up.
I never wear yellow.
I seem to remember you reading this to me.
You were trying to make me feel better.
You tried so hard.
You're a lovely man, you know?
I'm a very lucky woman.
- Fiona?
- You've been gone a long time.
Are we all checked out?
I have a surprise for you.
Do you remember Aubrey?
Names elude me.
I'm happy to see you.
You could've just driven away.
Just driven away without a care in the world and forsook me.
Forsooken me.
Forsaken.
Not a chance.
She said,
"Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
Careful.
When did we last wash that sweater?
Right after the war.
Christmas.
In the '50s sometime or the '60s.
Shut up.
I'll go make the fire.
"You climbed the bank and said,
"'This is how you touch other women,
"the grass cutter's wife, the lime burner's daughter.
"And you searched your arms for the missing perfume and knew..."
Don't worry, darling.
I expect I'm just losing my mind.
"What good is it to be the lime burner's daughter,
"left with no trace
"as if not spoken to in the act of love,
"as if wounded without the pleasure of a scar.
"You touched your belly to my hands in the dry air
"and said, 'I am the cinnamon peeler's wife.
Smell me."'
When I look away, I forget what yellow means.
But I can look again.
Sometimes there's something delicious in oblivion.
I think you're supposed to be able to put your fingers inside the curled petal and feel the heat.
Well?
I can't be sure.
I can't be sure if what I can feel is the heat or my imagination.
The heat attracts the bugs.
Nature never fools around just being decorative.
Yes?
I don't quite know how to introduce myself.
I used to see your husband at Meadowlake.
I'm a regular visitor there myself.
Those are lovely flowers.
I've never seen those purple ones before.
The earth there must really appeal to them.
What?
You could just open the drawers.
Remind yourself.
What?
Maybe all the labels and lists are defeating the purpose.
If you stopped thinking about things the moment you write them down, maybe that's the end of your need to recall.
I heard a story at a dinner party about the German soldiers on border patrol in Czechoslovakia during the war.
I heard it from that Czech student of yours.
Veronica.
We spoke once at a dinner party.
Don't be nervous.
It's a good story.
She told me that each of the German patrol dogs wore a sign saying "hund."
"Why?" said the Czechs.
And the Germans replied, "Because that is a hund."
It was one of those craft shows where you look around and wonder that the laws of supply and demand can allow for the production of so many macramé ducks.
Oh, God, those things are everywhere.
- What do you do with them?
- Come on, Phoebe, you've got one of those.
You use it as a... what do you call it... a light fixture holder or som...
- I do not.
- Phoebe, in the...
Oh, yes.
Wait a second, I do.
Fiona gave it to me.
Yes, I did.
Would anybody like some more?
Ween...
Wai...
Wain...
No, but I'll have a touch of wine.
Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.
Some more wain.
The thing is... half the time I wander around looking for something which I know is very pertinent.
I can't remember what it is.
Once the idea is gone, everything is gone.
I just wander around trying to figure out what it was that was so important earlier.
I think I may be beginning to disappear.
And what year is it?
2003.
Fiona, if you found a letter on the street, addressed, with a stamp on it, what would you do with it?
I'd mail it.
And where would you put it to mail it?
And if there was a fire in a movie theater, and you were the first person to spot that fire, what would you do?
Well, we don't go to the movies much anymore, do we, Grant?
All those multiplexes showing the same American garbage.
Have you seen my coat?
There it is, dear.
It's on your chair.
Oh, yes.
Fiona, would you mind if I asked you a few more questions?
Would you mind taking a seat?
I was just feeling a little cold, that's all.
What an ugly baby.
When did we move into this cottage?
Was it last year or the year before?
No.
It was longer than that.
It was when I left the university, 20 years ago.
Well, that's shocking.
Let's just see how it goes, shall we?
How is your husband doing?
Okay.
He and my wife struck up quite a close friendship.
I heard about that.
So, uh,
I'd like to speak to you about something.
If you have a minute.
My husband did not try to start anything with your wife, if that's what you're getting at.
He did not try to molest her.
He's incapable of it.
And anyway, he wouldn't.
From what I hear, it was the other way around.
No, uh, that isn't it at all.
I didn't come here with any complaints.
Oh.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.
Maybe you should come in.
It's not as warm a day as it looks.
"Never let a person make you feel guilty for your anger with God."
Hmm.
Random.
I can't even see what the point is.
We can't be certain this is what...
You're far too young.
"Should the patient afflicted with the disease
"remain at home... the caregiver will very often be the spouse."
"The caregiver must preside over the degeneration
"of someone he or she loves very much,
"must do this for years and years
"with the news always getting worse, not better,
"must put up sometimes with deranged
"but at the same time very personal insults,
"and must somehow learn to smile through it all.
"Caregivers must be able to diagnose
"a wide variety of ordinary ailments
"under extraordinary circumstances.
"Imagine the person you love the most
"suddenly upset about something,
"but completely unable to communicate the problem or even to understand it himself."
Sounds like a regular marriage.
Hello, there!
Oh!
Hello, there.
We are at that stage, Grant.
We are at that stage.
Well... if we do think of it... if we do... then it must be as something that isn't permanent.
A kind of experimental treatment or... a rest cure of sorts.
All right.
All right.
We can think of it that way.
We have to sit in the kitchen, where I can hear Aubrey.
Well, you might as well have a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
My son put him on the Sports Channel a year ago Christmas.
I don't know what we'd do without it.
Must be a struggle.
Well, you know.
You know what struggle is by now.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
You don't want to just get a sense of the place?
I don't want to make this decision alone.
What place?
Just kidding!
Fuck off.
You're not making this decision alone, Grant.
I've already made up my mind.
Okay.
It's time to go home now.
- No, no.
- Mrs. Taylor...
- Hi.
Is this your son?
- Yeah.
I'm her son.
Hi.
I'm Betty.
It's time for your bath.
- Bath.
- Yeah.
You have to have a bath now.
Mama.
Mr. Andersson?
Madeleine Montpelier.
- I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.
- Hi, there.
I'm just going to take you on the quick tour of the facility, and then we can sit down and discuss Mrs. Andersson's condition and the appropriate time for admitting her.
As you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Yes, I can see that.
This is my favorite room.
Look, over there, as you can see, they have a puzzle on the go.
They always have a puzzle on the go.
- This works.
- You know, it's real important to us here that our residents maintain social function, so a lot of our activities and our whole layout is really geared toward...
Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.
Hello, Michael.
Now, as you can see, we're coming into our common room, and again, we're really emphasizing everybody being social.
So you can bring the family.
Everybody can come and visit.
We have a state-of-the-art entertainment system so the residents can gather and watch together.
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, Madeleine.
- I got a Christmas sweater.
Aren't you festive!
And this is our quiet corner for crafts and reading and reflection.
We have a lot of activities for physical activity.
Balloon badminton and sit and fit.
And here we have our lovely new dining room.
We can accommodate any dietary preferences or restrictions.
We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner early for the families.
The old Meadowlake is just next door, and that's a day center now, but, um... this for the permanent residents.
This is brand-spanking new.
So let's go upstairs, shall we?
Just taking my tea for a ride.
Oh, look at this one, Flo.
He's a real charmer, isn't he?
Would you say, are you a charmer?
I think you could say I was kind of a charmer.
You're a rascal.
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.
I should have known it.
At this age, it's...
What do the kids call it, Flo?
It's...
It's a real clusterfuck.
All the charmers are taken.
Or dead.
Mostly dead.
You're kind of charming yourself, sweetheart.
Shall we?
This is our second floor, the extended care wing.
The elevators, of course, have the lockdown system, and this is where the patients can move to once they become more progressed.
Interesting choice of words.
Why don't I show you some of the rooms here, while we're at it?
Then we can go back down and see the regular rooms where Mrs. Andersson will be living.
No, that will not be necessary.
My wife will not be progressing to this floor.
All right.
Who chooses the music?
I'm sorry?
I'm assuming it's not the residents.
I don't see any of them singing along.
Yeah, well.
You know the rooms on the regular floors all have their own stereo systems so the patients can listen to whatever they like.
How kind.
Now, we don't admit anyone during the month of December, so Mrs. Andersson will have to wait till January to make the big move.
Just December, Christmas, you know, too many emotional pitfalls.
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.
I'm looking for those documents on Aubrey Burke.
Sure.
Go ahead.
Mr. Andersson, this is Kristy, our new managing nurse.
Against some people's better judgment.
Now, now.
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Mrs. Andersson, who will be joining us in January.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
We also have a policy, which I'm sure you saw in the brochure, that our new residents are not allowed visitors or receiving phone calls during the first 30 days, just to give them a chance to settle in.
What sort of visitors?
Everyone.
Even close relatives.
I couldn't just leave her here.
We understand, it is very difficult to leave a loved one in a new environment for so long, but most people need that time to settle in.
Before we had this rule in place, residents would forget again and again why they were being left here.
Whereas we find, you give them the month to settle in, and they're happy as clams.
And after that, a little visit home every now and then, perfectly fine.
We'll take good care of her, I promise.
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, no!
Not again.
Knock-knock.
Boo.
- She's bringing two babies.
- Two babies?
She's got a new baby, four months old.
Smells good.
I was going to go for a ski, but I thought I shouldn't chance it, what with the Alzheimer's and all.
Why didn't you wake me?
What are these, Grant?
Those are the documents you're supposed to sign if you decide to go to Meadowlake.
That is exactly what I have decided.
You were to go and sign these and leave them there.
I wouldn't be allowed to visit you for 30 days.
30 days isn't such a long time after 44 years.
I don't think I like the place.
I don't think we should be looking for something we like, Grant.
I don't think we'll ever find that.
I think all we can aspire to in this situation is a little bit of grace.
I suppose I'll be dressed up all the time.
It will be sort of like... in a hotel.
How do I look?
Just like always.
Just as you've always looked.
And how does that look?
Direct and vague... sweet and ironic.
Is that how I look?
Oh.
Remember?
Surprised, Grant?
No, I'm not surprised.
I'm just grateful you can remember that.
I'm not all gone, Grant.
Just... going...
There are things I wish would go away.
But won't.
You know.
Things we don't talk about.
You never left me.
You still made love to me, despite disturbing demands elsewhere.
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.
What could you do but be a part of the time you were a part of?
All those pretty girls.
Didn't seem like anyone was willing to be left out.
I think you did all right, compared to some of your colleagues.
Those who left their wives.
And the women who wouldn't put up with it.
I think people are too demanding.
People want to be in love every single day.
What a liability.
And then that silly girl.
That silly girl Veronica.
Girls that age are always going around saying they're going to kill themselves.
But that was that.
Promised me a new life.
We moved out here, that is exactly what you gave me.
How long ago was that?
20 years.
God, that's shocking.
So you see, I'm going... but I'm not gone.
- Fiona.
- Grant.
Don't go.
That's what is happening, Grant.
It's happening... right now.
Fiona.
Hello.
I'm checking in today.
My name is Fiona Andersson.
Yes, Mrs. Andersson.
We have your room all ready for you.
- Perfect.
- We'll have our supervisor,
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.
I'll go fetch her.
She's expecting you.
Thank you.
Fiona.
Grant.
I can't go away from you like this.
We had nothing to tie us down, Grant.
You could have just driven away and forsaken me.
But you didn't.
I thank you for that.
- Mrs. Andersson.
- Oh, hello.
- How do you do?
I'm Madeleine.
- Hello.
Should I give you two a moment?
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.
All right, then, well, we'll get you settled in your room, and then I'd like to give you a tour of the facility.
- That'd be lovely.
Thank you.
- Right this way.
So, as you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Here we go.
Yes.
This'll do just fine.
Good.
I'm so glad you like it.
Now, is... is this all you brought with you today?
- For now.
- We'll see how it goes.
Well, if you need any help arranging things, you just let me know.
Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.
Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say good-bye to my husband.
We haven't been apart for a month for the last 44 years.
It could be quite something.
Okay.
Please, Fiona.
Grant.
Fiona...
You know what I'd like?
I'd like to make love, and then I'd like you to go.
Because I need to stay here, and if you make it hard for me,
I might cry so hard I'll never stop.
Go now.
Go now.
"All of the officers
"were from outside the local area,
"and it probably had not entered their minds
"that almost all of us were named McDonald.
"Nobody moved except for the shuffling of feet.
The red roo"...
Hey.
- Hello, there.
- Kristy.
We met on your tour.
How's Mrs. Andersson?
Has she settled in?
I'm wondering if I could have a moment of your time to ask your advice?
Oh, sure.
I was just reading to Mr. Burke here.
Maybe when we finish this chapter,
I can come find you in the dining room?
Sure.
That's fine.
"The red roof lights revolved in the afternoon sun, and even the dogs were temporarily quiet."
Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.
Now, how can I help you?
Going down the center of the dining room...
That's Frank.
He used to be the play-by-play guy for the Winnipeg Jets.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He loved his job too much to retire.
Frank's on the second floor.
I just...
My wife has always been sort of a different sort of person.
I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be confirmed until after...
And on our way here today, we passed this conservation area where we went for a walk last spring.
And there were these gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.
Oh, those are beautiful, aren't they?
Yes, they really made an impression, see?
And even though the whole place was covered in snow, she said, "Oh, remember?"
Now, that was...
that was... quite recently.
And isn't the short-term memory the thing that goes first?
Well, yeah, but not all at once.
And what's comforting is the long-term memory sometimes stays for quite a long time.
Yeah, her long-term memory seems quite intact.
But when she mentioned that, about the skunk lilies, it was all I could do not to turn the truck around.
What if this is just her just being herself?
She's far too young to...
She is young.
And it is hard.
No doubt about that.
A month is a real long time.
I mean, between you and me, I don't know about the policy myself.
I think it makes it easier for the staff is what I think.
Look.
I'll give you my pager number.
You can call me whenever you want.
You can call me every day if you feel like it.
I don't know what to do.
Mr. Andersson, your wife wrote you this note, and she asked me to pass it along.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Throughout much of the thinking brain, gooey plaques now crowd neurons from outside the cell membranes."
"And knotty tangles mangle microtubal transports from inside the cells."
"All told, tens of millions of synapses dissolve away."
"Because the structures and substructures of the brain
"are so highly specialized,
"the precise location of the neuronal loss determines what specific abilities will become impaired."
"It is like a series of circuit breakers in a large house, flipping off one by one."
That's a great-Iooking coffee maker.
I always meant to get one of those.
I saw they had them on sale at Canadian Tire.
They gave it to us, my son and his wife.
They live in Kamloops, B.C.
They send us more stuff than we can handle.
Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money to come see us instead.
I suppose they're busy with their own lives.
Not so busy they couldn't go to Hawaii last year.
I mean, you could understand it if there was someone in the family closer at hand, but, uh... he's the only one.
People do get lonely, especially when they're deprived of seeing someone they care about.
Fiona, for instance.
My wife.
I thought you said you went and visited her.
I do.
No, that's not it.
She's really settling in well.
Good.
Good.
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow, Mr. Andersson.
Right.
So I'll see you tomorrow morning, then.
Now, remember, she may be a little surprised to see you.
Don't be shaken by that.
Just...
She hasn't seen you in a while.
She's sort of settled in here.
I understand.
There you are.
I'll walk you down to her.
Wow.
Narcissus this early.
You must have spent a fortune.
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Andersson.
It's great to see you.
I'm gonna help you find your sweater, Mrs. Albright.
All right.
Here we are.
There is her room, right over there.
You remember from last time you were here, don't you?
Her nameplate's right on the door.
I'll leave you to it.
There she is.
Now you just go over and say hello, and try not to startle her...
Remember, she may not...
Well, just go ahead.
Bridge.
Deadly serious.
Quite rabid about it.
I can remember being like that at college for a while.
My friends and I would cut class and sit in the common room and smoke and play like cutthroats.
One's name was Phoebe.
I don't remember the others.
Phoebe Hart.
Oh, you knew her, too.
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?
I'm afraid the coffee's not up to much here.
I don't drink tea.
Oh.
I brought you some flowers.
I thought they might do to brighten up your room.
I went to your room, but you weren't there.
Well, no, I'm here.
So you've made a new friend.
Oh, that's just Aubrey.
The funny thing is I knew him years and years ago.
He used to work in the store, the hardware store where my grandpa used to shop.
He and I were always kidding around, but he never could get up the nerve to ask me out.
Until the very last weekend, he took me to a ball game.
But my grandpa showed up to drive us home.
I was up visiting for the summer.
Visiting my grandparents.
They lived in a cottage on a lake.
Fiona, I know where your grandparents lived.
It's where we lived.
We live.
Really?
I'd better go back.
He thinks he can't play without me sitting there.
It's silly.
I hardly know the game anymore.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Will you be through soon?
We should be.
I mean, it depends.
If you asked that grim-Iooking lady over there nicely, she'll get you a cup of tea.
- No, I'm fine.
- I can leave you, then?
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.
But you'll be surprised how soon you get used to it.
You'll get to know who everybody is, except that some of them are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?
Can't expect them all to get to know who you are.
Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.
What do you think?
Do you think I'd look good with red hair?
You caught her at sort of a bad moment, involved in a game.
She isn't even playing.
Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.
Now, who is Aubrey?
That's who he is, Aubrey.
You know, they get these attachments.
That kind of takes over for a while.
Best buddy kind of thing.
Sort of a phase.
Does she even know who I am?
No, she might not.
Not today, and then, tomorrow you never know.
Things change back and forth all the time.
You'll see the way it is once you get used to coming here.
You'll learn not to take it so personal.
Learn to take it day by day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll have to go and fix that now.
Here's Yung Menenikenaha, desperately clinging to his one-stroke lead.
Here's the swing.
It doesn't look good.
Looks like he's pushed it out to the right.
It lands 25 feet from the green.
This must be disappointing.
It doesn't look good for Yung Menenikenaha.
He was three strokes on the happy side of par until these last three holes.
Look at you, Mr. Andersson.
I think you might be one of our most frequent visitors.
Hi, Fiona.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
I brought you some books.
They don't seem to have an awful lot around here.
Letters from Iceland by Auden.
We always meant to read that together, didn't we?
Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?
Well, I don't know.
Um, Aubrey's card game starts in a few minutes, and then we usually go walking, and then he does his drawing...
Or perhaps you can find a bit of time later on.
Um, I'll stay here.
Or I'll come back in a few hours.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
Up comes Kapanen...
Boy, oh, boy!
Here we are at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.
It's sudden-death overtime.
They're tied 2-2.
Here are the Leafs again, led by Andreychuk.
He carries it over the blue line, winds up a shot right on!
The bounce, the rebound comes back behind the net.
McCabe couldn't get to it.
It goes back on the left wing and here come the Flyers led by Roenick again.
Roenick and Mitchell, what a twosome this two has been.
A shot right on!
Oh, it just went wide.
- Go for it, Frank.
- Over to the right side.
Here we go again.
The Leafs again.
Here's Sundin carrying it up over the line.
Can't get a shot away and it's cleared away by Philadelphia.
A loose puck grabbed by Philadelphia over on the left wing...
I just came down to say Aubrey is having his nap if you'd like to, um, talk.
Oh, sure.
Can we go somewhere a little more private?
...the side with Mitchell.
He shoots, he scores!
If...
If you'd like.
And Philly wins this series by a score of 3-2.
That's it this season for the Leafs.
Look at Phil Hitchcock.
Is he a happy coach.
Philadelphia wins 3-2.
The game is over in sudden-death overtime.
Y-You said you had some books for me?
This.
Letters from Iceland.
Yes, yes.
You said by Auden.
Yes.
That's right.
Now... where is Iceland?
Well, Iceland is in the middle of the Atlantic.
It's an island.
Youngest country in the world.
It's constantly erupting.
Volcanoes, earthquakes.
It's always shaking itself off.
Wouldn't it be nice to come from a young country?
You do.
That's where you're from.
That's where your people are from.
They immigrated here in the late 1800s.
But that's where you're from, Fiona.
And I teach...
Well, I taught the myths from there.
Norse mythology.
l-I must have been there, then.
Have I been there?
No.
Oh.
Why not?
Wasn't I curious?
You were very curious.
Very curious.
You always said there ought to be one place that you knew about and you thought about and maybe even longed for, but you did never did get to see.
Did I say that?
Yes, you said that.
Well, I'd better go and see to Aubrey.
He'll be wanting a little walk around, I suppose.
It was nice chatting.
You'll be back again tomorrow, I suppose?
Fiona, what are you doing...
What are you doing with Aubrey?
He doesn't confuse me.
He doesn't confuse me at all.
Well, it's been nice chatting.
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
These affections between residents, do they ever go too far?
Well, that depends on what you mean.
The problem we have here, it's funny.
It's actually often the ones who haven't been friendly with each other at all.
I mean, they maybe don't even know each other beyond knowing, like, is it a man or is it a woman?
And you'd think it'd be the old guys trying to crawl in bed with the old ladies, but half the time it's the other way around.
It's the old ladies going after the old men.
It could be they aren't so worn out.
Now don't get me wrong.
I don't mean Fiona.
Fiona is a lady.
She's a real lady.
I sometimes wonder...
You wonder what?
I wonder if she isn't putting on some kind of... charade.
A what?
Some kind of act.
Maybe some kind of punishment.
Why would she do that?
Oh.
Are you getting tired?
- No.
- Are you certain...
Excuse me.
Yes, Mr. Andersson?
How can I help you?
Fiona's wearing someone else's sweater.
Well, it's pretty, isn't it?
No, it's not pretty.
It's tacky.
- She would never wear it.
- Well, I'll tell you what.
You can talk to the duty attendant on Mrs. Andersson's wing.
Boy, it's a marvel, really, the way she's getting him up and out of that chair.
Can you manage?
Will you be all right?
I'll be back in a second.
Fiona, I'm your husband.
Fiona, it's Grant.
We've been married for 45 years.
Look at me, Fiona.
That is not your sweater.
We had a good life together.
Those are your words, Fiona, not mine.
That is not your sweater.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm coming straight back.
I'm coming straight back.
It's going to be all right.
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
Please... don't.
Please, please don't.
You're very persistent, aren't you?
I wish I...
Wish I knew what...
We'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
You're not doing too well, are you?
Well, no big surprise.
What we're handling isn't so easy.
I thought when I married,
I'd be with someone to the final stretch.
I'm betting you thought the same.
Well, didn't work out.
So, I, uh, think you're here for a reason.
I'm the kind of person you can say things flat out to, so shoot.
I wonder if you would consider taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake, maybe just for a visit.
Or I suppose I could take Aubrey out there myself.
I wouldn't mind that at all.
Homemade.
Really?
No.
No, I can't do that.
And the reason is I don't want to upset him.
But wouldn't he understand it was just a visit?
He understands everything.
Now, if I go to all that trouble,
I'd prefer to take him someplace that'd be more fun?
It would make more sense to take him to the mall where there are kids and whatnot.
And then I'd have to get him all ready, maneuver him into the car.
He's a big man.
He's not that easy to manage.
Even if I agreed to do it?
You couldn't do it.
You don't know him.
You couldn't manage him.
And he wouldn't stand your doing for him.
And after all that, what would he get out of it?
Smoke?
No.
No, thanks.
What, did you never, or did you quit?
I quit.
How long ago?
Oh, 30 years, maybe more.
I quit quitting.
Just made a resolution to quit quitting, that's all.
So your wife's depressed, huh?
What's her name again?
I forget.
Fiona.
And how old were you when you met?
She was 18.
Holy, that's pretty young to get married, eh?
Wasn't my idea.
You mean she proposed to you?
Well, that's lovely, that's what I think.
How'd she do it?
She hadn't planned it necessarily.
We were in Tobermory waiting for the ferry to Manitoulin, and it was miserable and rainy, and she was in a good mood.
She didn't want any part of my sour mood.
And what'd she do, what'd she say?
Well, she said, "Do you think it'd be fun...
Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I shouted yes.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
You know, nothing can take away what's happened to you and what you've experienced.
I don't think so, anyway.
Even if it goes away somehow, it's still there.
It's still what you are.
It's curious.
What's curious?
All of that "madly in love" business.
The beginning.
I hear myself tell the story, and it all sounds so crucial.
I suppose it is.
But compared to what we ended up with, until recently... all of that seems so superficial somehow.
Not such a fun place to visit, eh?
Excuse me?
Not such a fun place to visit.
Fucking depressing.
No offense.
None taken.
No one came to visit you, huh?
That must suck huge.
Well, it would suck huge, but I don't live here.
I'm just visiting someone.
Who?
Which one?
Beautiful woman with the shock of hair.
The one sitting with her husband?
- You might say that.
- Why wouldn't you?
I wouldn't say that because I'm her husband.
So why aren't you sitting with her, then?
Just learned to give her some space.
She's in love with that man she's sitting with.
I don't like to disturb her.
I just like to see her, I suppose.
Make sure she's doing well, you know?
I suppose that must seem rather pathetic.
I should be so lucky.
Come on.
She's not here.
She's sick.
He's not here, either.
I brought you a book.
It's all about Iceland.
Thought you might like to take a look at it.
Why, thank you.
Oh, what is it, dear heart?
What is it?
Oh, I see.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here, here, yes.
Do you by any chance have any influence around here?
I've seen you talking to them.
Oh.
We'll get to see each other.
You'll see.
We have to.
I'll come and see you, and you'll come and see me.
You know, I just wish his wife would hurry up and get here.
I wish she'd get him out of here and cut the agony short.
Should I stay?
Don't worry.
She's not sick, you know.
To keep her company.
Well, they have to learn to get over these things by themselves.
They've got short memories, and that's not always so bad.
Okay?
Fiona.
Her name is Fiona.
And what's yours?
I don't think I was ever told that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's Grant.
Hello, Grant.
I'm Marian.
Well, now that we know each other's name,
I can tell you straight out what I'm thinking.
I don't know if he's still so stuck on seeing your... seeing Fiona.
I don't ask him, he doesn't tell me.
But I don't feel like putting him back in there in case it turns out to be more than that.
I don't want him getting hard to handle.
I don't have any help.
It's just me here.
I'm it.
It is very hard for you.
Did...
Did you ever consider his going in there for good?
No.
I'm keeping him right here.
Well, that's very good and noble of you.
Oh, you think so?
Well, noble is not what I'm thinking about.
No, but it isn't easy.
No, it isn't, but I don't have a choice.
If I pay to put him in there, I won't hold on to the house, and the house is the only thing we own outright.
And it means a lot to me, this house does.
It's very nice.
Well, I guess it's all right.
I've done a lot on it, fixing it up, keeping it up.
Yes, I can see that you have... you do.
- I don't want to lose it.
- No.
- I'm not going to lose it.
- I see your point.
See, the company left us high and dry.
In the end, they said he owed them money.
What do I think?
Well, he was pretty stupid.
But I'm not supposed to ask, so I shut up.
You've been married, huh?
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.
And then, in the middle of all this, he gets sick from this virus, and he goes into a coma.
So that pretty much takes him off the hook, hmm?
It's bad luck.
It's, no, just life.
Can't beat life.
No.
Oh.
Hello.
Perhaps you'd like me to read to you.
I don't have any books.
Oh, there are some.
Letters from Iceland.
"Isn't it true, however far we've wandered
"into our provinces of persecution,
"where our regrets accuse, we keep returning
"back to the common faith
"from which we've all dissented,
"back to the hands, the feet, the faces?
"Children are always there and take the hands,
"even when they are most terrified.
"Those in love cannot make up their minds to go or stay.
"Artist and doctor return most often.
"Only the mad will never, never come back.
"For doctors keep on worrying while away,
"in case their skill is suffering and deserted.
"Lovers have lived so long with giants and elves,
"they want belief again in their own size.
"And the artist prays ever so gently,
"'Let me find pure all that can happen.
"'Only uniqueness is success.
"'For instance, let me perceive the images of history.
"'AII that I push away with doubt and travel, today's and yesterday's alike, like bodies."'
To all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces now in the Middle East, the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you.
How could they forget Vietnam?
The air strike started again at 5 A. M. this morning and lasted for three hours.
Roadside explosions have killed eight Iraqi civilians and one U.S. soldier.
Here you go.
Next time you do it, just go pick it up, okay?
Her muscles are deteriorating.
If she doesn't improve soon, we're going to have to put her on a walker.
I keep trying to get her walking, but she doesn't seem to want to go anywhere.
But, you know, once they get on a walker, they start to depend on it, and then they don't want to walk much anymore, just get wherever it is they have to go.
You're going to have to work at her harder.
Try and encourage her.
Sorry.
Here you go.
Mrs. Andersson.
How would you like to go on a field trip?
They've kept it so like it was.
Who has?
The people who live here.
But everything...
Everything just reminds me of him.
It wasn't enough, I suppose.
Who, Fiona?
Who does everything remind you of?
I'd like to go home now, if you don't mind.
Now, as you know, we don't do extended care on the first floor.
I mean, we do it temporarily if someone isn't feeling well.
But if they progress too far, we have to consider moving upstairs.
Do you happen to have Aubrey's address?
I'm sorry?
Aubrey and his wife.
Where do they live?
Well, it was probably a mistake putting him there in the first place, but I wasn't going to get another chance to get away, so I took it.
Well, so...
Now I know better.
Did your husband ever work in a hardware store in the summers when he was going to school?
No, I never heard about that.
But I wasn't raised here.
No.
I didn't think so.
Thank you very much for your time, Miriam.
It's Marian.
Sorry.
What a jerk.
Yeah, maybe someone could just drop in on her, like, if the nurse is around.
All right.
No, I don't think there's much to it, but I'd like you to call me back.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I think I want to ask you about the second floor, just to know a little more about it.
Well, it's for people who've really lost it.
What do they do, then?
What happens after that?
After they've...
lost it?
You don't really want to know.
But, you know, sometimes they get it back.
They go into their room for a year, they don't know you from Adam, and then one day, it's, "Oh, hi.
When are we going home?"
I mean, all of a sudden, they're back to normal.
But it doesn't last for long.
You think, "Oh, wow, back to normal,"
and then they're gone again, like so.
I haven't even asked you about yourself.
You married?
Well, technically, yeah, I guess.
Got three kids.
Their dad lives in Alberta, I think.
He's making it rich, maybe.
I wouldn't know.
Must be quite a struggle.
It, uh... knocks the wind out of you every now and then, but you just pick yourself back up like everyone else.
I suppose our lives must seem easy to you.
We got through life without too much going wrong.
What we have to suffer now, when we're old, hardly counts, I suppose.
That's what you must think.
Well, how would you know what I think?
To tell you the truth, I'd rather be the one that stayed than the one that left.
I'll bet you weren't always the doggedly devoted husband.
Am I right?
I mean, you said that you wondered if maybe she was punishing you for something?
I'll bet you had something pretty specific in mind, didn't you?
You know, you see a lot of things in this job.
You see the end of things all day long.
And in my experience, at the end of things it's almost always the men that think that not too much went wrong.
I wonder if your wife feels the same way.
I wonder that, too.
I bet you do.
Uh, hello, Grant.
I hope I got the right person.
I just thought of something.
There is a dance here in town at the Legion on Saturday night, and I am on the supper committee, which means I can bring a free guest.
So I wondered whether you would happen to be interested in that.
Call me back when you get a chance.
555-3457.
I just realized I'd forgotten to say who it was.
Well, you probably recognize the voice, the accent.
It's Marian.
I'm still not so used to these machines, and I wanted to say I realize you're not single and I don't mean it that way.
I'm not, either.
But it doesn't hurt to get out once in a while.
Anyway, now I've said all this,
I really hope it's you I'm talking to.
It did sound like your voice.
If you're interested, you can call me.
And if you are not, you don't need to bother.
I just thought you might like the chance to get out.
It's Marian speaking.
I guess I already said that.
Okay, then.
Good-bye.
"The desires of the heart
"are as crooked as corkscrews.
"Not to be born is the best for man.
"The second-best is a formal order.
The dance's pattern:
dance while you can."
Fiona?
Is there any way to let this go... do you think?
If I let it go, it'll only hit me harder when I bump into it again.
Okay.
"Dance, dance, for the figure is easy.
The tune is catchy and will not stop."
"Dance till the stars
"come down from the rafters.
Dance, dance, dance till you drop."
Yes?
Hello, Marian.
So...
There you are.
Here I am.
Thank you.
What are you thinking?
Not an awful lot, really.
Skiing.
Downhill?
Cross-country.
I'm more a thrill-seeker, I guess.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking you never know how things are going to turn out.
You almost know... but you can never be quite sure.
Mr. Andersson?
Mr. Andersson?
Now, as you know, we're, uh, we're going to have to think about moving
Mrs. Andersson upstairs fairly soon, I'm afraid.
She hasn't been out of that bed for two weeks now, and...
I'm quite aware of your policies.
I'm more than aware of your bloody policies.
Well, once again, Nurse Kristy is taking me back to the second floor.
The area to my right are the elevators, and as we go on down the hall, there's a man with a broken heart, broken in a thousand pieces.
Well, we'll go to Madeleine's office, past the lunchroom.
Hopefully, they're serving right now.
The cannelloni was cold yesterday, but let's see what it's doing today.
Let's have...
I gotta have some Cokes again.
That's what I'm going to do.
Wouldn't it be better if... when we go out again, to put Aubrey back into Meadowlake?
Just for a day?
What do you think?
I'm thinking that sometimes you... just have to make the decision to be happy.
Just decide.
Things aren't ever what you hoped they'd be.
Not ever, for anybody.
The only thing that separates one kind of person from another is there are some who stay angry about it and there are some who...
accept what comes their way.
And which kind of person are you?
I was pretty mad about it.
But now...
looking at what came my way...
I think I could be the other kind of person.
Quite the philosopher, huh?
Look, why don't you pull over here?
Just... pull over, could you?
I know what you're doing.
It would be easier for me if you could pretend a little.
Do you think you could do that?
Now, what were we talking about?
She was the only one in her family who bothered to learn sign language.
Now she can't remember how, or maybe even who she is.
Her daughter?
Yeah.
It's left her pretty stranded.
Marooned.
You know, I thought of you the other day.
You know that billboard out in front of the United Church in Bradford, they post all that biblical-type stuff?
The other day, it said,
"It's never too late to become what you might have been."
Doesn't sound all that biblical.
Well, maybe they're getting creative on us.
See you soon, Aubrey.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Would you mind if I had a moment alone before you come in?
To explain things to her?
I found this beautiful book about Iceland.
You wouldn't think they'd leave valuable books lying around.
People who stay here aren't all necessarily honest.
And I think they got the clothes mixed up.
I never wear yellow.
I seem to remember you reading this to me.
You were trying to make me feel better.
You tried so hard.
You're a lovely man, you know?
I'm a very lucky woman.
- Fiona?
- You've been gone a long time.
Are we all checked out?
I have a surprise for you.
Do you remember Aubrey?
Names elude me.
I'm happy to see you.
You could've just driven away.
Just driven away without a care in the world and forsook me.
Forsooken me.
Forsaken.
Not a chance.
She said,
"Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
Careful.
When did we last wash that sweater?
Right after the war.
Christmas.
In the '50s sometime or the '60s.
Shut up.
I'll go make the fire.
"You climbed the bank and said,
"'This is how you touch other women,
"the grass cutter's wife, the lime burner's daughter.
"And you searched your arms for the missing perfume and knew..."
Don't worry, darling.
I expect I'm just losing my mind.
"What good is it to be the lime burner's daughter,
"left with no trace
"as if not spoken to in the act of love,
"as if wounded without the pleasure of a scar.
"You touched your belly to my hands in the dry air
"and said, 'I am the cinnamon peeler's wife.
Smell me.'"
When I look away, I forget what yellow means.
But I can look again.
Sometimes there's something delicious in oblivion.
I think you're supposed to be able to put your fingers inside the curled petal and feel the heat.
Well?
I can't be sure.
I can't be sure if what I can feel is the heat or my imagination.
The heat attracts the bugs.
Nature never fools around just being decorative.
Yes?
I don't quite know how to introduce myself.
I used to see your husband at Meadowlake.
I'm a regular visitor there myself.
Those are lovely flowers.
I've never seen those purple ones before.
The earth there must really appeal to them.
What?
You could just open the drawers.
Remind yourself.
What?
Maybe all the labels and lists are defeating the purpose.
If you stopped thinking about things the moment you write them down, maybe that's the end of your need to recall.
I heard a story at a dinner party about the German soldiers on border patrol in Czechoslovakia during the war.
I heard it from that Czech student of yours.
Veronica.
We spoke once at a dinner party.
Don't be nervous.
It's a good story.
She told me that each of the German patrol dogs wore a sign saying "hund."
"Why?" said the Czechs.
And the Germans replied, "Because that is a hund."
It was one of those craft shows where you look around and wonder that the laws of supply and demand can allow for the production of so many macramé ducks.
Oh, God, those things are everywhere.
- What do you do with them?
- Come on, Phoebe, you've got one of those.
You use it as a... what do you call it... a light fixture holder or som...
- I do not.
- Phoebe, in the...
Oh, yes.
Wait a second, I do.
Fiona gave it to me.
Yes, I did.
Would anybody like some more?
Ween...
Wai...
Wain...
No, but I'll have a touch of wine.
Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.
Some more wain.
The thing is... half the time I wander around looking for something which I know is very pertinent.
I can't remember what it is.
Once the idea is gone, everything is gone.
I just wander around trying to figure out what it was that was so important earlier.
I think I may be beginning to disappear.
And what year is it?
2003.
Fiona, if you found a letter on the street, addressed, with a stamp on it, what would you do with it?
I'd mail it.
And where would you put it to mail it?
And if there was a fire in a movie theater, and you were the first person to spot that fire, what would you do?
Well, we don't go to the movies much anymore, do we, Grant?
All those multiplexes showing the same American garbage.
Have you seen my coat?
There it is, dear.
It's on your chair.
Oh, yes.
Fiona, would you mind if I asked you a few more questions?
Would you mind taking a seat?
I was just feeling a little cold, that's all.
What an ugly baby.
When did we move into this cottage?
Was it last year or the year before?
No.
It was longer than that.
It was when I left the university, 20 years ago.
Well, that's shocking.
Let's just see how it goes, shall we?
How is your husband doing?
Okay.
He and my wife struck up quite a close friendship.
I heard about that.
So, uh,
I'd like to speak to you about something.
If you have a minute.
My husband did not try to start anything with your wife, if that's what you're getting at.
He did not try to molest her.
He's incapable of it.
And anyway, he wouldn't.
From what I hear, it was the other way around.
No, uh, that isn't it at all.
I didn't come here with any complaints.
Oh.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.
Maybe you should come in.
It's not as warm a day as it looks.
"Never let a person make you feel guilty for your anger with God."
Hmm.
Random.
I can't even see what the point is.
We can't be certain this is what...
You're far too young.
"Should the patient afflicted with the disease
"remain at home... the caregiver will very often be the spouse."
"The caregiver must preside over the degeneration
"of someone he or she loves very much,
"must do this for years and years
"with the news always getting worse, not better,
"must put up sometimes with deranged
"but at the same time very personal insults,
"and must somehow learn to smile through it all.
"Caregivers must be able to diagnose
"a wide variety of ordinary ailments
"under extraordinary circumstances.
"Imagine the person you love the most
"suddenly upset about something,
"but completely unable to communicate the problem or even to understand it himself."
Sounds like a regular marriage.
Hello, there!
Oh!
Hello, there.
We are at that stage, Grant.
We are at that stage.
Well... if we do think of it... if we do... then it must be as something that isn't permanent.
A kind of experimental treatment or... a rest cure of sorts.
All right.
All right.
We can think of it that way.
We have to sit in the kitchen, where I can hear Aubrey.
Well, you might as well have a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
My son put him on the Sports Channel a year ago Christmas.
I don't know what we'd do without it.
Must be a struggle.
Well, you know.
You know what struggle is by now.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
You don't want to just get a sense of the place?
I don't want to make this decision alone.
What place?
Just kidding!
Fuck off.
You're not making this decision alone, Grant.
I've already made up my mind.
Okay.
It's time to go home now.
- No, no.
- Mrs. Taylor...
- Hi.
Is this your son?
- Yeah.
I'm her son.
Hi.
I'm Betty.
It's time for your bath.
- Bath.
- Yeah.
You have to have a bath now.
Mama.
Mr. Andersson?
Madeleine Montpelier.
- I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.
- Hi, there.
I'm just going to take you on the quick tour of the facility, and then we can sit down and discuss Mrs. Andersson's condition and the appropriate time for admitting her.
As you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Yes, I can see that.
This is my favorite room.
Look, over there, as you can see, they have a puzzle on the go.
They always have a puzzle on the go.
- This works.
- You know, it's real important to us here that our residents maintain social function, so a lot of our activities and our whole layout is really geared toward...
Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.
Hello, Michael.
Now, as you can see, we're coming into our common room, and again, we're really emphasizing everybody being social.
So you can bring the family.
Everybody can come and visit.
We have a state-of-the-art entertainment system so the residents can gather and watch together.
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, Madeleine.
- I got a Christmas sweater.
Aren't you festive!
And this is our quiet corner for crafts and reading and reflection.
We have a lot of activities for physical activity.
Balloon badminton and sit and fit.
And here we have our lovely new dining room.
We can accommodate any dietary preferences or restrictions.
We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner early for the families.
The old Meadowlake is just next door, and that's a day center now, but, um... this for the permanent residents.
This is brand-spanking new.
So let's go upstairs, shall we?
Just taking my tea for a ride.
Oh, look at this one, Flo.
He's a real charmer, isn't he?
Would you say, are you a charmer?
I think you could say I was kind of a charmer.
You're a rascal.
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.
I should have known it.
At this age, it's...
What do the kids call it, Flo?
It's...
It's a real clusterfuck.
All the charmers are taken.
Or dead.
Mostly dead.
You're kind of charming yourself, sweetheart.
Shall we?
This is our second floor, the extended care wing.
The elevators, of course, have the lockdown system, and this is where the patients can move to once they become more progressed.
Interesting choice of words.
Why don't I show you some of the rooms here, while we're at it?
Then we can go back down and see the regular rooms where Mrs. Andersson will be living.
No, that will not be necessary.
My wife will not be progressing to this floor.
All right.
Who chooses the music?
I'm sorry?
I'm assuming it's not the residents.
I don't see any of them singing along.
Yeah, well.
You know the rooms on the regular floors all have their own stereo systems so the patients can listen to whatever they like.
How kind.
Now, we don't admit anyone during the month of December, so Mrs. Andersson will have to wait till January to make the big move.
Just December, Christmas, you know, too many emotional pitfalls.
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.
I'm looking for those documents on Aubrey Burke.
Sure.
Go ahead.
Mr. Andersson, this is Kristy, our new managing nurse.
Against some people's better judgment.
Now, now.
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Mrs. Andersson, who will be joining us in January.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
We also have a policy, which I'm sure you saw in the brochure, that our new residents are not allowed visitors or receiving phone calls during the first 30 days, just to give them a chance to settle in.
What sort of visitors?
Everyone.
Even close relatives.
I couldn't just leave her here.
We understand, it is very difficult to leave a loved one in a new environment for so long, but most people need that time to settle in.
Before we had this rule in place, residents would forget again and again why they were being left here.
Whereas we find, you give them the month to settle in, and they're happy as clams.
And after that, a little visit home every now and then, perfectly fine.
We'll take good care of her, I promise.
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, no!
Not again.
Knock-knock.
Boo.
- She's bringing two babies.
- Two babies?
She's got a new baby, four months old.
Smells good.
I was going to go for a ski, but I thought I shouldn't chance it, what with the Alzheimer's and all.
Why didn't you wake me?
What are these, Grant?
Those are the documents you're supposed to sign if you decide to go to Meadowlake.
That is exactly what I have decided.
You were to go and sign these and leave them there.
I wouldn't be allowed to visit you for 30 days.
30 days isn't such a long time after 44 years.
I don't think I like the place.
I don't think we should be looking for something we like, Grant.
I don't think we'll ever find that.
I think all we can aspire to in this situation is a little bit of grace.
I suppose I'll be dressed up all the time.
It will be sort of like... in a hotel.
How do I look?
Just like always.
Just as you've always looked.
And how does that look?
Direct and vague... sweet and ironic.
Is that how I look?
Oh.
Remember?
Surprised, Grant?
No, I'm not surprised.
I'm just grateful you can remember that.
I'm not all gone, Grant.
Just... going...
There are things I wish would go away.
But won't.
You know.
Things we don't talk about.
You never left me.
You still made love to me, despite disturbing demands elsewhere.
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.
What could you do but be a part of the time you were a part of?
All those pretty girls.
Didn't seem like anyone was willing to be left out.
I think you did all right, compared to some of your colleagues.
Those who left their wives.
And the women who wouldn't put up with it.
I think people are too demanding.
People want to be in love every single day.
What a liability.
And then that silly girl.
That silly girl Veronica.
Girls that age are always going around saying they're going to kill themselves.
But that was that.
Promised me a new life.
We moved out here, that is exactly what you gave me.
How long ago was that?
20 years.
God, that's shocking.
So you see, I'm going... but I'm not gone.
- Fiona.
- Grant.
Don't go.
That's what is happening, Grant.
It's happening... right now.
Fiona.
Hello.
I'm checking in today.
My name is Fiona Andersson.
Yes, Mrs. Andersson.
We have your room all ready for you.
- Perfect.
- We'll have our supervisor,
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.
I'll go fetch her.
She's expecting you.
Thank you.
Fiona.
Grant.
I can't go away from you like this.
We had nothing to tie us down, Grant.
You could have just driven away and forsaken me.
But you didn't.
I thank you for that.
- Mrs. Andersson.
- Oh, hello.
- How do you do?
I'm Madeleine.
- Hello.
Should I give you two a moment?
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.
All right, then, well, we'll get you settled in your room, and then I'd like to give you a tour of the facility.
- That'd be lovely.
Thank you.
- Right this way.
So, as you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Here we go.
Yes.
This'll do just fine.
Good.
I'm so glad you like it.
Now, is... is this all you brought with you today?
- For now.
- We'll see how it goes.
Well, if you need any help arranging things, you just let me know.
Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.
Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say good-bye to my husband.
We haven't been apart for a month for the last 44 years.
It could be quite something.
Okay.
Please, Fiona.
Grant.
Fiona...
You know what I'd like?
I'd like to make love, and then I'd like you to go.
Because I need to stay here, and if you make it hard for me,
I might cry so hard I'll never stop.
Go now.
Go now.
"All of the officers
"were from outside the local area,
"and it probably had not entered their minds
"that almost all of us were named McDonald.
"Nobody moved except for the shuffling of feet.
The red roo"...
Hey.
- Hello, there.
- Kristy.
We met on your tour.
How's Mrs. Andersson?
Has she settled in?
I'm wondering if I could have a moment of your time to ask your advice?
Oh, sure.
I was just reading to Mr. Burke here.
Maybe when we finish this chapter,
I can come find you in the dining room?
Sure.
That's fine.
"The red roof lights revolved in the afternoon sun, and even the dogs were temporarily quiet."
Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.
Now, how can I help you?
Going down the center of the dining room...
That's Frank.
He used to be the play-by-play guy for the Winnipeg Jets.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He loved his job too much to retire.
Frank's on the second floor.
I just...
My wife has always been sort of a different sort of person.
I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be confirmed until after...
And on our way here today, we passed this conservation area where we went for a walk last spring.
And there were these gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.
Oh, those are beautiful, aren't they?
Yes, they really made an impression, see?
And even though the whole place was covered in snow, she said, "Oh, remember?"
Now, that was...
that was... quite recently.
And isn't the short-term memory the thing that goes first?
Well, yeah, but not all at once.
And what's comforting is the long-term memory sometimes stays for quite a long time.
Yeah, her long-term memory seems quite intact.
But when she mentioned that, about the skunk lilies, it was all I could do not to turn the truck around.
What if this is just her just being herself?
She's far too young to...
She is young.
And it is hard.
No doubt about that.
A month is a real long time.
I mean, between you and me, I don't know about the policy myself.
I think it makes it easier for the staff is what I think.
Look.
I'll give you my pager number.
You can call me whenever you want.
You can call me every day if you feel like it.
I don't know what to do.
Mr. Andersson, your wife wrote you this note, and she asked me to pass it along.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Throughout much of the thinking brain, gooey plaques now crowd neurons from outside the cell membranes."
"And knotty tangles mangle microtubal transports from inside the cells."
"All told, tens of millions of synapses dissolve away."
"Because the structures and substructures of the brain
"are so highly specialized,
"the precise location of the neuronal loss determines what specific abilities will become impaired."
"It is like a series of circuit breakers in a large house, flipping off one by one."
That's a great-looking coffee maker.
I always meant to get one of those.
I saw they had them on sale at Canadian Tire.
They gave it to us, my son and his wife.
They live in Kamloops, B.C.
They send us more stuff than we can handle.
Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money to come see us instead.
I suppose they're busy with their own lives.
Not so busy they couldn't go to Hawaii last year.
I mean, you could understand it if there was someone in the family closer at hand, but, uh... he's the only one.
People do get lonely, especially when they're deprived of seeing someone they care about.
Fiona, for instance.
My wife.
I thought you said you went and visited her.
I do.
No, that's not it.
She's really settling in well.
Good.
Good.
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow, Mr. Andersson.
Right.
So I'll see you tomorrow morning, then.
Now, remember, she may be a little surprised to see you.
Don't be shaken by that.
Just...
She hasn't seen you in a while.
She's sort of settled in here.
I understand.
There you are.
I'll walk you down to her.
Wow.
Narcissus this early.
You must have spent a fortune.
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Andersson.
It's great to see you.
I'm gonna help you find your sweater, Mrs. Albright.
All right.
Here we are.
There is her room, right over there.
You remember from last time you were here, don't you?
Her nameplate's right on the door.
I'll leave you to it.
There she is.
Now you just go over and say hello, and try not to startle her...
Remember, she may not...
Well, just go ahead.
Bridge.
Deadly serious.
Quite rabid about it.
I can remember being like that at college for a while.
My friends and I would cut class and sit in the common room and smoke and play like cutthroats.
One's name was Phoebe.
I don't remember the others.
Phoebe Hart.
Oh, you knew her, too.
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?
I'm afraid the coffee's not up to much here.
I don't drink tea.
Oh.
I brought you some flowers.
I thought they might do to brighten up your room.
I went to your room, but you weren't there.
Well, no, I'm here.
So you've made a new friend.
Oh, that's just Aubrey.
The funny thing is I knew him years and years ago.
He used to work in the store, the hardware store where my grandpa used to shop.
He and I were always kidding around, but he never could get up the nerve to ask me out.
Until the very last weekend, he took me to a ball game.
But my grandpa showed up to drive us home.
I was up visiting for the summer.
Visiting my grandparents.
They lived in a cottage on a lake.
Fiona, I know where your grandparents lived.
It's where we lived.
We live.
Really?
I'd better go back.
He thinks he can't play without me sitting there.
It's silly.
I hardly know the game anymore.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Will you be through soon?
We should be.
I mean, it depends.
If you asked that grim-looking lady over there nicely, she'll get you a cup of tea.
- No, I'm fine.
- I can leave you, then?
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.
But you'll be surprised how soon you get used to it.
You'll get to know who everybody is, except that some of them are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?
Can't expect them all to get to know who you are.
Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.
What do you think?
Do you think I'd look good with red hair?
You caught her at sort of a bad moment, involved in a game.
She isn't even playing.
Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.
Now, who is Aubrey?
That's who he is, Aubrey.
You know, they get these attachments.
That kind of takes over for a while.
Best buddy kind of thing.
Sort of a phase.
Does she even know who I am?
No, she might not.
Not today, and then, tomorrow you never know.
Things change back and forth all the time.
You'll see the way it is once you get used to coming here.
You'll learn not to take it so personal.
Learn to take it day by day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll have to go and fix that now.
Here's Yung Menenikenaha, desperately clinging to his one-stroke lead.
Here's the swing.
It doesn't look good.
Looks like he's pushed it out to the right.
It lands 25 feet from the green.
This must be disappointing.
It doesn't look good for Yung Menenikenaha.
He was three strokes on the happy side of par until these last three holes.
Look at you, Mr. Andersson.
I think you might be one of our most frequent visitors.
Hi, Fiona.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
I brought you some books.
They don't seem to have an awful lot around here.
Letters from Iceland by Auden.
We always meant to read that together, didn't we?
Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?
Well, I don't know.
Um, Aubrey's card game starts in a few minutes, and then we usually go walking, and then he does his drawing...
Or perhaps you can find a bit of time later on.
Um, I'll stay here.
Or I'll come back in a few hours.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
Up comes Kapanen...
Boy, oh, boy!
Here we are at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.
It's sudden-death overtime.
They're tied 2-2.
Here are the Leafs again, led by Andreychuk.
He carries it over the blue line, winds up a shot right on!
The bounce, the rebound comes back behind the net.
McCabe couldn't get to it.
It goes back on the left wing and here come the Flyers led by Roenick again.
Roenick and Mitchell, what a twosome this two has been.
A shot right on!
Oh, it just went wide.
- Go for it, Frank.
- Over to the right side.
Here we go again.
The Leafs again.
Here's Sundin carrying it up over the line.
Can't get a shot away and it's cleared away by Philadelphia.
A loose puck grabbed by Philadelphia over on the left wing...
I just came down to say Aubrey is having his nap if you'd like to, um, talk.
Oh, sure.
Can we go somewhere a little more private?
...the side with Mitchell.
He shoots, he scores!
If...
If you'd like.
And Philly wins this series by a score of 3-2.
That's it this season for the Leafs.
Look at Phil Hitchcock.
Is he a happy coach.
Philadelphia wins 3-2.
The game is over in sudden-death overtime.
Y-You said you had some books for me?
This.
Letters from Iceland.
Yes, yes.
You said by Auden.
Yes.
That's right.
Now... where is Iceland?
Well, Iceland is in the middle of the Atlantic.
It's an island.
Youngest country in the world.
It's constantly erupting.
Volcanoes, earthquakes.
It's always shaking itself off.
Wouldn't it be nice to come from a young country?
You do.
That's where you're from.
That's where your people are from.
They immigrated here in the late 1800s.
But that's where you're from, Fiona.
And I teach...
Well, I taught the myths from there.
Norse mythology.
l-I must have been there, then.
Have I been there?
No.
Oh.
Why not?
Wasn't I curious?
You were very curious.
Very curious.
You always said there ought to be one place that you knew about and you thought about and maybe even longed for, but you did never did get to see.
Did I say that?
Yes, you said that.
Well, I'd better go and see to Aubrey.
He'll be wanting a little walk around, I suppose.
It was nice chatting.
You'll be back again tomorrow, I suppose?
Fiona, what are you doing...
What are you doing with Aubrey?
He doesn't confuse me.
He doesn't confuse me at all.
Well, it's been nice chatting.
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
These affections between residents, do they ever go too far?
Well, that depends on what you mean.
The problem we have here, it's funny.
It's actually often the ones who haven't been friendly with each other at all.
I mean, they maybe don't even know each other beyond knowing, like, is it a man or is it a woman?
And you'd think it'd be the old guys trying to crawl in bed with the old ladies, but half the time it's the other way around.
It's the old ladies going after the old men.
It could be they aren't so worn out.
Now don't get me wrong.
I don't mean Fiona.
Fiona is a lady.
She's a real lady.
I sometimes wonder...
You wonder what?
I wonder if she isn't putting on some kind of... charade.
A what?
Some kind of act.
Maybe some kind of punishment.
Why would she do that?
Oh.
Are you getting tired?
- No.
- Are you certain...
Excuse me.
Yes, Mr. Andersson?
How can I help you?
Fiona's wearing someone else's sweater.
Well, it's pretty, isn't it?
No, it's not pretty.
It's tacky.
- She would never wear it.
- Well, I'll tell you what.
You can talk to the duty attendant on Mrs. Andersson's wing.
Boy, it's a marvel, really, the way she's getting him up and out of that chair.
Can you manage?
Will you be all right?
I'll be back in a second.
Fiona, I'm your husband.
Fiona, it's Grant.
We've been married for 45 years.
Look at me, Fiona.
That is not your sweater.
We had a good life together.
Those are your words, Fiona, not mine.
That is not your sweater.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm coming straight back.
I'm coming straight back.
It's going to be all right.
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
Please... don't.
Please, please don't.
You're very persistent, aren't you?
I wish I...
Wish I knew what...
We'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
You're not doing too well, are you?
Well, no big surprise.
What we're handling isn't so easy.
I thought when I married,
I'd be with someone to the final stretch.
I'm betting you thought the same.
Well, didn't work out.
So, I, uh, think you're here for a reason.
I'm the kind of person you can say things flat out to, so shoot.
I wonder if you would consider taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake, maybe just for a visit.
Or I suppose I could take Aubrey out there myself.
I wouldn't mind that at all.
Homemade.
Really?
No.
No, I can't do that.
And the reason is I don't want to upset him.
But wouldn't he understand it was just a visit?
He understands everything.
Now, if I go to all that trouble,
I'd prefer to take him someplace that'd be more fun?
It would make more sense to take him to the mall where there are kids and whatnot.
And then I'd have to get him all ready, maneuver him into the car.
He's a big man.
He's not that easy to manage.
Even if I agreed to do it?
You couldn't do it.
You don't know him.
You couldn't manage him.
And he wouldn't stand your doing for him.
And after all that, what would he get out of it?
Smoke?
No.
No, thanks.
What, did you never, or did you quit?
I quit.
How long ago?
Oh, 30 years, maybe more.
I quit quitting.
Just made a resolution to quit quitting, that's all.
So your wife's depressed, huh?
What's her name again?
I forget.
Fiona.
And how old were you when you met?
She was 18.
Holy, that's pretty young to get married, eh?
Wasn't my idea.
You mean she proposed to you?
Well, that's lovely, that's what I think.
How'd she do it?
She hadn't planned it necessarily.
We were in Tobermory waiting for the ferry to Manitoulin, and it was miserable and rainy, and she was in a good mood.
She didn't want any part of my sour mood.
And what'd she do, what'd she say?
Well, she said, "Do you think it'd be fun...
Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I shouted yes.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
You know, nothing can take away what's happened to you and what you've experienced.
I don't think so, anyway.
Even if it goes away somehow, it's still there.
It's still what you are.
It's curious.
What's curious?
All of that "madly in love" business.
The beginning.
I hear myself tell the story, and it all sounds so crucial.
I suppose it is.
But compared to what we ended up with, until recently... all of that seems so superficial somehow.
Not such a fun place to visit, eh?
Excuse me?
Not such a fun place to visit.
Fucking depressing.
No offense.
None taken.
No one came to visit you, huh?
That must suck huge.
Well, it would suck huge, but I don't live here.
I'm just visiting someone.
Who?
Which one?
Beautiful woman with the shock of hair.
The one sitting with her husband?
- You might say that.
- Why wouldn't you?
I wouldn't say that because I'm her husband.
So why aren't you sitting with her, then?
Just learned to give her some space.
She's in love with that man she's sitting with.
I don't like to disturb her.
I just like to see her, I suppose.
Make sure she's doing well, you know?
I suppose that must seem rather pathetic.
I should be so lucky.
Come on.
She's not here.
She's sick.
He's not here, either.
I brought you a book.
It's all about Iceland.
Thought you might like to take a look at it.
Why, thank you.
Oh, what is it, dear heart?
What is it?
Oh, I see.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here, here, yes.
Do you by any chance have any influence around here?
I've seen you talking to them.
Oh.
We'll get to see each other.
You'll see.
We have to.
I'll come and see you, and you'll come and see me.
You know, I just wish his wife would hurry up and get here.
I wish she'd get him out of here and cut the agony short.
Should I stay?
Don't worry.
She's not sick, you know.
To keep her company.
Well, they have to learn to get over these things by themselves.
They've got short memories, and that's not always so bad.
Okay?
Fiona.
Her name is Fiona.
And what's yours?
I don't think I was ever told that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's Grant.
Hello, Grant.
I'm Marian.
Well, now that we know each other's name,
I can tell you straight out what I'm thinking.
I don't know if he's still so stuck on seeing your... seeing Fiona.
I don't ask him, he doesn't tell me.
But I don't feel like putting him back in there in case it turns out to be more than that.
I don't want him getting hard to handle.
I don't have any help.
It's just me here.
I'm it.
It is very hard for you.
Did...
Did you ever consider his going in there for good?
No.
I'm keeping him right here.
Well, that's very good and noble of you.
Oh, you think so?
Well, noble is not what I'm thinking about.
No, but it isn't easy.
No, it isn't, but I don't have a choice.
If I pay to put him in there, I won't hold on to the house, and the house is the only thing we own outright.
And it means a lot to me, this house does.
It's very nice.
Well, I guess it's all right.
I've done a lot on it, fixing it up, keeping it up.
Yes, I can see that you have... you do.
- I don't want to lose it.
- No.
- I'm not going to lose it.
- I see your point.
See, the company left us high and dry.
In the end, they said he owed them money.
What do I think?
Well, he was pretty stupid.
But I'm not supposed to ask, so I shut up.
You've been married, huh?
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.
And then, in the middle of all this, he gets sick from this virus, and he goes into a coma.
So that pretty much takes him off the hook, hmm?
It's bad luck.
It's, no, just life.
Can't beat life.
No.
Oh.
Hello.
Perhaps you'd like me to read to you.
I don't have any books.
Oh, there are some.
Letters from Iceland.
"Isn't it true, however far we've wandered
"into our provinces of persecution,
"where our regrets accuse, we keep returning
"back to the common faith
"from which we've all dissented,
"back to the hands, the feet, the faces?
"Children are always there and take the hands,
"even when they are most terrified.
"Those in love cannot make up their minds to go or stay.
"Artist and doctor return most often.
"Only the mad will never, never come back.
"For doctors keep on worrying while away,
"in case their skill is suffering and deserted.
"Lovers have lived so long with giants and elves,
"they want belief again in their own size.
"And the artist prays ever so gently,
"'Let me find pure all that can happen.
"'Only uniqueness is success.
"'For instance, let me perceive the images of history.
"'All that I push away with doubt and travel, today's and yesterday's alike, like bodies."'
To all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces now in the Middle East, the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you.
How could they forget Vietnam?
The air strike started again at 5 A. M. this morning and lasted for three hours.
Roadside explosions have killed eight Iraqi civilians and one U.S. soldier.
Here you go.
Next time you do it, just go pick it up, okay?
Her muscles are deteriorating.
If she doesn't improve soon, we're going to have to put her on a walker.
I keep trying to get her walking, but she doesn't seem to want to go anywhere.
But, you know, once they get on a walker, they start to depend on it, and then they don't want to walk much anymore, just get wherever it is they have to go.
You're going to have to work at her harder.
Try and encourage her.
Sorry.
Here you go.
Mrs. Andersson.
How would you like to go on a field trip?
They've kept it so like it was.
Who has?
The people who live here.
But everything...
Everything just reminds me of him.
It wasn't enough, I suppose.
Who, Fiona?
Who does everything remind you of?
I'd like to go home now, if you don't mind.
Now, as you know, we don't do extended care on the first floor.
I mean, we do it temporarily if someone isn't feeling well.
But if they progress too far, we have to consider moving upstairs.
Do you happen to have Aubrey's address?
I'm sorry?
Aubrey and his wife.
Where do they live?
Well, it was probably a mistake putting him there in the first place, but I wasn't going to get another chance to get away, so I took it.
Well, so...
Now I know better.
Did your husband ever work in a hardware store in the summers when he was going to school?
No, I never heard about that.
But I wasn't raised here.
No.
I didn't think so.
Thank you very much for your time, Miriam.
It's Marian.
Sorry.
What a jerk.
Yeah, maybe someone could just drop in on her, like, if the nurse is around.
All right.
No, I don't think there's much to it, but I'd like you to call me back.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I think I want to ask you about the second floor, just to know a little more about it.
Well, it's for people who've really lost it.
What do they do, then?
What happens after that?
After they've...
lost it?
You don't really want to know.
But, you know, sometimes they get it back.
They go into their room for a year, they don't know you from Adam, and then one day, it's, "Oh, hi.
When are we going home?"
I mean, all of a sudden, they're back to normal.
But it doesn't last for long.
You think, "Oh, wow, back to normal,"
and then they're gone again, like so.
I haven't even asked you about yourself.
You married?
Well, technically, yeah, I guess.
Got three kids.
Their dad lives in Alberta, I think.
He's making it rich, maybe.
I wouldn't know.
Must be quite a struggle.
It, uh... knocks the wind out of you every now and then, but you just pick yourself back up like everyone else.
I suppose our lives must seem easy to you.
We got through life without too much going wrong.
What we have to suffer now, when we're old, hardly counts, I suppose.
That's what you must think.
Well, how would you know what I think?
To tell you the truth, I'd rather be the one that stayed than the one that left.
I'll bet you weren't always the doggedly devoted husband.
Am I right?
I mean, you said that you wondered if maybe she was punishing you for something?
I'll bet you had something pretty specific in mind, didn't you?
You know, you see a lot of things in this job.
You see the end of things all day long.
And in my experience, at the end of things it's almost always the men that think that not too much went wrong.
I wonder if your wife feels the same way.
I wonder that, too.
I bet you do.
Uh, hello, Grant.
I hope I got the right person.
I just thought of something.
There is a dance here in town at the Legion on Saturday night, and I am on the supper committee, which means I can bring a free guest.
So I wondered whether you would happen to be interested in that.
Call me back when you get a chance.
555-3457.
I just realized I'd forgotten to say who it was.
Well, you probably recognize the voice, the accent.
It's Marian.
I'm still not so used to these machines, and I wanted to say I realize you're not single and I don't mean it that way.
I'm not, either.
But it doesn't hurt to get out once in a while.
Anyway, now I've said all this,
I really hope it's you I'm talking to.
It did sound like your voice.
If you're interested, you can call me.
And if you are not, you don't need to bother.
I just thought you might like the chance to get out.
It's Marian speaking.
I guess I already said that.
Okay, then.
Good-bye.
"The desires of the heart
"are as crooked as corkscrews.
"Not to be born is the best for man.
"The second-best is a formal order.
The dance's pattern:
dance while you can."
Fiona?
Is there any way to let this go... do you think?
If I let it go, it'll only hit me harder when I bump into it again.
Okay.
"Dance, dance, for the figure is easy.
The tune is catchy and will not stop."
"Dance till the stars
"come down from the rafters.
Dance, dance, dance till you drop."
Yes?
Hello, Marian.
So...
There you are.
Here I am.
Thank you.
What are you thinking?
Not an awful lot, really.
Skiing.
Downhill?
Cross-country.
I'm more a thrill-seeker, I guess.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking you never know how things are going to turn out.
You almost know... but you can never be quite sure.
Mr. Andersson?
Mr. Andersson?
Now, as you know, we're, uh, we're going to have to think about moving
Mrs. Andersson upstairs fairly soon, I'm afraid.
She hasn't been out of that bed for two weeks now, and...
I'm quite aware of your policies.
I'm more than aware of your bloody policies.
Well, once again, Nurse Kristy is taking me back to the second floor.
The area to my right are the elevators, and as we go on down the hall, there's a man with a broken heart, broken in a thousand pieces.
Well, we'll go to Madeleine's office, past the lunchroom.
Hopefully, they're serving right now.
The cannelloni was cold yesterday, but let's see what it's doing today.
Let's have...
I gotta have some Cokes again.
That's what I'm going to do.
Wouldn't it be better if... when we go out again, to put Aubrey back into Meadowlake?
Just for a day?
What do you think?
I'm thinking that sometimes you... just have to make the decision to be happy.
Just decide.
Things aren't ever what you hoped they'd be.
Not ever, for anybody.
The only thing that separates one kind of person from another is there are some who stay angry about it and there are some who...
accept what comes their way.
And which kind of person are you?
I was pretty mad about it.
But now... looking at what came my way...
I think I could be the other kind of person.
Quite the philosopher, huh?
Look, why don't you pull over here?
Just... pull over, could you?
I know what you're doing.
It would be easier for me if you could pretend a little.
Do you think you could do that?
Now, what were we talking about?
She was the only one in her family who bothered to learn sign language.
Now she can't remember how, or maybe even who she is.
Her daughter?
Yeah.
It's left her pretty stranded.
Marooned.
You know, I thought of you the other day.
You know that billboard out in front of the United Church in Bradford, they post all that biblical-type stuff?
The other day, it said,
"It's never too late to become what you might have been."
Doesn't sound all that biblical.
Well, maybe they're getting creative on us.
See you soon, Aubrey.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Would you mind if I had a moment alone before you come in?
To explain things to her?
I found this beautiful book about Iceland.
You wouldn't think they'd leave valuable books lying around.
People who stay here aren't all necessarily honest.
And I think they got the clothes mixed up.
I never wear yellow.
I seem to remember you reading this to me.
You were trying to make me feel better.
You tried so hard.
You're a lovely man, you know?
I'm a very lucky woman.
- Fiona?
- You've been gone a long time.
Are we all checked out?
I have a surprise for you.
Do you remember Aubrey?
Names elude me.
I'm happy to see you.
You could've just driven away.
Just driven away without a care in the world and forsook me.
Forsooken me.
Forsaken.
Not a chance.
She said,
"Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
Careful.
When did we last wash that sweater?
Right after the war.
Christmas.
In the "50s sometime or the"60s.
Shut up.
L"II go make the fire.
"You climbed the bank and said,
"This is how you touch other women,
"the grass cutter's wife, the lime burner's daughter.
"And you searched your arms for the missing perfume and knew..."
Don't worry, darling.
I expect I'm just losing my mind.
"What good is it to be the lime burner's daughter,
"left with no trace
"as if not spoken to in the act of love,
"as if wounded without the pleasure of a scar.
"You touched your belly to my hands in the dry air
"and said,"I am the cinnamon peeler's wife.
Smell me."
When I look away, I forget what yellow means.
But I can look again.
Sometimes there's something delicious in oblivion.
I think you're supposed to be able to put your fingers inside the curled petal and feel the heat.
Well?
I can't be sure.
I can't be sure if what I can feel is the heat or my imagination.
The heat attracts the bugs.
Nature never fools around just being decorative.
Yes?
I don't quite know how to introduce myself.
I used to see your husband at Meadowlake.
I'm a regular visitor there myself.
Those are lovely flowers.
I've never seen those purple ones before.
The earth there must really appeal to them.
What?
You could just open the drawers.
Remind yourself.
What?
Maybe all the labels and lists are defeating the purpose.
If you stopped thinking about things the moment you write them down, maybe that's the end of your need to recall.
I heard a story at a dinner party about the German soldiers on border patrol in Czechoslovakia during the war.
I heard it from that Czech student of yours.
Veronica.
We spoke once at a dinner party.
Don't be nervous.
It's a good story.
She told me that each of the German patrol dogs wore a sign saying "hund."
"Why?" said the Czechs.
And the Germans replied, "Because that is a hund."
It was one of those craft shows where you look around and wonder that the laws of supply and demand can allow for the production of so many macramé ducks.
Oh, God, those things are everywhere.
- What do you do with them?
- Come on, Phoebe, you've got one of those.
You use it as a... what do you call it... a light fixture holder or som...
- I do not.
- Phoebe, in the...
Oh, yes.
Wait a second, I do.
Fiona gave it to me.
Yes, I did.
Would anybody like some more?
Ween...
Wai...
Wain...
No, but I'll have a touch of wine.
Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.
Some more wain.
The thing is... half the time I wander around looking for something which I know is very pertinent.
I can't remember what it is.
Once the idea is gone, everything is gone.
I just wander around trying to figure out what it was that was so important earlier.
I think I may be beginning to disappear.
And what year is it?
2003.
Fiona, if you found a letter on the street, addressed, with a stamp on it, what would you do with it?
I'd mail it.
And where would you put it to mail it?
And if there was a fire in a movie theater, and you were the first person to spot that fire, what would you do?
Well, we don't go to the movies much anymore, do we, Grant?
All those multiplexes showing the same American garbage.
Have you seen my coat?
There it is, dear.
It's on your chair.
Oh, yes.
Fiona, would you mind if I asked you a few more questions?
Would you mind taking a seat?
I was just feeling a little cold, that's all.
What an ugly baby.
When did we move into this cottage?
Was it last year or the year before?
No.
It was longer than that.
It was when I left the university, 20 years ago.
Well, that's shocking.
Let's just see how it goes, shall we?
How is your husband doing?
Okay.
He and my wife struck up quite a close friendship.
I heard about that.
So, uh,
I'd like to speak to you about something.
If you have a minute.
My husband did not try to start anything with your wife, if that's what you're getting at.
He did not try to molest her.
He's incapable of it.
And anyway, he wouldn't.
From what I hear, it was the other way around.
No, uh, that isn't it at all.
I didn't come here with any complaints.
Oh.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.
Maybe you should come in.
It's not as warm a day as it looks.
"Never let a person make you feel guilty for your anger with God."
Hmm.
Random.
I can't even see what the point is.
We can't be certain this is what...
You're far too young.
"Should the patient afflicted with the disease
"remain at home... the caregiver will very often be the spouse."
"The caregiver must preside over the degeneration
"of someone he or she loves very much,
"must do this for years and years
"with the news always getting worse, not better,
"must put up sometimes with deranged
"but at the same time very personal insults,
"and must somehow learn to smile through it all.
"Caregivers must be able to diagnose
"a wide variety of ordinary ailments
"under extraordinary circumstances.
"Imagine the person you love the most
"suddenly upset about something,
"but completely unable to communicate the problem or even to understand it himself."
Sounds like a regular marriage.
Hello, there!
Oh!
Hello, there.
We are at that stage, Grant.
We are at that stage.
Well... if we do think of it... if we do... then it must be as something that isn't permanent.
A kind of experimental treatment or... a rest cure of sorts.
All right.
All right.
We can think of it that way.
We have to sit in the kitchen, where I can hear Aubrey.
Well, you might as well have a cup of coffee.
Thank you.
My son put him on the Sports Channel a year ago Christmas.
I don't know what we'd do without it.
Must be a struggle.
Well, you know.
You know what struggle is by now.
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.
You don't want to just get a sense of the place?
I don't want to make this decision alone.
What place?
Just kidding!
Fuck off.
You're not making this decision alone, Grant.
I've already made up my mind.
Okay.
It's time to go home now.
- No, no.
- Mrs. Taylor...
- Hi.
Is this your son?
- Yeah.
I'm her son.
Hi.
I'm Betty.
It's time for your bath.
- Bath.
- Yeah.
You have to have a bath now.
Mama.
Mr. Anderson?
Madeleine Montpelier.
- I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.
- Hi, there.
I'm just going to take you on the quick tour of the facility, and then we can sit down and discuss Mrs. Anderson's condition and the appropriate time for admitting her.
As you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Yes, I can see that.
This is my favorite room.
Look, over there, as you can see, they have a puzzle on the go.
They always have a puzzle on the go.
- This works.
- You know, it's real important to us here that our residents maintain social function, so a lot of our activities and our whole layout is really geared toward...
Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.
Hello, Michael.
Now, as you can see, we're coming into our common room, and again, we're really emphasizing everybody being social.
So you can bring the family.
Everybody can come and visit.
We have a state-of-the-art entertainment system so the residents can gather and watch together.
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, Madeleine.
- I got a Christmas sweater.
Aren't you festive!
And this is our quiet corner for crafts and reading and reflection.
We have a lot of activities for physical activity.
Balloon badminton and sit and fit.
And here we have our lovely new dining room.
We can accommodate any dietary preferences or restrictions.
We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner early for the families.
The old Meadowlake is just next door, and that's a day center now, but, um... this for the permanent residents.
This is brand-spanking new.
So let's go upstairs, shall we?
Just taking my tea for a ride.
Oh, look at this one, Flo.
He's a real charmer, isn't he?
Would you say, are you a charmer?
I think you could say I was kind of a charmer.
You're a rascal.
Mr. Anderson is here about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.
I should have known it.
At this age, it's...
What do the kids call it, Flo?
It's...
It's a real clusterfuck.
All the charmers are taken.
Or dead.
Mostly dead.
You're kind of charming yourself, sweetheart.
Shall we?
This is our second floor, the extended care wing.
The elevators, of course, have the lockdown system, and this is where the patients can move to once they become more progressed.
Interesting choice of words.
Why don't I show you some of the rooms here, while we're at it?
Then we can go back down and see the regular rooms where Mrs. Anderson will be living.
No, that will not be necessary.
My wife will not be progressing to this floor.
All right.
Who chooses the music?
I'm sorry?
I'm assuming it's not the residents.
I don't see any of them singing along.
Yeah, well.
You know the rooms on the regular floors all have their own stereo systems so the patients can listen to whatever they like.
How kind.
Now, we don't admit anyone during the month of December, so Mrs. Anderson will have to wait till January to make the big move.
Just December, Christmas, you know, too many emotional pitfalls.
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.
I'm looking for those documents on Aubrey Burke.
Sure.
Go ahead.
Mr. Anderson, this is Kristy, our new managing nurse.
Against some people's better judgment.
Now, now.
Mr. Anderson is here about his wife, Mrs. Anderson, who will be joining us in January.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
We also have a policy, which I'm sure you saw in the brochure, that our new residents are not allowed visitors or receiving phone calls during the first 30 days, just to give them a chance to settle in.
What sort of visitors?
Everyone.
Even close relatives.
I couldn't just leave her here.
We understand, it is very difficult to leave a loved one in a new environment for so long, but most people need that time to settle in.
Before we had this rule in place, residents would forget again and again why they were being left here.
Whereas we find, you give them the month to settle in, and they're happy as clams.
And after that, a little visit home every now and then, perfectly fine.
We'll take good care of her, I promise.
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, no!
Not again.
Knock-knock.
Boo.
- She's bringing two babies.
- Two babies?
She's got a new baby, four months old.
Smells good.
I was going to go for a ski, but I thought I shouldn't chance it, what with the Alzheimer's and all.
Why didn't you wake me?
What are these, Grant?
Those are the documents you're supposed to sign if you decide to go to Meadowlake.
That is exactly what I have decided.
You were to go and sign these and leave them there.
I wouldn't be allowed to visit you for 30 days.
30 days isn't such a long time after 44 years.
I don't think I like the place.
I don't think we should be looking for something we like, Grant.
I don't think we'll ever find that.
I think all we can aspire to in this situation is a little bit of grace.
I suppose I'll be dressed up all the time.
It will be sort of like... in a hotel.
How do I look?
Just like always.
Just as you've always looked.
And how does that look?
Direct and vague... sweet and ironic.
Is that how I look?
Oh.
Remember?
Surprised, Grant?
No, I'm not surprised.
I'm just grateful you can remember that.
I'm not all gone, Grant.
Just... going...
There are things I wish would go away.
But won't.
You know.
Things we don't talk about.
You never left me.
You still made love to me, despite disturbing demands elsewhere.
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.
What could you do but be a part of the time you were a part of?
All those pretty girls.
Didn't seem like anyone was willing to be left out.
I think you did all right, compared to some of your colleagues.
Those who left their wives.
And the women who wouldn't put up with it.
I think people are too demanding.
People want to be in love every single day.
What a liability.
And then that silly girl.
That silly girl Veronica.
Girls that age are always going around saying they're going to kill themselves.
But that was that.
Promised me a new life.
We moved out here, that is exactly what you gave me.
How long ago was that?
20 years.
God, that's shocking.
So you see, I'm going... but I'm not gone.
- Fiona.
- Grant.
Don't go.
That's what is happening, Grant.
It's happening... right now.
Fiona.
Hello.
I'm checking in today.
My name is Fiona Anderson.
Yes, Mrs. Anderson.
We have your room all ready for you.
- Perfect.
- We'll have our supervisor,
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.
L"II go fetch her.
She's expecting you.
Thank you.
Fiona.
Grant.
I can't go away from you like this.
We had nothing to tie us down, Grant.
You could have just driven away and forsaken me.
But you didn't.
I thank you for that.
- Mrs. Anderson.
- Oh, hello.
- How do you do?
I'm Madeleine.
- Hello.
Should I give you two a moment?
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.
All right, then, well, we'll get you settled in your room, and then I'd like to give you a tour of the facility.
- That'd be lovely.
Thank you.
- Right this way.
So, as you can see, we get a lot of natural light.
Here we go.
Yes.
This'll do just fine.
Good.
I'm so glad you like it.
Now, is... is this all you brought with you today?
- For now.
- We'll see how it goes.
Well, if you need any help arranging things, you just let me know.
Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.
Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say good-bye to my husband.
We haven't been apart for a month for the last 44 years.
It could be quite something.
Okay.
Please, Fiona.
Grant.
Fiona...
You know what I'd like?
I'd like to make love, and then I'd like you to go.
Because I need to stay here, and if you make it hard for me,
I might cry so hard I'll never stop.
Go now.
Go now.
"All of the officers
"were from outside the local area,
"and it probably had not entered their minds
"that almost all of us were named McDonald.
"Nobody moved except for the shuffling of feet.
The red roo"...
Hey.
- Hello, there.
- Kristy.
We met on your tour.
How's Mrs. Anderson?
Has she settled in?
I'm wondering if I could have a moment of your time to ask your advice?
Oh, sure.
I was just reading to Mr. Burke here.
Maybe when we finish this chapter,
I can come find you in the dining room?
Sure.
That's fine.
"The red roof lights revolved in the afternoon sun, and even the dogs were temporarily quiet."
Hi, there, Mr. Anderson.
Now, how can I help you?
Going down the center of the dining room...
That's Frank.
He used to be the play-by-play guy for the Winnipeg Jets.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He loved his job too much to retire.
Frank's on the second floor.
I just...
My wife has always been sort of a different sort of person.
I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be confirmed until after...
And on our way here today, we passed this conservation area where we went for a walk last spring.
And there were these gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.
Oh, those are beautiful, aren't they?
Yes, they really made an impression, see?
And even though the whole place was covered in snow, she said, "Oh, remember?"
Now, that was...
that was... quite recently.
And isn't the short-term memory the thing that goes first?
Well, yeah, but not all at once.
And what's comforting is the long-term memory sometimes stays for quite a long time.
Yeah, her long-term memory seems quite intact.
But when she mentioned that, about the skunk lilies, it was all I could do not to turn the truck around.
What if this is just her just being herself?
She's far too young to...
She is young.
And it is hard.
No doubt about that.
A month is a real long time.
I mean, between you and me, I don't know about the policy myself.
I think it makes it easier for the staff is what I think.
Look.
L"II give you my pager number.
You can call me whenever you want.
You can call me every day if you feel like it.
I don't know what to do.
Mr. Anderson, your wife wrote you this note, and she asked me to pass it along.
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Throughout much of the thinking brain, gooey plaques now crowd neurons from outside the cell membranes."
"And knotty tangles mangle microtubal transports from inside the cells."
"All told, tens of millions of synapses dissolve away."
"Because the structures and substructures of the brain
"are so highly specialized,
"the precise location of the neuronal loss determines what specific abilities will become impaired."
"It is like a series of circuit breakers in a large house, flipping off one by one."
That's a great-looking coffee maker.
I always meant to get one of those.
I saw they had them on sale at Canadian Tire.
They gave it to us, my son and his wife.
They live in Kamloops, B.C.
They send us more stuff than we can handle.
Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money to come see us instead.
I suppose they're busy with their own lives.
Not so busy they couldn't go to Hawaii last year.
I mean, you could understand it if there was someone in the family closer at hand, but, uh... he's the only one.
People do get lonely, especially when they're deprived of seeing someone they care about.
Fiona, for instance.
My wife.
I thought you said you went and visited her.
I do.
No, that's not it.
She's really settling in well.
Good.
Good.
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow, Mr. Anderson.
Right.
So I'll see you tomorrow morning, then.
Now, remember, she may be a little surprised to see you.
Don't be shaken by that.
Just...
She hasn't seen you in a while.
She's sort of settled in here.
I understand.
There you are.
L"II walk you down to her.
Wow.
Narcissus this early.
You must have spent a fortune.
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Anderson.
It's great to see you.
I'm gonna help you find your sweater, Mrs. Albright.
All right.
Here we are.
There is her room, right over there.
You remember from last time you were here, don't you?
Her nameplate's right on the door.
L"II leave you to it.
There she is.
Now you just go over and say hello, and try not to startle her...
Remember, she may not...
Well, just go ahead.
Bridge.
Deadly serious.
Quite rabid about it.
I can remember being like that at college for a while.
My friends and I would cut class and sit in the common room and smoke and play like cutthroats.
One's name was Phoebe.
I don't remember the others.
Phoebe Hart.
Oh, you knew her, too.
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?
I'm afraid the coffee's not up to much here.
I don't drink tea.
Oh.
I brought you some flowers.
I thought they might do to brighten up your room.
I went to your room, but you weren't there.
Well, no, I'm here.
So you've made a new friend.
Oh, that's just Aubrey.
The funny thing is I knew him years and years ago.
He used to work in the store, the hardware store where my grandpa used to shop.
He and I were always kidding around, but he never could get up the nerve to ask me out.
Until the very last weekend, he took me to a ball game.
But my grandpa showed up to drive us home.
I was up visiting for the summer.
Visiting my grandparents.
They lived in a cottage on a lake.
Fiona, I know where your grandparents lived.
It's where we lived.
We live.
Really?
I'd better go back.
He thinks he can't play without me sitting there.
It's silly.
I hardly know the game anymore.
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me.
Will you be through soon?
We should be.
I mean, it depends.
If you asked that grim-Looking lady over there nicely, she'll get you a cup of tea.
- No, I'm fine.
- I can leave you, then?
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.
But you'll be surprised how soon you get used to it.
You'll get to know who everybody is, except that some of them are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?
Can't expect them all to get to know who you are.
Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.
What do you think?
Do you think I'd look good with red hair?
You caught her at sort of a bad moment, involved in a game.
She isn't even playing.
Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.
Now, who is Aubrey?
That's who he is, Aubrey.
You know, they get these attachments.
That kind of takes over for a while.
Best buddy kind of thing.
Sort of a phase.
Does she even know who I am?
No, she might not.
Not today, and then, tomorrow you never know.
Things change back and forth all the time.
You'll see the way it is once you get used to coming here.
You'll learn not to take it so personal.
Learn to take it day by day.
Oh, I'm sorry.
L"II have to go and fix that now.
Here's Yung Menenikenaha, desperately clinging to his one-stroke lead.
Here's the swing.
It doesn't look good.
Looks like he's pushed it out to the right.
It lands 25 feet from the green.
This must be disappointing.
It doesn't look good for Yung Menenikenaha.
He was three strokes on the happy side of par until these last three holes.
Look at you, Mr. Anderson.
I think you might be one of our most frequent visitors.
Hi, Fiona.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
I brought you some books.
They don't seem to have an awful lot around here.
Letters from Iceland by Auden.
We always meant to read that together, didn't we?
Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?
Well, I don't know.
Um, Aubrey's card game starts in a few minutes, and then we usually go walking, and then he does his drawing...
Or perhaps you can find a bit of time later on.
Um, I'll stay here.
Or I'll come back in a few hours.
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?
Up comes Kapanen...
Boy, oh, boy!
Here we are at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.
It's sudden-death overtime.
They're tied 2-2.
Here are the Leafs again, led by Andreychuk.
He carries it over the blue line, winds up a shot right on!
The bounce, the rebound comes back behind the net.
McCabe couldn't get to it.
It goes back on the left wing and here come the Flyers led by Roenick again.
Roenick and Mitchell, what a twosome this two has been.
A shot right on!
Oh, it just went wide.
- Go for it, Frank.
- Over to the right side.
Here we go again.
The Leafs again.
Here's Sundin carrying it up over the line.
Can't get a shot away and it's cleared away by Philadelphia.
A loose puck grabbed by Philadelphia over on the left wing...
I just came down to say Aubrey is having his nap if you'd like to, um, talk.
Oh, sure.
Can we go somewhere a little more private?
...the side with Mitchell.
He shoots, he scores!
If...
If you'd like.
And Philly wins this series by a score of 3-2.
That's it this season for the Leafs.
Look at Phil Hitchcock.
Is he a happy coach.
Philadelphia wins 3-2.
The game is over in sudden-death overtime.
Y-You said you had some books for me?
This.
Letters from Iceland.
Yes, yes.
You said by Auden.
Yes.
That's right.
Now... where is Iceland?
Well, Iceland is in the middle of the Atlantic.
It's an island.
Youngest country in the world.
It's constantly erupting.
Volcanoes, earthquakes.
It's always shaking itself off.
Wouldn't it be nice to come from a young country?
You do.
That's where you're from.
That's where your people are from.
They immigrated here in the late 1800s.
But that's where you're from, Fiona.
And I teach...
Well, I taught the myths from there.
Norse mythology.
L-I must have been there, then.
Have I been there?
No.
Oh.
Why not?
Wasn't I curious?
You were very curious.
Very curious.
You always said there ought to be one place that you knew about and you thought about and maybe even longed for, but you did never did get to see.
Did I say that?
Yes, you said that.
Well, I'd better go and see to Aubrey.
He'll be wanting a little walk around, I suppose.
It was nice chatting.
You'll be back again tomorrow, I suppose?
Fiona, what are you doing...
What are you doing with Aubrey?
He doesn't confuse me.
He doesn't confuse me at all.
Well, it's been nice chatting.
L"II see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
These affections between residents, do they ever go too far?
Well, that depends on what you mean.
The problem we have here, it's funny.
It's actually often the ones who haven't been friendly with each other at all.
I mean, they maybe don't even know each other beyond knowing, like, is it a man or is it a woman?
And you'd think it'd be the old guys trying to crawl in bed with the old ladies, but half the time it's the other way around.
It's the old ladies going after the old men.
It could be they aren't so worn out.
Now don't get me wrong.
I don't mean Fiona.
Fiona is a lady.
She's a real lady.
I sometimes wonder...
You wonder what?
I wonder if she isn't putting on some kind of... charade.
A what?
Some kind of act.
Maybe some kind of punishment.
Why would she do that?
Oh.
Are you getting tired?
- No.
- Are you certain...
Excuse me.
Yes, Mr. Anderson?
How can I help you?
Fiona's wearing someone else's sweater.
Well, it's pretty, isn't it?
No, it's not pretty.
It's tacky.
- She would never wear it.
- Well, I'll tell you what.
You can talk to the duty attendant on Mrs. Anderson's wing.
Boy, it's a marvel, really, the way she's getting him up and out of that chair.
Can you manage?
Will you be all right?
L"II be back in a second.
Fiona, I'm your husband.
Fiona, it's Grant.
We've been married for 45 years.
Look at me, Fiona.
That is not your sweater.
We had a good life together.
Those are your words, Fiona, not mine.
That is not your sweater.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm coming straight back.
I'm coming straight back.
It's going to be all right.
L"II see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
Please... don't.
Please, please don't.
You're very persistent, aren't you?
I wish I...
Wish I knew what...
We'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.
You're not doing too well, are you?
Well, no big surprise.
What we're handling isn't so easy.
I thought when I married,
I'd be with someone to the final stretch.
I'm betting you thought the same.
Well, didn't work out.
So, I, uh, think you're here for a reason.
I'm the kind of person you can say things flat out to, so shoot.
I wonder if you would consider taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake, maybe just for a visit.
Or I suppose I could take Aubrey out there myself.
I wouldn't mind that at all.
Homemade.
Really?
No.
No, I can't do that.
And the reason is I don't want to upset him.
But wouldn't he understand it was just a visit?
He understands everything.
Now, if I go to all that trouble,
I'd prefer to take him someplace that'd be more fun?
It would make more sense to take him to the mall where there are kids and whatnot.
And then I'd have to get him all ready, maneuver him into the car.
He's a big man.
He's not that easy to manage.
Even if I agreed to do it?
You couldn't do it.
You don't know him.
You couldn't manage him.
And he wouldn't stand your doing for him.
And after all that, what would he get out of it?
Smoke?
No.
No, thanks.
What, did you never, or did you quit?
I quit.
How long ago?
Oh, 30 years, maybe more.
I quit quitting.
Just made a resolution to quit quitting, that's all.
So your wife's depressed, huh?
What's her name again?
I forget.
Fiona.
And how old were you when you met?
She was 18.
Holy, that's pretty young to get married, eh?
Wasn't my idea.
You mean she proposed to you?
Well, that's lovely, that's what I think.
How'd she do it?
She hadn't planned it necessarily.
We were in Tobermory waiting for the ferry to Manitoulin, and it was miserable and rainy, and she was in a good mood.
She didn't want any part of my sour mood.
And what'd she do, what'd she say?
Well, she said, "Do you think it'd be fun...
Do you think it'd be fun if we got married?"
And what did you say?
I took her up on it.
I shouted yes.
I never wanted to be away from her.
She had the spark of life.
You know, nothing can take away what's happened to you and what you've experienced.
I don't think so, anyway.
Even if it goes away somehow, it's still there.
It's still what you are.
It's curious.
What's curious?
All of that "madly in love" business.
The beginning.
I hear myself tell the story, and it all sounds so crucial.
I suppose it is.
But compared to what we ended up with, until recently... all of that seems so superficial somehow.
Not such a fun place to visit, eh?
Excuse me?
Not such a fun place to visit.
Fucking depressing.
No offense.
None taken.
No one came to visit you, huh?
That must suck huge.
Well, it would suck huge, but I don't live here.
I'm just visiting someone.
Who?
Which one?
Beautiful woman with the shock of hair.
The one sitting with her husband?
- You might say that.
- Why wouldn't you?
I wouldn't say that because I'm her husband.
So why aren't you sitting with her, then?
Just learned to give her some space.
She's in love with that man she's sitting with.
I don't like to disturb her.
I just like to see her, I suppose.
Make sure she's doing well, you know?
I suppose that must seem rather pathetic.
I should be so lucky.
Come on.
She's not here.
She's sick.
He's not here, either.
I brought you a book.
It's all about Iceland.
Thought you might like to take a look at it.
Why, thank you.
Oh, what is it, dear heart?
What is it?
Oh, I see.
Here.
Here.
Here.
Here, here, yes.
Do you by any chance have any influence around here?
I've seen you talking to them.
Oh.
We'll get to see each other.
You'll see.
We have to.
L"II come and see you, and you'll come and see me.
You know, I just wish his wife would hurry up and get here.
I wish she'd get him out of here and cut the agony short.
Should I stay?
Don't worry.
She's not sick, you know.
To keep her company.
Well, they have to learn to get over these things by themselves.
They've got short memories, and that's not always so bad.
Okay?
Fiona.
Her name is Fiona.
And what's yours?
I don't think I was ever told that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's Grant.
Hello, Grant.
I'm Marian.
Well, now that we know each other's name,
I can tell you straight out what I'm thinking.
I don't know if he's still so stuck on seeing your... seeing Fiona.
I don't ask him, he doesn't tell me.
But I don't feel like putting him back in there in case it turns out to be more than that.
I don't want him getting hard to handle.
I don't have any help.
It's just me here.
I'm it.
It is very hard for you.
Did...
Did you ever consider his going in there for good?
No.
I'm keeping him right here.
Well, that's very good and noble of you.
Oh, you think so?
Well, noble is not what I'm thinking about.
No, but it isn't easy.
No, it isn't, but I don't have a choice.
If I pay to put him in there, I won't hold on to the house, and the house is the only thing we own outright.
And it means a lot to me, this house does.
It's very nice.
Well, I guess it's all right.
I've done a lot on it, fixing it up, keeping it up.
Yes, I can see that you have... you do.
- I don't want to lose it.
- No.
- I'm not going to lose it.
- I see your point.
See, the company left us high and dry.
In the end, they said he owed them money.
What do I think?
Well, he was pretty stupid.
But I'm not supposed to ask, so I shut up.
You've been married, huh?
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.
And then, in the middle of all this, he gets sick from this virus, and he goes into a coma.
So that pretty much takes him off the hook, hmm?
It's bad luck.
It's, no, just life.
Can't beat life.
No.
Oh.
Hello.
Perhaps you'd like me to read to you.
I don't have any books.
Oh, there are some.
Letters from Iceland.
"Isn't it true, however far we've wandered
"into our provinces of persecution,
"where our regrets accuse, we keep returning
"back to the common faith
"from which we've all dissented,
"back to the hands, the feet, the faces?
"Children are always there and take the hands,
"even when they are most terrified.
"Those in love cannot make up their minds to go or stay.
"Artist and doctor return most often.
"Only the mad will never, never come back.
"For doctors keep on worrying while away,
"in case their skill is suffering and deserted.
"Lovers have lived so long with giants and elves,
"they want belief again in their own size.
"And the artist prays ever so gently,
"Let me find pure all that can happen.
"Only uniqueness is success.
"For instance, let me perceive the images of history.
"All that I push away with doubt and travel, today's and yesterday's alike, like bodies."
To all the men and women of the United States Armed Forces now in the Middle East, the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you.
How could they forget Vietnam?
The air strike started again at 5 A. M. This morning and lasted for three hours.
Roadside explosions have killed eight Iraqi civilians and one U.S. Soldier.
Here you go.
Next time you do it, just go pick it up, okay?
Her muscles are deteriorating.
If she doesn't improve soon, we're going to have to put her on a walker.
I keep trying to get her walking, but she doesn't seem to want to go anywhere.
But, you know, once they get on a walker, they start to depend on it, and then they don't want to walk much anymore, just get wherever it is they have to go.
You're going to have to work at her harder.
Try and encourage her.
Sorry.
Here you go.
Mrs. Anderson.
How would you like to go on a field trip?
They've kept it so like it was.
Who has?
The people who live here.
But everything...
Everything just reminds me of him.
It wasn't enough, I suppose.
Who, Fiona?
Who does everything remind you of?
I'd like to go home now, if you don't mind.
Now, as you know, we don't do extended care on the first floor.
I mean, we do it temporarily if someone isn't feeling well.
But if they progress too far, we have to consider moving upstairs.
Do you happen to have Aubrey's address?
I'm sorry?
Aubrey and his wife.
Where do they live?
Well, it was probably a mistake putting him there in the first place, but I wasn't going to get another chance to get away, so I took it.
Well, so...
Now I know better.
Did your husband ever work in a hardware store in the summers when he was going to school?
No, I never heard about that.
But I wasn't raised here.
No.
I didn't think so.
Thank you very much for your time, Miriam.
It's Marian.
Sorry.
What a jerk.
Yeah, maybe someone could just drop in on her, like, if the nurse is around.
All right.
No, I don't think there's much to it, but I'd like you to call me back.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I think I want to ask you about the second floor, just to know a little more about it.
Well, it's for people who've really lost it.
What do they do, then?
What happens after that?
After they've...
Lost it?
You don't really want to know.
But, you know, sometimes they get it back.
They go into their room for a year, they don't know you from Adam, and then one day, it's, "Oh, hi.
When are we going home?"
I mean, all of a sudden, they're back to normal.
But it doesn't last for long.
You think, "Oh, wow, back to normal,"
and then they're gone again, like so.
I haven't even asked you about yourself.
You married?
Well, technically, yeah, I guess.
Got three kids.
Their dad lives in Alberta, I think.
He's making it rich, maybe.
I wouldn't know.
Must be quite a struggle.
It, uh... knocks the wind out of you every now and then, but you just pick yourself back up like everyone else.
I suppose our lives must seem easy to you.
We got through life without too much going wrong.
What we have to suffer now, when we're old, hardly counts, I suppose.
That's what you must think.
Well, how would you know what I think?
To tell you the truth, I'd rather be the one that stayed than the one that left.
L"II bet you weren't always the doggedly devoted husband.
Am I right?
I mean, you said that you wondered if maybe she was punishing you for something?
L"II bet you had something pretty specific in mind, didn't you?
You know, you see a lot of things in this job.
You see the end of things all day long.
And in my experience, at the end of things it's almost always the men that think that not too much went wrong.
I wonder if your wife feels the same way.
I wonder that, too.
I bet you do.
Uh, hello, Grant.
I hope I got the right person.
I just thought of something.
There is a dance here in town at the Legion on Saturday night, and I am on the supper committee, which means I can bring a free guest.
So I wondered whether you would happen to be interested in that.
Call me back when you get a chance.
555-3457.
I just realized I'd forgotten to say who it was.
Well, you probably recognize the voice, the accent.
It's Marian.
I'm still not so used to these machines, and I wanted to say I realize you're not single and I don't mean it that way.
I'm not, either.
But it doesn't hurt to get out once in a while.
Anyway, now I've said all this,
I really hope it's you I'm talking to.
It did sound like your voice.
If you're interested, you can call me.
And if you are not, you don't need to bother.
I just thought you might like the chance to get out.
It's Marian speaking.
I guess I already said that.
Okay, then.
Good-bye.
"The desires of the heart
"are as crooked as corkscrews.
"Not to be born is the best for man.
"The second-best is a formal order.
The dance's pattern:
Dance while you can."
Fiona?
Is there any way to let this go... do you think?
If I let it go, it'll only hit me harder when I bump into it again.
Okay.
"Dance, dance, for the figure is easy.
The tune is catchy and will not stop."
"Dance till the stars
"come down from the rafters.
Dance, dance, dance till you drop."
Yes?
Hello, Marian.
So...
There you are.
Here I am.
Thank you.
What are you thinking?
Not an awful lot, really.
Skiing.
Downhill?
Cross-country.
I'm more a thrill-seeker, I guess.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking you never know how things are going to turn out.
You almost know... but you can never be quite sure.
Mr. Anderson?
Mr. Anderson?
Now, as you know, we're, uh, we're going to have to think about moving
Mrs. Anderson upstairs fairly soon, I'm afraid.
She hasn't been out of that bed for two weeks now, and...
I'm quite aware of your policies.
I'm more than aware of your bloody policies.
Well, once again, Nurse Kristy is taking me back to the second floor.
The area to my right are the elevators, and as we go on down the hall, there's a man with a broken heart, broken in a thousand pieces.
Well, we'll go to Madeleine's office, past the lunchroom.
Hopefully, they're serving right now.
The cannelloni was cold yesterday, but let's see what it's doing today.
Let's have...
I gotta have some Cokes again.
That's what I'm going to do.
Wouldn't it be better if... when we go out again, to put Aubrey back into Meadowlake?
Just for a day?
What do you think?
I'm thinking that sometimes you... just have to make the decision to be happy.
Just decide.
Things aren't ever what you hoped they'd be.
Not ever, for anybody.
The only thing that separates one kind of person from another is there are some who stay angry about it and there are some who...
accept what comes their way.
And which kind of person are you?
I was pretty mad about it.
But now...
Looking at what came my way...
I think I could be the other kind of person.
Quite the philosopher, huh?
Look, why don't you pull over here?
Just... pull over, could you?
I know what you're doing.
It would be easier for me if you could pretend a little.
Do you think you could do that?
Now, what were we talking about?
She was the only one in her family who bothered to learn sign language.
Now she can't remember how, or maybe even who she is.
Her daughter?
Yeah.
It's left her pretty stranded.
Marooned.
You know, I thought of you the other day.
You know that billboard out in front of the United Church in Bradford, they post all that biblical-type stuff?
The other day, it said,
"It's never too late to become what you might have been."
Doesn't sound all that biblical.
Well, maybe they're getting creative on us.
See you soon, Aubrey.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Would you mind if I had a moment alone before you come in?
To explain things to her?
I found this beautiful book about Iceland.
You wouldn't think they'd leave valuable books lying around.
People who stay here aren't all necessarily honest.
And I think they got the clothes mixed up.
I never wear yellow.
I seem to remember you reading this to me.
You were trying to make me feel better.
You tried so hard.
You're a lovely man, you know?
I'm a very lucky woman.
- Fiona?
- You've been gone a long time.
Are we all checked out?
I have a surprise for you.
Do you remember Aubrey?
Names elude me.
I'm happy to see you.
You could've just driven away.
Just driven away without a care in the world and forsook me.
Forsooken me.
Forsaken.
Not a chance.
5@y3
Stop the train!
There's a man on the tracks!
Open the door!
18-hour shift wasn't enough?
Now you're catching bodies on the way home?
Well, it's more like the bodies are catching me.
Wow, look at you.
You're all gussied up.
Fund-raiser for the mayor.
Randy Williams, freshman at Chelsea university.
I got an address at a campus residence.
Money and credit cards still on him.
Looks like he took a beating.
Couple of shots to the head, but there's no evidence...
Of a struggle here at the scene, so I'm thinking what happened, happened somewhere else.
Maybe that's where he lost his jacket.
It's freezing down here.
High concentration of metallic residue in his nostrils and on the front of the clothing.
Steel dust from the wheels of the train?
Not enough dust on this track to merit the amount found on the clothing and in his nose.
Must have picked it up somewhere else in the subway.
Where?
Rust-colored droplets here...
On the chest and the shoulder.
It's not blood.
Still wet.
Satellite spatter and the placement of the drops suggest the Vic was...
Standing up but moving at a high rate of speed.
This kid was subway surfing.
And he never made it out of the tube.
Risk
Well, hello, Miss Monroe.
You clean up nice.
You go to the mayor's party also?
I was at the opera.
I am hanging out with all the wrong people.
You know that?
So, this is our subway surfer?
As far as I can tell, he didn't fall from the top of subway car.
There are no injuries consistent with a fall from that height at that speed.
What about the bruising?
Looks like it was caused by a significant impact.
It wouldn't have that if the body was dragged here and dumped.
The scapula and ribs aren't broken.
The clavicle didn't collapse.
Means...
He didn't bounce, flip, ricochet, nothing.
When he landed, he stayed put.
All inconsistent with a...
Fall from the top of moving train.
So he was subway surfing but he didn't die doing it.
Pushed, fell, thrown, whatever.
This guy came off of the train in front of mine.
So someone on that train must have seen something.
I'll start with the body.
You two start with the person who watches everyone get on and off the train.
Wood splinter from your Vic's forehead.
And more where this came from.
The splinters entered the skin at a sideways angle.
My guess is with a wooden stick or a club.
The blow was fatal.
He died instantly?
No.
Could have taken a few hours.
He suffered significant swelling of the frontal lobe, then flatline.
Here...
let's roll him.
These scratches are scabbed over, probably a couple of days old.
Looks like a special someone left her mark.
This story isn't over.
At first glance, it looked like a compound fracture.
I pulled this from his hand.
A shark's tooth?
Coney Island trink or real?
I'm not sure...
But it took a whole lot of force to drive it through his hand.
That's just the first course of our seafood buffet.
Take a look at this.
Want to go fishing?
Until they're cleaned up, it'll be difficult to determine species.
There's a lot of superficial damage from the stomach acids.
I'll send this toxic stew over to Adam in trace.
I estimate the fish were ingested less than 45 minutes prior to your Vic's death.
They were alive when he swallowed them, but they didn't last very long.
Neither did he.
Q.T. Jammer, the most notorious trader in Manhattan.
This guy was a Rambo.
Half a billion in assets, trades commodities for a living.
You think betting the NFL's tough, try betting on pork bellies, coffee or grain.
How do you bet on grain?
Listen, what I don't spend, I put in the bank.
What makes a hotshot like this jump out his window?
Bad day in the market?
Hurricane Katrina...
Terrorism, nuclear threat in North Korea, bird viruses.
Commodities is a risky business.
Anything at anytime can make the market tank.
Okay, I want to box all of his computers.
Take them back to the lab, find out what kind of day he was really having.
Sorry for the delay.
Q.T. and I were busy necking.
Come again?
Necking...
Looking at his neck.
You don't think I'd kiss a corpse, do you?
No, no, of course not.
- That's disgusting.
- I agree.
Long as we got that straight...
So, said...
- Cause of death?
- Cause of death, asphyxiation.
However, not from hanging out of a 40-story window.
Tachea in both eyes...
But no hemorrhaging in the ligature furl on the neck.
So his heart stopped pumping blood before he was hung.
Strange thing is, he was strangled at some point prior to his death.
See the bruising around his neck?
The noose didn't make these marks.
These are fingernail marks dug into the neck.
Lucky for us, the killer had something chalky underneath the nails.
Look at the thumb bruise.
All right, let's run a mass spec on that.
See what this guy had his hands on aside from Q.T. Jammer's neck.
There's something green in his throat.
Do I really want to look?
Evidence knows no bounds.
Hold it.
Give me a second here.
Yeah, perfect, perfect.
Green fibers...
My guess is the killer suffocated him with something green.
A pillow, a towel...
handkerchief, maybe?
All right, let's run a tox.
This case just went from suicide to murder.
I'm Bobby Martin, his "under" broker.
I work under Q.T., cold-calling clients managing new accounts.
How was business today?
Chernobyl.
We had a down day in the market...
Mr. Jones, we are at "Defcon Five" in this climate.
Your pork belly and cattle contracts are losing $50,000 a penny.
We're down ten cents already this morning.
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Jammer, but there are ten calls waiting.
- Not now, Debbie!
- Talk to me, Jammer.
Sir, at this point, it's simply about how much pain we can withstand.
About what time did you find him?
Not long after the market closed.
This ought to cheer you up.
D.O.A. just announced a huge drought in Brazil.
Oh, my god!
Q.T.!
I ran to the secretary's desk and I dialed 911.
Then, I went to the bathroom and threw my guts up.
Where was the secretary during all this?
She left not long after the market closed.
You know, she's a part-timer.
A temp.
What about the other brokers?
Did they all leave after the bell, too?
They're on a retreat at Club Med.
Q.T. stayed back.
He said he wanted to...
Earn some extra money to help build his lagoon pool.
Looks like someone threw a vase.
Is this the only security camera on this floor?
As far as I know, yeah.
Educate me.
Why would you need a surveillance camera in a brokerage firm?
Q.T.'s got a lot of million-dollar clients.
Not all of them know how to swallow losses like the ones we had today.
Subway surfing was much more popular, late '80s, '90s.
But we still get these doot-DA-doots every once in a while.
"Doot-DA..." whats?
Doot-DA-doots.
You know...
Idiot, moron, knucklehead.
Where you from, Jersey?
Forget about that.
We think a kid was surfing the rear car of your train last night.
You sure he came from my train?
Yeah, it had to, because the victim was lying across the tracks, and I was riding the train behind yours when I saw him.
If another train passed, he would've been sliced in half.
- It's the risk these kids take?
- Yeah.
I don't get it.
Mr. White, you're the conductor.
Did you notice anything unusual on that run?
I see "unusual" on every run.
It's a subway.
You want unusual, you're going to find it.
Well, do you remember anybody causing any trouble?
Any doot-DA-doots get your attention?
That's very nice.
She used it in a sentence and everything.
Look,
I open and close the doors.
I'm all about staying on schedule.
Last night...
Wasn't different than any other night, nothing special.
That's it.
We're going to take a look at your train.
And do me a favor, in the meantime, if you remember even the littlest thing,
- get in touch.
- All right.
Look, if you need anything else, just call.
They got to pay me overtime every time they change my run.
So I'm always available, if you know what I mean.
All right.
I got blood, and a load of footprints up here.
How you doing?
Typical new York city subway car.
A million fingerprints and a smorgasbord of trace.
I got evidence of two surfers up here.
And it looks like they both made it down from the roof.
Looks like Mac was right, Monroe.
They had him down and back inside the train.
I've got medium velocity blood spatter.
Looks like we may have found our primary crime scene.
All right.
Now all we've got to do is find our secondary surfer.
Okay.
Chill out.
What time is it?
We're looking for Perry Lohmann, Randy William's roommate.
What's happened?
That's what we're here to find out.
Mind if we come in?
Thank you.
Perry Lohmann, wake up.
Subway surfer, we've got to talk.
You're a lucky boy.
Can I use the bathroom?
- I'm a little hung-over.
- Make it quick.
You can have a seat.
I like what you did with the place.
- Don't move, don't move.
- What the hell did I do?
Nice collar, Monroe.
I already told you.
I ran because I figured I did something wrong.
Sometimes when I drink, I do stupid things.
Things I don't remember.
Yeah, well, you remember how Randy Williams ended up dead?
I still can't believe he's dead.
I was just with him.
We went partying.
He can't be dead.
Those are some interesting scratches on your back, Perry.
Randy Williams had the same scratches.
It must have made you kind of angry that he was sleeping with your girlfriend.
Actually, I'm Randy's girlfriend.
Randy and I have been going out since high school.
I didn't want to hurt him.
Perry and I...
It just happened.
So where were you and Randy partying?
I don't know.
Lot's of places I guess.
I was trashed.
I only remember bits and pieces.
Start with the bits.
We... we were at some club...
On Broadway.
Broadway's the longest street in the world, kiddo.
There were girls dancing.
We had a problem with the bouncer.
That's all I remember.
Well, that narrows it down.
How about some more bits?
You said you had a problem with a bouncer?
We were way out of line.
We pissed him off.
He and Randy really got into it.
Hey, watch it, Jerk!
Man, leave him alone!
What the hell?
!
Randy was hot.
He wanted another shot at the guy.
We waited outside until the bar closed.
Then you confronted the bouncer?
We followed him into the train station.
They had words that's it.
The train came, we got on and went to the back.
You see the bouncer on the train?
Not that I remember.
Look, we were clubbing, got trashed, got stupid, headed home, the usual.
I left Randy on the train, went to another club and now he's dead.
You remember surfing on the train with Randy?
Maybe, I don't know.
We do it sometimes.
We were hammered.
Do you remember killing Randy Williams and throwing his body on the tracks?
Look, I've got nothing else to say.
You like being punished, Perry?
'Cause that's what we do.
Except we don't tie you to the bed, and spank you with some pledge paddle.
We throw you in jail.
So you won't mind if I borrow this, right?
See if Randy Williams got a punishment he didn't deserve.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How's our security camera treating us?
Well, I looked at the footage from about an hour before the market opened through the trading day.
Not much happening.
Q.T. Jammer's under broker, Bobby Martin, pouring himself a cup of coffee in reception.
Secretary leaves right after the closing bell.
That kind of thing.
Then...
This guy comes in... and he's not happy.
And here's...
Where the broken vase comes in.
Did you get a name for our angry guy?
Name and a location.
Good.
Mr. Reiter, do you want to put the weights down, please?
When I finish my set. 48...
Mr Reiter, we need to talk to you about the losses you took in the market.
-... 50.
- Right now, Mr. Reiter.
Bunny...
What's my money got to do with you?
Q.T. Jammer's dead.
What'd he do, jump out a window?
Now why would you say that?
I'm sure all of his clients took a bath yesterday.
Including me.
Mueller's magic grip.
Athletic adhesive used for rock climbing, discus throwing and look here...
weight lifting
What's all this about?
We know you paid Q.T. Jammer a visit earlier in the day.
And thanks to your powder here, we suspect you had your hands around his neck.
Look, it's not every day you lose $2.4 million in six hours.
So I paid him a visit.
We had a little client-broker heart-to-heart.
Just the two of us.
Look, orange juice is down for a very good reason, Mr. Kartzinel.
Farmers are worried about another Katrina.
The only thing in the market today is oil, and that's only because Bush wants 22-inch rims on his golf cart.
You got me in to this market, you better get me out, or I'll pop your head off like a mushroom!
I lost my temper... and my money.
- And a vase.
- What?
You want me to reimburse him?
I think I could find five bucks.
Let me get my wallet.
Yeah, do that.
We're going to need your I.D. to file assault charges.
Give me some good news, Adam.
This is the contents of Randy Williams' stomach.
I found chunks of macadamias, almonds and cashews.
Perfect description of bar mix.
What about the shark's tooth?
I'm still trying to figure out how something like that got stuck in his hand.
There you go.
There's tool marks at the top of the tooth, by the roots.
Looks like it was mounted on some type of setting.
Maybe a necklace or a key chain.
No broken chain or setting found at the crime scene, no indication that the tooth belonged to the victim.
Strange case, you know?
Bar nuts, shark tooth, tropical fish.
Betta splenden...
Or Siamese fighting fish, to be exact.
The brilliant colors are exclusive to males, males in the same tank will kill each other.
Ironic.
No... wild, wild, wet.
Whoa!
That's a very hip...
Very salacious Manhattan club.
That just kind of popped in your head like that?
And your point?
Well, I just... you know, I...
I didn't think that you would...
The bar's over on Broadway, near Chelsea University.
Fighting fish on every table.
It's a short train ride from where Randy Williams was found.
You're the man!
You can hang anywhere you want, huh?
I was at the scene of a crime, Adam.
Bouncers went a little overboard, ended up killing some kid from Staten Island.
Shrimp cocktail is fantastic.
Get me something more on that tooth.
I like shrimp.
I remember him, yeah.
Two guys.
College kids.
Couldn't hold their liquor.
Come in the other night causing trouble, so I taught 'em a lesson.
What kind of lesson?
They were swallowing live fish, knocking over drinks, causing big problems.
Oh, my god, he's eating the fish.
Hey, what are you doing?
I softened him up a bit.
Enough of a lesson that he won't be coming back anytime soon.
The kid in the picture won't be coming back at all.
He's dead.
Axe handle.
Who does this belong to?
Paul Bunyan was in last night.
He must've left it.
Well, you won't mind if I hang onto it until Mr. Bunyan comes back.
I don't care if you stand in the corner and spit wooden nickels.
I got nothin' to hide.
Looks like blood.
You keeping score on how many heads you bash in?
Put it this way.
There ain't a notch on the bat with that kid's name on it.
You better hope not...
Or you'll be living in an eight-by-ten cell with your name on it.
The "c" in this case does not just stand for "commodities."
- What's it stand for?
- Chloroform.
Tox came back on our Vic.
Someone knocked him out and then tossed him out.
So we've got our "how," we just need to find the "who."
Okay, take a look at this.
Minutes after Seamus Reiter left the building, this man walked into the office,
- wearing a three-piece suit and...
- Green handkerchief.
He was wearing it when he walked into the office...
But...
Not when he walked out.
Here's the catch.
We can't prove that he went in to Q.T. Jammer's office.
But...
Sign-in at reception has a Cecil Arthur visiting the floor around that time.
He's a client.
His profits for the day, $840,000.
He's actually one of the few who made money.
Who makes money and kills his broker?
Those commissions can be murder.
Cecil Arthur?
Yeah.
This is how we feed the world.
Why don't you stop feeding the world for a minute and come over and talk to us.
I'm giving back to the earth that has given back to me.
N.Y.P.D.
The pigeons can go hungry for a minute, okay?
Buddy, you got three seconds to stop doing that before I come in there and get you.
Oh, for the love of Caesar.
Eat!
Out of the limo now, I says!
That's how I live my life.
When I lose in the market, I lay in bed and eat fig newtons all day.
If I score, I celebrate by giving back to mother earth.
Mr. Arthur, just answer the question.
Why would I want to harm him?
Q.T. was my broker, we had a phenomenal day in the market yesterday.
At least I did, anyway.
Not to mention that I am the most important client he has in his book.
His book?
The manifest of clients.
He handles 81 speculators, net worth of $50 million apiece.
I have $700 million with him myself.
Where's your green handkerchief?
You had one when you went into Q.T. Jammer's office.
You came back out without it.
I sneezed.
What's that bulge in your pocket?
And don't get cute.
Circular stain.
Can you explain that?
It turns out Mother Nature gave something back to me.
They say it's good luck, you know?
We'll find out.
How we making out with the wood samples, Danny?
Not good.
And Adam called:
Blood from the ax handle doesn't come back to our Vic.
Means the bouncer used it on somebody else.
Take a look.
Splinter on the left is from the ax handle, splinter on the right's from our Vic's forehead.
Like the frat paddle:
Doesn't match.
So the search goes on...
For our murderer and our murder weapon.
What you got there?
Results on the handkerchief.
Negative for chloroform, positive for bird crap.
The shark tooth you guys found is from the great white.
Now, the length and the number of points along the edge of the tooth is used to determine the size and the species of the shark.
This one was around 21 feet long and weighed over 2,500 pounds.
Great whites are migratory fish.
Right?
They're prevalent all up and down the East Coast.
Not to mention a bunch of other places.
Which is where my closer look comes in.
Check this out.
See, the enamel on this tooth is worn.
Aren't most shark's teeth that are sold commercially fossils that have lacquer preservative?
This tooth came right from the shark's mouth, so...
The person who owned it likely caught the fish or knew the person who did.
That could be in Australia, for all we know.
My friend Grateloupia Turuturu would beg to differ.
Brown algae?
A microscopic diatom found in the pulp of the shark's tooth, usually found in cooler waters of the North Atlantic.
Now, only two sharks of this size have ever been caught on the North Atlantic coast, and the last one was in '92.
If I could get my hands on the list of fishermen who are involved in the charter boats...
Maybe a name pops up?
Good job, Adam.
Remember that question on the CSI training exam?
Look, there are a lot of questions on the training exam, Hawkes.
There was a chloroform question about solvents, leaching versus bleaching.
What's your point?
Yes, I was just looking at your overall photos, more specifically, this one with the pillows.
Now, we're looking for something green that might've been used to smother him, right?
The pillows on this couch aren't green.
That's my point.
Maybe the pillow used wasn't green.
Chloroform can sometimes act as a solvent when it comes in contact with fabrics.
Leaching can occur and turn certain dyes a different color.
Like turning a blue pillow green.
We can't get a print off a pillow.
Who was the last person to see Q.T. Jammer alive?
Bobby Martin.
I've been through this footage a thousand times, and his alibi checks out.
Bobby got a cup of coffee in reception...
Went to the bathroom for two minutes, and then walks out of frame.
Okay, and that's when he comes out and calls 9-1-1.
So we can only assume that he went into Q.T.'s office, found him dead and came out to make the call.
And according to him, he went into the bathroom and puked his guts out.
- Can I sit for a second?
- Sure.
I'm gonna rewind the tape for a second.
I've been here for a couple of minutes.
The steam on my tea is still going strong.
He walks into the bathroom with a steaming cup of coffee.
Seconds later, he walks out.
No steam.
He knew he was on camera.
Yeah.
He went into the bathroom, he emptied out his coffee, put the chloroform in the paper cup.
Only I checked that office high and low,
I didn't find any paper cup.
Let's fast-forward the footage.
Came out of Q.T.'s office without it.
Probably hid the cup on his person, threw it away in the bathroom when he was supposed to be throwing up.
Exactly.
That's how he got rid of it.
Yeah.
Evidence gone.
Taken away by the cleaning crew.
This isn't gonna get taken away by the cleaning crew.
The "C" exchange by-laws.
From the editor who wrote the Times article.
Seems the underbroker told a big fib.
When Q.T. Jammer went out the window, his underbroker,
Bobby Martin, inherited his book.
Okay, so we don't have the paper cup, but we have the motive.
Gentlemen, we have to find that cup.
You get anything else from the splinters, Boss?
Yeah.
Antifreeze.
Antifreeze?
You might wanna take a look at what Lindsay and I pulled from the New York public library.
Tell me on the fly.
What's the rush?
I have a train to catch.
We're gonna take a little ride, Mr. White.
We need to talk.
It's a tragedy to all of us, Ms. Chandler, but the market goes on.
By sunrise, we'll be open for business, and I'd be honored to make you a killing.
And I'd be honored to bust you for a killing.
Hang up the phone, Bobby.
Bobby?
You look good in this office, Bobby.
You look like you'd kill to be here.
You murdered Q.T. Jammer.
We pulled your print off the paper cup.
S.E.C. demands that all its brokers get printed when they receive their series 7 license.
Your name just popped up like that.
What it didn't say was whether you take chloroform with your coffee or not.
We also found this.
"C" exchange by-laws.
You stood to inherit his book.
Q.T. Jammer was the senior partner.
You were the underbroker.
You knew staging his death as a suicide would enable you to get your hands on all of his clients.
We lost $17 million that day, and I did the impossible.
I made Cecil Arthur money.
Tough day, huh, Q.T.?
Chernobyl.
It's a good thing Cecil Arthur took my advice.
He made a killing on those oil contracts.
What are you, an authority?
You make one right trade, and all of a sudden you're an expert?
Get the hell out of my office!
Go fetch me my coffee, cold caller.
Q.T. Jammer's got a short memory, and like every other mega-millionaire egomaniac, he thinks he's the genius.
You bring $700 million into a commodities firm, you get made partner.
Not here.
After three years,
I was gonna get mine one way or the other.
So what, were you gonna party making millions, is that it?
You think this is about the money?
This is not about the money.
It's about the book.
Because, you see, life is about being at the right place at the right time for the right reason.
Winning and losing fortunes with a single touch of a button!
Now, if that's not living, nothing is!
That's not living, it's called gambling, and you just ran out of luck, Pal.
Put your hands behind your back.
Market's closed.
Let's go.
This better be good, Detective.
Train master's not gonna be happy that I was pulled off my run and the trains were delayed again.
You let me worry about that.
You ever heard of ethylene glycol?
I can't say that I have.
It's an antifreeze used on the electrified third rail.
Keeps it from freezing in the winter.
Well, that's very interesting.
What does it have to do with me?
Well, some of the splinters taken from the victim's head wound were saturated with ethylene glycol.
Yeah, so?
Your shoe paddle is used to separate the contact shoe from the train from the electrified third rail.
Over time, the wood absorbs the ethylene glycol.
Yeah, well, there's a ton of shoe paddles in the system.
Every conductor has one.
Not all of them.
Test positive for blood.
You're gonna have to do better than that, Detective, or we're done here.
We're done when I say we're done.
Stand up.
Lift your jacket.
So I like fishing.
What the hell's this got to do with anything?
It means that the shark's tooth missing from the setting on your key chain here was found embedded in Randy Williams' hand.
That tooth came from that shark.
Your train was running late that night.
Reports were filed to explain the delays.
Randy Williams and his roommate were slowing you down.
Okay, I ain't gonna tell you punks again.
If I got to stop the train one more time for you dirt bags,
I'm gonna come back here, and I'm gonna hurt somebody.
You ain't gonna do nothin'!
Get back in your choo-choo box.
These kids nowadays, they got no respect.
Every man has a breaking point.
Get off the door.
Last chance, Randy.
One more drink?
You go ahead, man.
I'm done.
Get out of here.
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
You ever had anybody spit in your face, Detective?
I have been hit with soda bottles, cans, called every name in the book, but nobody's ever gonna spit in my face.
You deserved it, Captain Crunch.
You're just a two-bit conductor.
So somehow, beating a drunk and vulnerable kid to death and throwing him out the back of a train makes it right?
I make $43,000 a year to keep this thing moving.
People depend on me and these trains for their livelihood.
But who's got my back?
Who cares about me, the working man?
I did...
Until you broke the law.
Hey, Mac, I'm on the train now.
I'll probably gonna lose you.
I'm doing a 4:00 to 12:00 tomorrow.
I'll see you then.
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go straight home,
I'm not finding any bodies.
Trust me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bye, bye you too.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, get out of here.
Hey, how you doing?
Re-sync, spell check by Ikati...
C.S.I. N.Y. Season 2 Episode 13
18-hour shift wasn't enough?
Now you're catching bodies on the way home?
Well, it's more like the bodies are catching me.
Wow, look at you.
You're all gussied up.
Fund-raiser for the mayor.
Randy williams, freshman at chelsea university.
I got an address at a campus residence.
Money and credit cards still on him.
Looks like he took a beating.
Couple of shots to the head, but there's no evidence of a struggle here at the scene, so I'm thinking what happened, happened somewhere else.
Maybe that's where he lost his jacket.
It's freezing down here.
High concentration of metallic residue in his nostrils and on the front of the clothing.
Steel dust from the wheels of the train?
Not enough dust on this track to merit the amount found on the clothing and in his nose.
Must have picked it up somewhere else in the subway.
But where?
Rust-colored droplets here-- on the chest and the shoulder.
It's not blood.
Still wet.
Satellite spatter and the placement of the drops suggest the vic was standing up but moving at a high rate of speed.
woo!
Hoo-hoo!
yeah!
This kid was subway surfing.
And he never made it out of the tube.
Out here in the fields
I fought for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah.
Well, hello, miss monroe.
Wow, you clean up nice.
You go to the mayor's party also?
I was at the opera.
I am hanging out with all the wrong people.
You know that?
So, this is our subway surfer?
As far as I can tell, he didn't fall from the top of subway car.
There are no injuries consistent with a fall from that height at that speed.
What about the bruising?
Looks like it was caused by a significant impact.
It wouldn't have that if the body was dragged here a dumped.
The scapula and ribs aren't broken.
The clavicle didn't collapse.
Means he didn't bounce,flip, ricochet,nothing.
When he landed, he stayed put.
All inconsistent with a fall from the top of moving train.
So he was subway surfing but he didn't die doing it.
Pushed, fell,thrown,wthatever.
This guy came off of the train in front of mine.
So someone on that train must have seen something.
I'll start with the body.
You two start with the person who watches everyone get on and off the train.
Wood splinter from your vic's forehead.
And more where this came from.
The splinters entered the skin at a sideways angle.
My guess is with a wooden stick or a club.
The blow was fatal.
-He died instantly?
-No.Could have taken a few hours.
He suffered significant swelling of the frontal lobe,then flatline.
Here...
let's roll him.
These scratches are scabbed over, probably a couple of days old.
Looks like a special someone left her mark.
This story isn't over.
At first glance, it looked like a compound fracture.
I pulled this from his hand.
A shark's tooth?
Coney island trink or real?
I'm not sure,but it took a whole lot of force to drive it through his hand.
That's just the first course of our seafood buffet.
Take a look at this.
Want to go fishing?
Until they're cleaned up, it'll be difficult to determine species.
There's a lot of superficial damage from the stomach acids.
I'll send this toxic stew over o adam in trace.
I estimate the fish were ingested less than 45 minutes prior to your vic's death.
They were alive when he swallowed them, but they didt last very long.
Neither did he.
Q.T.Jammer,the most notorious trader in manhattan.
This guy was a rambo.
Half a billion in assets, trades commodities for a living.
You think betting the nfl's tough, try betting on pork bellies,or grain
How do you bet on grain?
Listen, what I don't spend, I put in the bank.
What makes a hotshot like this jump out his window?
Bad day in the market?
Hurricane katrina..terrorism..nuclear threat in north korea..bird viruses.
Commodities is a risky business.
Anything at anytime can make the market tank.
Okay,I want to box all of his computers.
Take them back to the lab,find out what kind of day he was really having.
Uh... sorry for the delay.
Q.T. And I were busy necking.
-Come again?
-Necking...
Looking at his neck.
You don't think I'd kiss a corpse, do you?
No,no,of course not.
-That's disgusting.
-I agree.
Long as we got that straight...
so,said...cause of death.
Cause of death, Asphyxiation.
However,ot from hanging out of a 40-story window.
Tachea in both eyes,but no hemorrhaging in the ligature furl on the neck.
So his hea stopped pumping blood before he was hung.
Strange thing is,he was strangled at some point prior to his death.
See the bruising around his neck?
The noose didn't make these marks.
These are fingernail marks dug into the neck.
Lucky for us,the killer had something chalky underneath the nails.
Look at the thumb bruise.
All right, let's run a mass spec on that.
See what this guy had his hands on aside from Q.T.Jammer's neck.
There's something green in his throat.
-Do I really want to look?
-Evidence knows no bounds. -
Hold it, hold it.
Give me a second here.
Yeah, perfect...perfect.
Grfibers...
My guess is the killer suffocated him with something green.
A pillow,a towel...handkerchief, maybe?
All right, let's run a tox.
This case just went from suicide to murder.
I'm bobby martin, his "under" broker.
I work under Q.T...
Cold-calling clients managing new accounts.
-How was business today?
-Chernobyl.
We had a down day in the market...
Mr.Jones,we are at "defcon five" in this climate.
Your pork belly and cattle contracts are losing $50,000 a penny.
We're down ten cents already this morning.
Sorry to interrupt,Mr.Jammer,
-but there are ten calls waiting.
-Not now, debbie!
-Talk to me, jammer.
-Sir, at this point, it's simply about how much pain we can withstand.
-About what time did you find him?
-not long after the market closed.
This ought to cheer you up.
D.O.A.
Just announced a huge drought in brazil.
Oh, my god!
Q.T.!
I ran to the secretary's desk and I dialed 911.
Then, I went to the bathroom and threw my guts up.
Where was the secretary during all this?
She left not long after the market closed.
You know, she's a part-timer.
A temp.
What about the other brokers?
Did they all leave after the bell,too?
They're on a retreat at club med.
Q.T. stayed back.
He said he wanted to earn some extra money to help build his lagoon pool.
-Looks like someone threw a vase.
-Yeah.
Is this the only security camera on this floor?
As far as I know,yeah.
Educate me.Why would you need a surveillance camera in a brokerage firm?
Q.T.'S got a lot of million-dollar clients.
Not all of them know how to swallow losses like the ones we had today.
Subway surfing was much more popular,late '80s, '90s.
But we still get these doot-da-doots every once in a while.
"Doot-da-" whats?
Doot-da-doots.
You know-- idiot, moron, knucklehead.
Where you from, jersey?
Forget about that.
We think a kid was surfing the rear car of your train last night.
You sure he came from my train?
Yeah,it had to,because the victim was lying across the tracks, and I was riding the train behind yours when I saw him.
If another train passed, he would've been sliced in half.
It's the risk these kids take?
-Yeah.
-I don't get it.
Mr.White,you're the conductor.
Did you notice anything unusual on that run?
I see "unusual" on every run.
It's a subway.
You want unusual, you're going to find it.
Well,do you remember anybody causing any trouble?
Any doot-da-doots get your attention?
That's very nice.
She used it in a sentence and everything.
Look,I open and close the doors.
I'm all about staying on schedule.
Last night,wasn't different than any other night,nothing special.
That's it.
We're going to take a look at your train.
And do me a favor, in the meantime, if you remember even the littlest thing,
-get in touch.\
-All right.
Look, if you need anythinglse, just call.
They got to pay me overtime every time they change my run.
So I'm always available, if you know what I mean.
All right.
I got blood, and a load of footprints up here.
How you doing?
Typical new york city subway car.
A million fingerprints and a smorgasbord of trace.
woo!
Woo-hoo!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Whoo!
I got evidence of two surfers up here.
And it looks like they both made it down from the roof.
Looks like mac was right, Monroe.
They had him down and back inside the train.
I've got medium velocity blood spatter.
Looks like we may have found our primary crime scene.
All right.Now all we've got to do is find our secondary surfer.
Okay.
Chill out.
At time is...it?
We're looking for perry lohmann, randy william's roommate.
What's happened?
That's what we're here to find out.
Mind if we come in?
Thank you.
Perry lohmann,wake up.
Hey, subway surfer, we've got to talk.
You're a lucky boy.
Can I use the bathroom?
I'm a little hung-over.
Make it quick.
You can have a seat.
I like what you did with the place.
Don't move, don't move, don't move.
What the hell did I do?
Nice collar, monroe.
I already told you.
I ran because I figured I did something wrong.
Sometimes when I drink, I do stupid things.
Things I don't remember.
Yeah,well,you remember how randy williams ended up dead?
I still can't believe he's dead.
I was just with him.
We went partying.
He can't be dead.
Those are some interesting scratches on your back,Perry.
Randy williams had the same scratches.
It must have made you kind of angry that he was sleeping with your girlfriend.
Actually, I'm randy's girlfriend.
Randy and I have been going out since high school.
I didn't want to hurt him.
Perry and I...
It just happened.
So where were you and randy partying?
I don't know.
Lot's of places I guess.
I was trashed.
I only remember bits and pieces.
Start with the bits.
We...we were at some club...
on broadway.
Broadway's the longest street in the world,kiddo.
There were girls dancing.
We had a problem with the bouncer.
That's all I remember.
Well, that narrows idown.
How about some more bits?
You said you had a problem with a bouncer?
We were way out of line.
We pissed him off.
He and randy really got into it.
Hey,watch it,Jerk!
Man, leave him alone!
What the hell?
!
Randy was hot.He wanted another shot at the guy.
We waited outside until the bar closed.
Then you confronted the bouncer?
We followed him into the train station.
They had words-- that's it.
The train came,we got on and went to the back.
You see the bouncer on the train?
Not that I remember.
Look,we were clubbing,got trashed, got stupid headed home,the usual.
I left randy on the train,went to another club and now he's dead.
You remember surfi on the train with randy?
Maybe, I don't know.
We do it sometimes.
We were hammered.
Do you remember killing randy williams and throwing his body on the tracks?
Look,I've got nothing else to say.
You like being punished,Perry?
'Cause that's what we do.
Except we don't tie you to the bed, and spank you with some pledge paddle.
We throw you in jail.
So you won't mind if I borrow this, right?
See if randy williams got a punishment he didn't deserve.
-Hey.
-Hey.
How's our security camera treating us?
Well, I looked at the footage from about an hour before the market opened-- through the trading day.
Not much happening.
Q.T.Jammer's under broker, bobby martin, pouring himself a cup of coffee in reception
Secretary leaves right after the closing bell.
That kind of thing.
Then... this guy comes in...
and he's not happy.
And here's...
where the broken vase comes in.
Did you get a name for our angry guy?
-Name and a location.
-Good.
Mr. Reiter, do you want to put the weights down,please?
When I finish my set.
48...
Mr Reiter,we need to talk to you about the losses you took in the market.
-...50.
-Right now,Mr. Reiter.
Bunny...
What's my money got to do with you?
Q.T. Jammer's dead.
What'd he do, jump out a window?
Now why would you say that?
I'm sure all of his clients took a bath yesterday.
Including me.
Mueller's magic grip.
Athletic adhesive used for rock climbing, discus throwing and look here...
weight lifting
What's all this about?
We know you paid Q.T.Jammer a visit earlier in the day.
And thanks to your powder here, we suspect you had your hands around his neck.
Look, it's not every day you lose $2.4 million in six hours.
So I paid him a visit.
We had a little client-broker heart-to-heart.
Just the two of us.
Look, orange juice is down for a very good reason,Mr.Kartzinel
Farmers are worried about another katrina.
The only thing in the market today is oil, and that's because bush wants 22-inch rims on his golf cart.
You got me in to this market, you better get me out, or I'll pop your head off like a mushroom!
I lost my temper..
and my money.
-And a vase.
-What?
You want me to reimburse him?
I think I could find five bucks.
-Let me get my wallet.
-Yeah, do that.
We're going to need your I.D. To file assault charges.
Give me some good news, adam.
This is the contents of randy williams' stomach.
I found chunks of macadamias, almonds and cashews.
Perfect description of bar mix.
What about the shark's tooth?
I'm still trying to figure out how something like
-that got stuck in his hand
-There you go.
There's tool marks at the top of the tooth,by the roots.
Looks like it was mounted on some type of setting.
Maybe a necklace or a key chain.
No broken chain or setting found at the crime scene, no indication that the tooth belonged to the victim.
Strange case, you know?
Bar nuts, shark tooth, tropical fish.
Betta splenden... or siamese fighting fish, to be exact.
The brilliant colors are exclusive to males-- males in the same tank will kill each other.
Ironic.
No...wild, wild,wet.
Whoa!
That's a very hip, very salacious manhattan club.
That just kind of popped in your head like that?
And your point?
Well, I just... you know, I...
I didn't think that you would... the bar's over on broadway, near chelsea uversity-- fighting fish on every table.
It's a short train ride from where randy williams was found.
Yone the man!
You can hang anywhere you want,huh?
I was at the scene of a crime,adam.
Bouncers went a little overboard, ended up killing some kid from staten island.
Shrimp cocktail is fantastic.
Get meomething more on that tooth.
I like shrimp.
I remember him, yeah.
Two guys.
College kids.
Couldn't hold their liquor.
Come in the other night causing trouble,so I taught 'em a lesson.
What kind of lesson?
They were swallowing live fish, knocking over drinks, causing big problems.
Oh,my god,he's eating the fish.
Hey, what are you doing?
I softened him up a bit.
Enough of a lesson that he won't be coming back anytime soon.
The kid in the picture won't be coming back at all--
He's dead.
Ax handle.
Who does this belong to?
Paul bunyan was in last night.
Heust've left it.
Well,you won't mind if I hang onto it until Mr.Bunyan comes back.
I don't care if you stand in the corner and spit wooden nickels.
I got nothin' to hide.
Looks like blood.
You keeping score on how many heads you bash in?
Put it this way,There ain't a notch on the bat with that kid's name on it.
You better hope not... or you'll be living in an eight-by-ten cell with your name on it.
The "c" in this case does not just stand for "commodities."
-What's it stand for?
-Chloroform.
Tox came back on our vic.
Someone knocked him out and then tossed him out.
So we've got our "how," we just need to find the "who."
Okay, take a look at this.
Minutes after seamus reiter left the building, this man walked into the office, wearing a three-piece suit and-- green handkerchief.
He was wearing it when he walked into the office...
But...
Not when he walked out.
Here's the catch
We can't prove that he went in to Q.T. Jammer's office.
But..
Sign-in at reception has a cecil arthur visiting the floor around that time.
He's a client.
His profits for the day,$840,000.
He's actually one of the few who made money.
Who makes money and kills his broker?
Those commissions can be murder.
-Cecil Arthur?
-Yeah.
This is how we feed the world.
Why don't you stop feeding the world for a minute and come over and talk to us.
I'm giving back to the earth that has given back to me.
N.Y.P.D.The pigeons can go hungry for a minute,okay?
Buddy, you got three seconds to stop doing that before I come in there and get you.
Oh, for the love of caesar.
Eat!
Out of the limo now,I says!
That's how i live my life.
When I lose in the market, I lay in bed and eat fig newtons all day.
if I score, I celebrate by giving back to mother earth.
Mr. Arthur, just answer the question.
Why would I want to harm him?
Q.T. Was my broker,we had a phenomenal day in the market yesterday.
At least I did,anyway.
Not to mention that I am the most important client
-has in his book. \
-His book?
The manifest of clients-- he handles 81 speculators, net worth of $50 million apiece.
I have $700 million with him myself.
Where's your green handkerchief?
You had one when you went into Q.T. Jammer's office.
You came back out without it.
I sneezed.
What's that bulge in your pocket?
And don't get cute.
Circular stain.
Can you explain that?
Turnout mother nature gave something back to me.
They say it's good luck, you know?
We'll find out.
How we making out with the wood sampl, danny?
Not good.
And adam called-- blood from the ax handle doesn't come back to our vic.
Means the bouncer used it on somebody else.
Take a look.
Splinter on the left is from the ax handle, splinter on the right's from our vic's forehead.
Like the frat paddle-- doesn't match.
So the search goes on-- for our murderer and our murder weapon.
What you got there?
Results on the handkerchief.
Negative for chloroform, positive for bird crap.
The shark tooth you guys found is from the great white.
Now, the length and the number of points along the edge of the tooth is used to determine the size and the species of the shark.
This one was around 21 feet long and weighed over 2,500 pounds.
But great whites are migratory fish.
Right?
They're prevalent all up and down the east coast.
Not to mention a bunch of other places.
Which is where my closer look comes in.
Check this out.
See, the enamel on this tooth is worn.
Aren't most shark's teeth that are sold commercially fossils that have lacquer preservative?
This tooth came right from the shark's mouth, so the person who owned it likely caught the fish or knew the person who did.
But that could be in australia, for all we know.
Mm, my friend grateloupia t uruturu would beg to differ.
Brown algae?
A microscopic diatom found in the pulp of the shark's tooth, usually found in cooler waters of the north atlantic-- now, only two sharks of this size have ever been caught on the north atlantic coast,
and the last one was in '92.
If I could get my hands on the list of the fishermen who are involved in the charter boats... maybe a name pops up?
Good job, adam.
Remember that question on the csi training exam?
Look, there are a lot of questions on the training exam, hawkes.
There was a chloroform question about solvents-- you know, leachi versus bleaching.
What's your point?
Okay, I was just looking at your overall photos-- more specifically, this one with the pillows.
Now, we're looking for something green that might've been used to smother him,right?
The pillows on this couch aren't green.
That's my point.
Maybe the pillow used wasn't green.
Chloroform can sometimes act as a solvent when it comes in contact with fabrics.
Leaching can occur and turn certain dyes a different color.
Like turning a blue pillow green.
We can't get a print off a pillow.
Who was the last person to see Q.T.Jammer alive?
Bobby martin.
I've been through this footage a thousand times, and his alibi checks out
See, bobby got a cup of coffee in reception... went to the bathroom for two minutes,
and then walks out of frame.
Okay, and that's when he comes out and calls 9-1-1.
So we can only assume that he went into Q.T.'S office, found him dead and came out to make the call.
And according to him, he went into the bathroom and puked his guts out.
-Can I sit for a second?
-Sure.
I'm gonna rewind the tape for a second.
I've been here for a couple of minutes.
The steam on my tea is still going strong.
He walks into the bathroom with a steaming cup of coffee.
Seconds later, he walks out.
No steam.
He knew he was on camera.
Yeah.
He went into the bathroom, he emptied out his coffee, put the chloroform in the paper cup.
Only I checked that office high and low--
I didn't find any paper cup.
Let's fast-forward the footage.
Came out of Q.T.'S office whithout it.
Probably hid the cup on his person, threw it away in the bathroom when he was supposed to be throwing up.
Exactly.
That's how he got rid of it.
Evidence gone-- taken away by the cleaning crew.
This isn't gonna get taken away by the cleaning crew.
The c exchange by-laws.
From the editor who wrote the times article.
Seems the underbroker told a big fib.
When Q.T. Jammer went out the window,his underbroker, bobby martin, inherited his book.
Okay, so we don't have the paper cup, but we have the motive.
Gentlemen, we have to find that cup.
You get anything else from the splinters, boss?
Yeah.
Antifreeze.
Antifreeze?
You might want to take a look at what lindsay and i pulled from the new york public library.
Yeah?
Tell me on the fly.
What's the rush?
I have a train to catch.
We're gonna take a little ride, Mr White.
We need to talk.
It's a tragedy to all of us, Ms.Chandler, but the market goes on.
By sunrise, we'll be open for business, and I'd be honored to make you a killing.
And I'd be honored to bust you for a killing.
Hang up the phone, bobby.
Bobby, what's going on?
You look good in this office, bobby.
You look like you'd kill to be here.
You murdered Q.T. Jammer.
We pulled your print off the paper cup.
Sec demands that all its brokers get printed hen they receive their series 7 license.
Your name just popped up like that.
What it didn't say was whether you take chloroform with your coffee or not.
We also found this.
"C" exchange by-laws.
You stood to inherit his book.
Q.T.Jammer was the senior partner.
You were the underbroker.
You knew staging his death as a suicide would enable you to get your hands on all of his clients.
We lost $17 million that day, and I did the impossible--
I made cecil arthur money.
-Tough day, huh, Q.T.?
-Chernobyl.
It's a good thing cecil arthur took my advice.
He made a killing on those oil contracts.
What are you, an authority?
You make one right trade, and all of a sudden you're an expert?
Get the hell out of my office!
Get fetch me my coffee, cold caller.
Q.T.Jammer's got a short memory, and like every other mega-millionaire egomaniac, he thinks he's the genius.
You bring $700 million into a commodities firm, you get made partner-- not here.
After three years, I was gonna get mine one way or the other.
so what, you were gonna party making millions, is that it?
you think this is about the money?
This is not about the money.
It's about the book.
Because, you see, life is about being at the right place at the right time for the right reason.
Winninand losing fortunes with a single touch of a button!
Now, if that's not living, nothing is!
That's not living, it's called gambling, and you just ran out of luck, pal.
Put your hands behind your back.
Market's closed.
Let's go.
This better be good,detective.
Train master's not gonna be happy that I was pled from my run and the trains were delayed again.
Eh, you let me worry about that.
You ever heard of ethylene glycol?
I can't say that I have.
It's an antifreeze used on the electrified third rail.
Keeps it from freezing in the winter.
Well, that's very interesting.
What does it have to do with me?
Well, some of the splinters taken from the victim's head wound were saturated with ethylene glycol.
Yeah, so?
Your shoe paddle is used to separate the contact shoe from the train from the electrified third rail.
Over time, the wood absorbs the ethylene glycol.
Yeah, well, there's a ton of shoe paddles in the system.
Every conductor has one.
Not all of them test positive for blood.
You're gonna have to do better than that, detective, or we're done here.
We're done when I say we're done.
Stand up.
Lift your jacket.
So I like fishing.
What the hell's this got to do with anything?
It means that the shark's tooth missing from the setting on your key chain here was found embedded in randy williams' hand.
That tooth came from that shark.
Your train was running late that night.
Reports were filed to explain the delays.
Randy williams and his roommate were slowing you down.
Okay, I ain't gonna tell you punks again.
If I got to stop the train one more time for you dirt bags,
I'm gonna come back here, and I'm gonna hurt somebody.
You ain't gonna do nothin'!
Get back in your choo-choo box.
these kids nowadays, they got no respect.
Every man has a breaking point.
Get off the door.
Last chance, randy.
One more drink?
You go ahead, man-- I'm done.
Get out of here.
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
You ever had anybody spit in your face, detective?
I have been hit with soda bottles, cans,called every name in the book, but nobody's ever gonna spit in my face.
You deserve it,cap'n crunch.
You're just a two-bit conductor.
So somehow, beating a drunk and vulnerable kid to death and throwing him out the back of a train makes it right?
I make $43,000 a year to keep this thing moving.
People depend on me and these trains for their livelihood.
But who's got my back?
Who cares about me, the working man?
I did...until you broke the law.
Yeah, mac, I'm on the train now.
I'probably gonna lose you.
I'm doing a 4:00-to- 12:00 tomorrow--I'll see you then.
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go straight home,
I'm not finding any bodies.
Trust me.
Yeah,yeah,yeah.All right, you too.All right.
Oh, get out of here.
Hey, how you doing?
It hurts,man!
I know,I know.
It hurts!
I know.
You're almost there,man!
Don't worry,you'll be fine!
That other dude,did I get him?
Smoke that fool?
Man,the cops will tell you about it
Duane Harris,16.
GSW to the left leg BP 120 over 70
Heart rate tachy 160
One liter of saline
Let's get him into Trauma 2
I'll leave my report with the duty nurse
Nice work out there,partner
Yeah,you,too
You know I hate to write it
You gonna clean the bus?
Yeah
All right
Danny
Jack, I'm so sorry about your father
What are you doing?
I'm sorry
I'm sorry, Jack
-Thanks for the, uh...
-The deluxe fruit basket
Yeah, thanks for the fruit basket
-You really didn't have to do anything.
-No, no, no.
I did it
-I wanted to pay my respects and...
-What do we got going here?
A paramedic went missing in the middle of his shift last night
His name's Cole Warren His partner called it in
How long were you outside cleaning the ambulance?
No more than 30 minutes
I had to run back.
Came to tell Cole we had another call, I couldn't find him
And he didn't leave word with anyone?
He didn't even finish his paperwork
I called his apartment, his cell and his girlfriend
She's a surgical intern upstairs
How about the last call you responded to, what happened there?
It was a shoot-out between a couple of gangbangers
Two of them in the Lenox crew
Two of them survived.
Lenox died at the scene
Has he ever taken off like this before?
Nah, he's 100 percent reliable
Even when he's not working, he's working
Checks up on people after release, springs for cab fare so relatives can follow
There's no way he would just go AWOL
With Out A Trace Season 4 Episode 11
When was the last time you talked to Cole?
Yesterday morning
He spent the night at my place, and then we took the subway in together
Was that your usual routine?
Mm-hmm, three,four times a week
Do you think that Cole's disappearance
Could be... his way of taking a break from your relationship?
No way
You know the kind of guy you always dream about?
Responsible, really listens and good-looking?
Yeah
That's Cole
So, everything was perfect?
We had had this plan for a while about moving out of the city
And then two weeks ago, something happened
Because I don't know where he changed his mind
So, what, chicken and waffles at Susie's?
You want me to bust out of my scrubs?
Girl, as long as I'm doing the busting
Well, Susie's is always appealing, but...
Mm-hmm, but?
Did you forget?
Forget what?
The condo
We're supposed to go up there tonight
Oh yeah, this place we were looking up in Roc
Mm-hmm.
The broker called
One bedroom is available
I put a binder down
Baby, I thought we were just looking
Yeah, but you know how fast they go
I told him we'd come up there and give him our checks for the rest of the deposit
What is with that face?
Nothing
Look, we've been talking about this for months
Yeah, I know.
Well, I don't have my share of the money
-You said you had it!
-I know, but now I don't
I'm sorry
I got to go
You're not on call
Baby, look
I just gotta take care of something, all right?
I love you.
I'll talk to you later
He went downstairs to his locker, grabbed his paramedic bag and left
Why'd he take the bag?
I don't know
When I asked him where he went, he didn't say
All right, what about the condo?
How much money are we talking about?
$ 8,000
Do you think he really didn't have it?
Cole was born and raised in Harlem
He lived here his whole life, except for when he was in the Army
I figure he just had cold feet about moving
Right
Okay, remind me of Cole's personnel file, if I ever get cocky
Why?
Paramedic of the Year, four citations for valor performance evaluations that sound like his mother wrote it
All at Harlem?
Yeah.
He's had several opportunities to transfer.
Refused them all
Oh, and did I mention he attends church regularly at the Living Brotherhood Ministry?
Boy from the hood does good
Yo, Viv, check this out
He's withdrawn $12,000 in the last couple weeks
Yeah, well, that might explain why he didn't have the money for the condo
Yeah, but it doesn't explain why he needed the money
Could be drugs
It says here that his mother died of a drug overdose
Family history can be a bitch
Thanks
You understand our deal, right?
Yeah.
I talk to y'all in private at your spot and so long as I didn't do nothing to that paramedic stuff here doesn't connect to my other charges
Exactly
So you were with Cole Warren the night of your transport to the hospital?
The black dude.
Yeah
And, uh, the white guy was driving
What about at the scene?
Who else was there besides the kid you faxed to the morgue?
Yo, them murder charges is bogus
I don't know who shot that fool
Right
So it was just you and Cole on that side of the street?
Nah, nah.
There was this other dude, came out of nowhere talking crazy, trying to crump me
He shot me.
I can't believe he shot me
Ok, ok, listen.
You got to be quiet ,man.
The more you talk, the more blood you're gonna pump out.
All right?
Hey listen, listen.
Hold still
I'm trying to keep pressure on this
-Look at me.
- Am I gonna die?
-Nah, man, you're not gonna die.
-Hey, what are you doing?
You're saving him?
Huh?
He's a damn murderer!
Let him die!
Okay, man, look, you need to step back, okay?
-Bleed out, son of a...
-Hey, hey!
Go home!
Now, this guy that was trying to crump you, did you know him?
Never seen him before
I figure he just some punk-ass fool from Lenox trying to gain position on a warrior like myself
You know, being incapacitated and all that
Do you think you could use that warrior-like mind of yours to describe him?
I owe your boy a solid for saving my life so...
Yeah, I can remember him
In that neighborhood, this can't be the first time he pissed somebody off because he saved the wrong guy's life
Okay, well, let's cover the gang angle and look at the old paramedic files
And call the NYPD Gang Division.
See if they can help us
Okay
-Hi
-Hi
There's a change
I didn't know where to send them.
So, I thought I'd bring them here
Beautiful
Thank you
How are you doing?
Good, you know.
Got a pulse
You?
Some good days, some bad
Random outbursts help
Then I'm doing great, 'cause I've had about ten meltdowns with the V.A. trying to arrange my father's funeral
Well, after Max's, I'm a bit of an expert.
So, if you need help
Got any pull with a bugler?
You know, the military, they promise you one thing, and then the next thing you know you have to choose between a tape recording of taps and some guy holding a digital horn.
I think playing taps is out of my league, sorry
You know, I'd really like you to come
Of course
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just let me know
I will
I've got a 10:00
Thanks for coming in.
Sure
Call if you need anything
-I will, thank you
-Okay
You getting anything off Cole's old reports?
Yeah, that being a paramedic in that neighbourhood is hell
Stabbings, shootings, a dozen DOA's a week
Do you know the guy that Duane said tried to attack him?
-Yeah
-He's not a gang member
Well, then what was his beef with Duane?
Well, there was another gang shooting on that block a week ago and one of the bullets killed his daughter
Mr. Burnett, we are very sorry for your loss
Very sorry
She was watching TV
And she's dead... because I couldn't afford for her to have a safe place to live
No, it's not your fault, Mr. Burnett
It's those gangbangers running around out there with guns
Or the paramedic who saves them
When I heard those shots again
I just lost it
I wanted somebody to pay for Angela's death!
We know you went to the hospital 'cause we saw you on the security camera
What were you doing there?
I thought that I could give the police a report
See if the shootings connected up to Angela
But I didn't see him
Well, this is the paramedic that you fought with that night
Did you see him later?
Yeah
I was outside the E.R.
I went straight to my shift at the warehouse
You can check
Could you see what was handed to him?
No
It rolled, but I didn't see it
So the hospital's security cameras angle towards the intake ramp
From this camera all you get is Cole leaving the E.R.
But this is from the parking lot across the street
I got your guy right here
All right can you get me a POV for the guy inside the car?
Good.
Make a picture of that.
I want to circulate it
Right.
Done
Is there any way we can see what he's handing off to Cole?
Not from this angle, but... there's a second camera on the lot.
I think...
That's a lot of dough
Maybe Cole takes money from the Tombs in exchange for top service then he lets the Lennox Crew bleed out
Yeah, but on the tape he didn't even look as if he wanted to take the money
Maybe he said no and that's why he's in trouble
Listen to this.
The guy driving the car is Orlando Davidson
Drug trafficking and assault
And guess who he used to run with as a teenager?
-Oh, Cole was a gangbanger?
-Yes
How'd you find that out?
Well his juvenile records are sealed, but a cop friend of mine hooked me up
So, have we gotten hold of this Orlando?
No
He's gonna be hard to track
What was the name of the church that Cole attends?
Living Brotherhood Ministry
Okay, well, six months ago
Cole gave $1,000 to an anti-gang program they run
Why not just tell his girlfriend that's where some of the money went?
Because he never told his girlfriend about his gang past
I started the program seven years ago after my son was shot walking home from school
I'm sorry about that, Reverend
There are a lot of people who lost loved ones
I'm fortunate to have this as an outlet for the pain
I understand that Cole helped you fund your work?
He gave more than money; he gave his time
Men with jobs in this neighbourhood gleam like gold
He's been a great role model
Did he ever tell you he used to run with the Tombs as a teenager?
He didn't like to talk about it much, but..
yes, he confided in me
You think there's a possibility that he could've gone back to that life?
Absolutely not!
If anything, it was just the opposite
Good rhythm
Look at you, Trevor
You got a natural gift for this, man
You really think you could save somebody's life doing this?
A two-year-old in a bathtub just last week
Oh, how'd that feel?
Oh, man, that felt great
Keep doing it, man.
You're looking great
What's up, man?
What's up, Cole?
Chillin', cuz.
You know, I'm doin' my thing
You really think any of these fools is gonna Lazarus somebody?
Well... as you can see, some are catching on
Look, man, I was just wondering if you could just chill on that for a minute?
Look, it's hard for chest compressions to compete with a cell phone.
You know what I'm saying?
You starting to make getting in my face a habit
You telling me to leave?
No... no, man
I'm just asking for a little space for these boys.
That's all
Yeah, a'ight
Show 'em your stuff
Appreciate it
Catch up with you later, homes
Fo' sure
Cole was seen with Orlando Davidson last night right before he went missing
We think there's a possibility that they're working together
I don't believe that
Okay, do you know where I can find Orlando?
Somewhere out there on the street
That's all I can tell you
Thank you
Oh, boy
Remember that page Cole's girlfriend told us about?
Yeah
Okay, I just got his pager records
Someone called him from a pay phone at a convenience store in the middle of Tombs territory and sent him a message
But it's just four numbers triple six, four
So I'm thinking maybe some kind of a gang code
Or slang?
I tell you what.
I'll take the gang files, if you'll take the slang
It's an addendum to a will
So, it's just witnesses, attestation clause...it all looks kosher
Yeah, but he made this decision the day his doctor told him he had kidney failure
Now his lawyer's telling me that this is legal and binding
But it doesn't affect the rest of the will.
It's just the funeral
What funeral?
I'm gonna torch him and put him in a jar?
You know, he did have Alzheimer's.
You could find a judge who might rule diminished capacity
Old bastard, he just did this to torture me
Well, it's working
-I just want what's right.
-For whom?
Why do you always do this?
Do what?
Make an easy answer complicated
I'm a lawyer?
Goes with the training?
Would you knock it off?
There you go
There you have it
I'll do this
-I'll get back to you
-Okay
-Viv
-Hmm
-I need your help
- Okay
I have gone through all of the gang members in this neighborhood, okay
I've gone through birthdays, prison numbers, apartment numbers...
None of them match
I mean, what am I missing here?
You know because if it's just some random personal code, then we're completely lost
Okay, all right.
Now, what about...
letters?
-For example, six would be M-N-O
-M,N and O
What about... all right, we got a Mike here who's listed as a member of the Tombs
All right so that would be six, four...
Nope, not six, four
What about a Nathan?
Six-two
Nope, okay, what about a Monique
Okay, six-six-six.
Yep, that's it
Six-six-six-four
Monique, we know that you paged Cole two weeks ago
Triple-six-four spells out the beginning of your name
A lot of names start like that
Yeah, but you're the one that was identified by the clerk at the convenience store, Monique
He remembers you making the call because you cursed him out for not giving you a free cigarette
They charged a buck fifty for a loosey!
So... so you were there?
And you did page Cole
Ain't no law against that
You have a beef with Cole, hmm... a fight that you want to take to the next level, Monique?
I didn't do nothing to him
No, well, did somebody get shot and that's why you were calling Cole?
So he could come over and patch them up?
It was a ten-ten
Who got jumped in?
My boyfriend, Trevor
He got beat bad
I didn't know who else to call
I'm glad you paged me
Trevor... hey, look at me
Man, go away
Nobody told you to come here
Yeah, well, you let ten fools beat on you for ten minutes
Now you're in a gang
Took it like a man
Nobody got over on me
Yeah, but you're smarter than this, Trevor
This beat down alone could've killed you
Man, there's a lot of ways out here to die
What are you doing?
Trevor, we were working this, man
Why would you come out of the plan now?
Talk to me
I was just playing hoops
Stole the ball from this guy and he tripped
I laughed, you know, just messing
Didn't know he was Lenox Crew
He swore he'd kill me
Orlando told me if I joined, the Tombs could protect me
Hey, look at me, man
I got a job, Trevor
All right?
I'm not packing weed
I'm not running guns for Orlando so he could get a nice new ride
It can happen
Out here?
On 115th?
Nah, nah
I need an insurance policy and you can't be it
Yo, Trev
No, no
No, don't do this
I ain't got no choice
Do you know where Trevor is now?
No
I haven't heard from him since yesterday
His mother is out of town on a job
I have a key to his place
I could give it to you
Apartment is clear
Told you Trevor wasn't here
I mean, you could've found that out without dragging me
Okay, is he your boyfriend?
-Is he?
-Yeah
Because we thought that you'd want to help us find him
And I understand that you're just trying to stay out of trouble, but listen
Keeping quiet is not gonna help
Monique, we know that you didn't give us the keys to the apartment because you like doing favors for the FBI
Did you think we were gonna find a body here?
Not telling us what you know about a murder or a kidnapping makes you an accessory which means that you're gonna go to jail for a very long time
It doesn't matter that you're 14 years old.
Do you understand that?
So
-you want to start over?
-Okay
Cole was here last night
He was looking for Trevor
I gave you $10,000, Lando.Why not just take it?
'Cause I changed my mind
Li'l' homie gonna make a real good soldier
Don't let his cartoon-watching ass fool you
Look, come on, man
I told you what his teacher said
The only time I've heard the word "potential" used so many times is when they were talking about your skinny ass
Now look, man, I'm asking you as a favor for old times sake, don't do this
Man, why you keep plucking at them old memory strings?
Waking and baking, yeah,it was cool
Yeah, we were like brothers, man
And that's the word you keep forgetting: "were."
Why do I owe you anything?
You jump off and now you come strutting back?
Everybody all looking up at you with your fancy equipment
Well, Trevor, that's my equipment
So you need to step off
I can't do that
Look, Trevor has a chance
Let him take it
How does that feel, huh?
Your fancy training gonna save you now?
Hey, Trevor
Li'l man!
Cole here wants to rescue you
You wanna be alone?
Fly free on the streets?
-Trevor, don't listen to him
-Shut up!
Huh?
No
Then hold this for me
Gotta go
Now, show me what you made of, li'l man
That was it
Orlando left
Trevor told me to go, too
And you haven't heard from Trevor since?
Nah, I was hoping you guys could find him before he did something stupid
What do you think happened to Cole?
You know
I'm sorry we had to pick you up at your baby momma's house
Next time don't hide behind your lady's skirt, okay, Orlando?
Didn't know y'all was looking for me
Well, we were
Where the hell is Cole?
I don't know what you're talking about
We know you were at Trevor's apartment last night
Who'd y'all talk to?
Crackhead-ho, Monique?
She hallucinates
We didn't find crackhead-ho Monique
Now, what we did find was a lot of people that were very excited about helping us move you to a federal address
You know, I think you put your boy Trevor up to killing Cole
What?
You ain't got nothing to say about that?
What you think?
Well, if you have nothing to say then you're free to go
Because we don't need you
Come on, go
What?
Trevor's 14 years old
How far do you think a 14-year-old with a dead body's gonna get?
That was good-- covering for Monique
Thanks
I wanna tell you something.I don't think we should put this guy back on the street
Listen, NYPD's gonna trail him
We're good
I'm telling you
We're good
Hello
Hi
I got your message, obviously
Thanks for coming
Yeah, no problem
Can I get you something?
Uh, yeah
It's just water
Ooh.
Um, vodka tonic, please
Thanks
It's a little early in the day for that, don't you think?
Hmm, well, you did invite me to a bar
Good point
I probably should've ordered one myself
So ,have you thought about your father?
Well, I'm torn
Between honoring the last wishes of a crazy, old man or giving him the final flying finger
I know, it's stupid
I did look into it
And, uh, you can overturn his decision if you want
Really?
But I wouldn't recommend it, Jack
Why not?
Your dad's dead, Jack
You have to let go
Yeah, well, I will certainly take that under advisement
You know what?
I want to, um...
I want to apologize for this morning
-Oh, yeah
-I was so out of line
I have no idea what came over me
I just, look, I don't even think of you that way
You know what?
That did not come out the way I wanted it to come out.
I'm sorry
I understand
You know what I mean.
I just...
Hang on a second.
Sorry
Yeah
Uh-huh
Okay
Gotta go
Yep, I, uh...
I have to go
And, uh...
I'm really sorry about, uh, what happened and... it was really inappropriate... for me to do that
And now it's over
Really?
-You know we could talk about...
-No
It doesn't matter.
Okay
So, we're good?
We are
Has Orlando called Trevor?
Yeah, he made three calls in a row to the same number the second he left the building
He's worried about where the kid dumped the body
All right, guys.
I got the number he called
I'm just triangulating the location from this signal
-All right, I got it
-Where is he?
Uh, the signal's coming from Edgecomb Hospital.
That's where Cole went missing
One of the boys in the church.
Yeah sure I recognize him
Cole brought him on a run with us once
Seemed like a bright kid, but I haven't seen him since
What time did you go back on duty?
About a half hour ago
Just getting the equipment ready for the next run
What's up?
I left the door to the bus open.
Now it's closed
Where's Cole?
Hey, man, I don't know, dawg.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Come on out
Easy
You were the last person to see Cole alive and I know Orlando told you to kill him
You help us, we'll help you
Aw, man, I swear
I didn't do nothing.
I didn't kill Cole
Move out.
Let's go!
You really think that's gonna keep my blood from splattering?
You, shut up!
I gotta think
Right.
Right
Think
But not about how you're gonna clean up this mess from shooting me but how your life will never be the same if you do this
Yo, I said shut up!
You're not a killer, Trevor
What do you know about me?
Well, I know a killer would've shot me already, been at the refrigerator looking for something to eat
-I'm warning you
-I know a killer... wouldn't spend time over a dummy practicing to save a life
What the hell do you know?
You got out.
Never made your bone
Yeah, I did
I thought killing someone would make me a man, too
We do this thing, man, we in.
Solid gold, homes
Tombs forever
So, how 'bout him?
Orders are civilian male
Show him no mercy
He it then
I killed him
And all he was doing was walking home from school
Yo, Orlando already told that story with him doing the shooting
I know.
I let him
Because the only story I had to tell was how I puked every night
And how I couldn't get his face out of my head
And how I could hear his family crying no matter where I was
Come on, Cole.
Turn around
Why?
If you shoot me you will see my face every night for the rest of your life whether I turn around or not
So, go ahead, man
Make your bone
What if I want to get out?
How can I?
Orlando will kill us both
You let me worry about that
Let go
Let go
It's okay, man
It's okay, man
Cole came up with a plan-- a school I could go to, live there
Get out that neighbourhood
He was going to pay for the first year
Where is he now?
I don't know
He told me to come here
Ask y'all for his key to his place in Tarrytown then go there and wait
And de didn't say where he was going?
He said he had to go see somebody
Stay put.
Watch him
So we were both right.
This guy's a killer
Who turned his life around
I just hope it's not too late, Viv
Okay, bad news
-You know the tail on Orlando?
-Mm-hmm
NYPD lost him
Okay, I checked the records on unsolved murders in Harlem from eight years ago
The young man who Cole killed, I think this is him
Reverend Hovis' son
Reverend please you need to talk to us
So where's Cole?
Where is he?
I don't know
I'm going to ask you one more time
Where is Cole?
He came by
I wish he hadn't
Cole, what's going on?
The FBI was just here
One of the boys told me Orlando's trying to hurt you
I know.
I crossed him, so..
now he wants to kill me
Should I call the police?
No.
Orlando doesn't matter
Reverend, I came here today because, um... if something does happen to me, I need you to know that, uh...
Know what, son?
-Don't call me that, okay?
-Okay, okay
Calm down, Cole
Believe me, I've heard the worst of what's in men's souls
-Anything I...
-I killed your son
What?
I shot Miles
I'm the one that killed him
No
Look, I came to his funeral and I don't even know why
But when I heard you preach it just changed me
After that, I swore that I would try
-and make up...
-Make up?
!
Make up?
!
You think by stitching up those hoodlums makes up for kill my boy?
!
-No, no, no, that's not what I meant
-Get out of my face!
Get out!
Reverend, look, I don't...
I don't expect your forgiveness
I got to go.
I got to catch a bus
That's the address of where I'll be
Whatever you need to do
That was it.
He left
I know I should have called you
What was the address?
Some place in Tarrytown
And nothing happened after Cole left?
No
Your Bible got knocked over
Why didn't you pick it up?
Hmm?
You know, I've been going to church my whole life and on a normal day there isn't a holy man alive who'd leave his Bible on the floor
Here take your Bible
Take it.
Take it
What did you do to Cole?
I gave Orlando the address
How long ago was this?
About an hour ago
All right, there's the bus.
He must have gotten in early
And there's Cole and Orlando
Let's go
He's got a gun
Get out of here.
Get out, get out, get out
We were best friends, man
We were.
Come on
Drop the gun!
FBI!
Everybody move clear!
Did you find Trevor?
Everybody's okay
Orlando, put the weapon down
No one needs to get hurt
Come on, Orlando
It doesn't have to go down like this, cuz
Drop the weapon, Orlando
Blood out, cuz
This is Agent Delgado.
I need an ambulance, please.
Now
You're gonna be all right
Is Tre... is Trevor okay?
Trevor's fine
Don't talk.
Shh
I...
I...
I... made by his form... at his school, okay?
Cole, shh
Tell him the money, the money...
Trevor
Are you excited about your new school?
No
Well, you should be
This is a big opportunity for you
Did Cole give this to you?
You wanna make him proud of you, don't you?
Well, here's your shot to do that, so don't blow it
Office.
Cell
Whatever you need, you call me day or night
Nobody makes it alone, Trevor
Nobody
Hi
Hi
Ah
He looks good
You don't think so?
Yeah
He will like that
Thank you
Hope you're happy
- It hurts, man.
It hurts.
- I know, I know.
You're almost there, man.
You'll be fine.
I owe that other dude.
Did I get him?
- Smoke that fool?
- The cops will tell you.
Duane Harris, 16, GSW to the left leg.
BP, 120l70.
Heart rate, tachy-160.
- Fluids?
- One liter saline.
Let's get him into Trauma 2.
I'll leave my report with the duty nurse.
- Nice work out there, partner.
- Yeah, you too.
You know I hate to write.
- You gonna clean the bus?
- Yeah.
All right.
Danny.
Jack, I am so sorry about your father.
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry about your...
I'm sorry, Jack.
- Thanks for the...
- The deluxe fruit basket.
Yeah, thanks for the fruit basket.
You didn't have to do...
No, no, no, I did.
I wanted to pay my respects and...
What do we got going here?
A paramedic went missing in the middle of his shift.
His name's Cole Warren.
His partner called it in.
How long were you cleaning the ambulance?
No more than 30 minutes.
I came to tell Cole we had another call.
I couldn't find him.
- And he didn't leave word with anyone?
- He didn't even finish his paperwork.
I called his apartment, his cell and his girlfriend.
She's a surgical intern.
How about the last call you responded to, what happened?
It was a shootout between gangbangers.
Tomb and a Lenox Crew.
Tomb survived, Lenox died.
- Has he ever taken off like this before?
- No.
He's a hundred percent reliable.
Even when he's not working, he's working.
Checks up on people after release, springs for fares so relatives can follow.
There's no way he would just go AWOL.
When was the last time you talked to Cole?
Yesterday morning.
He spent the night at my place and then we took the subway in together.
- Was that your usual routine?
- Three, four times a week.
Do you think that Cole's disappearance could be his way of taking a break from your relationship?
No way.
You know the kind of guy you always dream about?
Responsible, really listens and good-looking?
Yeah.
- That's Cole.
- So everything was perfect?
We had had this plan for a while about moving out of the city.
And then two weeks ago, something happened.
Because out of nowhere, he changed his mind.
So, what, chicken and waffles at Suzy's?
- You want me to bust out of my scrubs?
- Girl, as long as I'm doing the busting.
- Well, Suzy's is always appealing, but...
- But?
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?
The condo.
We're supposed to go up there tonight.
Oh, yeah, this place we looked at in Rye.
Broker called.
One bedroom is available.
I put a binder down.
- Baby, I thought we were just looking.
- Yeah, but you know how fast they go.
I told them we'd come up there and give our checks for the rest of the deposit.
- What is with that face?
- Nothing.
Look, we've been talking about this for months.
Yeah, well, I don't have my share of the money.
- You said you had it.
- I know, but now I don't.
I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
You're not on call.
Baby, look, I just gotta take care of something, all right?
I love you.
I'll talk to you later.
He went downstairs to his locker, grabbed his paramedic bag and left.
- Why'd he take the bag?
- I don't know.
I mean, I asked him where he went, he didn't say.
All right, what about the condo, how much money are we talking about?
- Eight thousand dollars.
- Do you think he really didn't have it?
Look, Cole was born and raised in Harlem.
He lived here his whole life, except for when he was in the Army.
I figure he just had cold feet about moving.
Right.
Okay, remind me of Cole's personnel file if I ever get cocky.
- Why?
- Paramedic of the Year four citations for valor, evaluations that sound like his mother wrote it.
- All in Harlem?
- Yeah.
He's had several opportunities to transfer, refused them all.
Oh, and did I mention he attends church regularly at the Living Brotherhood Ministry?
Boy from the 'hood does good.
Yo, Viv, check this out.
He's withdrawn $ 12,000 in the last couple weeks.
That might explain why he didn't have money for the condo.
Yeah, but it doesn't explain why he needed the money.
Could be drugs.
It says here that his mother died of a drug overdose.
Well, family history can be a bitch.
- Thanks.
- Yep.
You understand our deal, right?
Yeah.
I talk to y'all in private, and as long as I didn't do nothing to that paramedic, stuff here doesn't connect to my charges.
Exactly.
So you were with Cole the night of your transport to the hospital?
The black dude, yeah.
And the white guy was driving.
Who else was there besides the kid you faxed to the morgue?
Yo, the murder charge is bogus.
I don't know who shot that fool.
Right.
So it was just you and Cole on that side of the street.
No, there was this other dude came out of nowhere talking crazy, trying to crump me.
He shot me.
I can't believe he shot me.
Okay, be quiet.
The more you talk, the more blood you gonna pump out.
Listen, hold still, I'm trying to keep pressure on this.
- Look at me.
- Am I gonna die?
- No, you're not gonna die.
- Hey.
What are you doing, you saving him?
- He's a damn murderer.
Let him die.
- Look, you need to step back, okay?
- Bleed out, son of a...
- Hey, hey, hey.
Go home.
Now, this guy that was trying to crump you, did you know him?
Never seen him before.
I figure he's just some punk-ass fool from Lenox trying to gain position on a warrior like myself, being incapacitated and all.
Do you think you could use that warrior-like mind to describe him?
I owe your boy a solid for saving my life, so, yeah, I can remember him.
Look, this can't be the first time he pissed somebody off because he saved the wrong guy's life.
Let's cover the gang angle.
Look at the paramedic files.
Call the N.Y.P.D. Gang Division, see if they can help.
Okay.
- Hi.
- Hi.
There's a change.
I didn't know where to send them so I thought I'd bring them here.
Beautiful.
Thank you.
How are you doing?
Good, you know?
Got a pulse.
You?
Some good days, some bad.
Random outbursts help.
Then I'm doing great, because I've had 10 meltdowns with the VA trying to arrange my father's funeral.
Oh, well, after Max's, I'm a bit of an expert, so if you need help...
Got any pull with a bugler?
The military promise you one thing and then next, you have to choose between a tape recording of "Taps" and some guy holding a digital horn.
I think playing "Taps" is out of my league, sorry.
You know, I'd really like you to come.
Of course.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just let me know.
- I will.
- I've got a 10:00.
- Okay.
Thanks for coming in.
- Sure.
Call if you need anything.
- I will.
Thank you.
Okay.
You getting anything off Cole's old reports?
Yeah, that being a paramedic in that neighborhood is hell.
Stabbings, shootings, a dozen DOAs a week.
You know the guy that Duane said tried to attack him?
- Yeah.
- He's not a gang member.
Then what was his beef with Duane?
There was another gang shooting on that block a week ago and one of the bullets killed his daughter.
Mr. Burnett, we are very sorry for your loss.
Very sorry.
She was watching TV.
And she's dead because I couldn't afford for her to have a safe place to live.
No, it's not your fault, Mr. Burnett.
It's those gangbangers running around with guns.
Or the paramedic who saves them.
When I heard those shots again I just lost it.
I wanted somebody to pay for Angela's death.
We know you went to the hospital.
We saw you on the security camera.
What were you doing there?
I thought that I could give the police a report.
See if the shootings connected up to Angela.
But I didn't see them.
Well, this is the paramedic that you fought with that night.
- Did you see him later?
- Yeah.
I was outside the ER.
No, no, no.
I went straight to my shift at the warehouse.
You can check.
- Could you see what was handed to him?
- No.
It rolled, but I didn't see it.
The hospital security camera is angled towards the intake ramp.
From this camera, all you get is Cole leaving the ER.
But this is from the parking lot across the street.
I got your guy right here.
Can you get me a pop of the guy inside the car?
Good.
Make a picture of that.
- I wanna circulate it.
- Right, done.
Is there any way we can see what he's handing off to Cole?
Not from this angle, but there's a second camera in the lot.
I think...
That's a lot of dough.
What the hell is Cole doing taking money from a gangbanger?
Maybe Cole takes money from the Tombs for top service and he lets the Lenox Crew bleed out.
But he didn't even look as if he wanted to take the money.
Maybe he said no, and that's why he's in trouble.
Listen to this.
The guy driving the car is Orlando Davidson.
Drug trafficking and assault.
He's a Crew boss.
One of the leaders of the Tombs.
And guess who he used to run with as teenager?
- Cole was a gangbanger?
- Yes.
How'd you find out?
Well, his juvenile records are sealed, but a cop friend of mine hooked me up.
So have we gotten hold of this Orlando?
No.
He's gonna be hard to track.
Viv, what was the name of the church that Cole attends?
- Living Brotherhood Ministry.
- Okay, well, six months ago Cole gave a thousand dollars to an anti-gang program they run.
Why not tell his girlfriend that's where the money went?
Because he never told his girlfriend about his gang past.
I started the program seven years ago:
...after my son was shot walking home from school.
I'm sorry about that, Reverend.
A lot of people lost loved ones.
I'm fortunate to have this as an outlet for the pain.
I understand that Cole helped you fund your work?
He gave more than money.
He gave his time.
Men with jobs in this neighborhood gleam like gold.
He's been a great role model.
Did he tell you that he used to run with the Tombs?
He didn't like to talk about it much, but, yes, he confided in me.
You think he could have gone back to that life?
Absolutely not.
If anything, it was just the opposite.
Good rhythm.
Look at you, Trevor.
You got a natural gift for this, man.
Hey, you really think you can save somebody's life doing this?
Two-year-old in a bathtub just last week.
- How that feel?
- Oh, man, that felt great.
- Hands up.
- Yo, Lando.
Don't forget, y'all, I'm hooking y'all homies up.
I keep you laced.
Keep doing it, man.
You're looking great.
- What's up, man?
- What up, Cole?
Chilling, coz, you know, I'm doing my thing.
You really think any of these fools is gonna Lazarus somebody?
Well, as you can see, some are catching on.
Look, I was wondering if you could just chill on that for a minute.
It's hard for chest compressors to compete with a phone.
You're starting to make getting in my face a habit.
- You're telling me to leave.
- No.
No, man, I'm just asking for a little space for these boys, that's all.
Yeah, all right.
Show them your stuff.
- Appreciate it.
- I'll catch up with you later, homes.
For sure.
Cole was seen with Orlando last night right before he went missing.
There's a possibility that they're working together.
I don't believe that.
Do you know where I could find Orlando?
Somewhere out there on the street.
That's all I can tell you.
Thank you.
Remember that page Cole's girlfriend told us about?
- Yeah.
- Okay, I just got his pager records.
Someone called him from a payphone at a store in the middle of Tombs' territory and sent a message.
But it's just four numbers.
Triple-six four.
So I'm thinking maybe some kind of a gang code.
Or slang?
I'll tell you what, I'll take the gang files if you'll take the slang.
It's an addendum to the will.
So it's just witnesses, attestation clause, it all looks kosher.
He made this decision the day his doctor told him he had kidney failure.
His lawyer's telling me this is legally binding.
Well, it is, but it doesn't affect the will, it's the funeral.
What funeral?
I'm gonna torch him and put him in a jar.
He did have Alzheimer's.
You could find a judge who might rule diminished capacity.
- Bastard just did this to torture me.
- Well, it's working.
- Well, I just want what's right.
- For whom?
- Why do you always do this?
- Do what?
Make an easy answer complicated.
I'm a lawyer.
It goes with the training.
Could you knock it off?
Well.
There you go.
There you have it.
I'll do this.
- I'll get back to you.
- Okay, good.
Viv.
- I need your help.
- Okay.
I have gone through all of the gang members in this neighborhood.
I've gone through birthdays, prison numbers, apartment numbers.
None of them match.
I mean, I...
What am I missing here, you know?
If it's some random personal code then we're completely lost.
Okay.
All right, now, what about letters?
For example, six would be M-N-O.
M, N and O.
All right, we got a Mike here who's listed as a member of the Tombs.
All right, so that would be six-four...
Nope.
Not six-four.
What about a Nathan?
- Six-two.
- Nope.
Okay, what about a Monique?
Okay, six-six...
Yep, that's it.
Six-six-six-four.
Monique, we know that you paged Cole two weeks ago.
Triple-six four spells out the beginning of your name.
A lot of names start like that.
You're the one that was identified by the clerk at the store, Monique.
He remembered you because you cursed him out for not giving you a cigarette.
They charged a buck 50 for a loosey.
So you were there.
- And you did page Cole.
- Ain't no law against that.
You have beef with Cole?
A fight that you wanna take to the next level?
- I didn't do nothing to him.
- Did somebody get shot?
And that's why you were calling Cole, so he could come over and patch them up?
It was a 10-10.
Who got jumped in?
My boyfriend, Trevor.
He got beat bad.
- I didn't know who else to call.
- I'm glad you paged me.
- Trevor.
Hey, man, look at me.
- Man, go away.
Nobody told you to come here.
Yeah, well, you let 10 fools beat on you for 10 minutes.
Now you in a gang.
Took it like a man.
Nobody got over on me.
Yeah, but you're smarter than this, Trevor.
This beat-down could have killed you.
- There's a lot of ways out here to die.
- What are you doing?
Trevor, we were working this, man.
Why would you come out of the plan now?
Talk to me.
I was just playing hoops.
Stole the ball from this guy and he tripped.
I laughed, you know, just messing.
Didn't know he was Lenox Crew.
He swore he'd kill me.
Orlando told me if I joined, the Tombs could protect me.
All right.
Look at me, man.
I got a job, Trevor.
All right?
I'm not packing weed I'm not running guns for Orlando so he can get a nice new ride.
- It can happen.
- Out here?
On 115th?
No.
No.
I need an insurance policy, and you can't be it.
Trev.
Yo, Trev.
No.
No, don't do this.
I ain't got no choice.
Do you know where Trevor is now?
No.
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
His mother is out of town on a job.
I have a key to his place.
I could give it to you.
- Apartment is clear.
- Told you Trevor wasn't here.
You could have found that out without dragging me.
- Is he your boyfriend?
Is he?
- Yeah.
Because we thought that you'd wanna help us find him.
I understand you're just trying to stay out of trouble, but listen.
Keeping quiet is not gonna help.
You didn't give us the keys to the apartment because you like doing favors for the FBI.
Did you think we were gonna find a body here?
Not telling us about a murder or kidnapping makes you an accessory, which means you're gonna go to jail.
It doesn't matter that you're 14.
Do you understand that?
So you wanna start over?
Okay.
Cole was here last night.
He was looking for Trevor.
I gave you $ 10,000, Lando.
Why not just take it?
Because I changed my mind.
Little homey gonna make a real good soldier.
Let his cartoon-watching ass fool you.
Look, come on, man.
I told you what his teachers said.
Only time I've heard the word "potential" used so many times is when they was talking about your skinny ass.
Now, look, man, I'm asking you as a favor.
For old times' sake, don't do this.
Man, why do you keep plucking at them old memory strings?
- Waking and baking, yeah, it was cool.
- Yeah, we were like brothers, man.
And that's the word you keep forgetting:
Were.
Why do I owe you anything?
You jump off and now you come strutting back?
Everybody all looking up at you with your fancy equipment.
Well, Trevor, that's my equipment.
So you need to step off.
I can't do that.
Look, Trevor has a chance.
Let him take it.
How does that feel?
Your fancy training gonna save you now?
Hey, Trev.
Little man.
Cole here wants to rescue you.
You wanna be alone?
Fly free on the streets?
- Trevor, don't listen to him.
- Shut up.
No.
Then hold this for me.
Gotta go.
Now, show me what you're made of, little man.
That was it.
Orlando left.
- Trevor told me to go too.
- You haven't heard from Trevor since?
I was hoping you guys could find him before he did something stupid.
- What do you think happened to Cole?
- You know.
Sorry we had to pick you up at your baby's mama's house.
Next time, don't hide behind your lady's skirt, okay, Orlando?
- Didn't know y'all was looking for me.
- Well, we were.
Where the hell is Cole?
I don't know what you're talking about.
We know you were at Trevor's last night.
Who'd y'all talk to?
Crackhead ho Monique?
She hallucinates.
We didn't find crackhead ho Monique.
What we did find was a lot of people that were excited about helping us move you to a federal address.
You know, I think you put your boy, Trevor, up to killing Cole.
- You ain't got nothing to say about that?
- What you think?
Well, if you have nothing to say, then you're free to go.
Because we don't need you.
Come on, go.
- What?
- Trevor's 14 years old.
How far do you think a 14-year-old with a dead body's gonna get?
- That was good, covering for Monique.
- Thanks.
I don't think we should put this guy back on the street.
Listen, N.Y.P.D.'s gonna trail him, we're good, okay?
- I'm telling you.
- We're good.
- Hello.
- Hey.
I got your message, obviously.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, no problem.
Can I get you something?
- Yeah.
- It's just water.
Vodka tonic, please.
Thanks.
It's a little early in the day for that, don't you think?
Well, you did invite me to a bar.
Well, a good point.
Probably should have ordered one myself.
So have you thought about your father?
Well, I'm torn.
Between honoring the last wishes of a crazy old man or giving him the final flying finger.
I know it's stupid.
I did look into it.
And you can overturn his decision if you want.
- Really?
- But I wouldn't recommend it, Jack.
Why not?
Your dad's dead, Jack.
You have to let go.
Yeah, well, I will certainly take that under advisement.
You know what?
I want to...
I want to apologize for this morning.
- Oh, yeah.
- It was just so out of line.
I have no idea what came over me, I just...
Look, I don't even think of you that way.
You know what?
That did not come out the way I wanted it to come out.
I'm sorry.
I understand.
You know what I mean.
I just...
It...
Hang on a sec, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Gotta go.
- Yep.
I...
I have to go.
And I'm really sorry about what happened.
And it was really inappropriate for me to do that.
- And now it's over.
- Really?
- You know, we could talk about...
- No.
It doesn't matter.
Okay.
- So we're good?
- We are.
Has Orlando called Trevor?
He made three calls to the same number the second he left.
He's worried about where the kid dumped the body.
I got the number he called.
I'm just triangulating the location from the signal.
- All right, I got it.
- Where is he?
Signal's coming from Edgecomb Hospital, where Cole went missing.
One of the boys from the church.
I recognize him.
Cole brought him on the run with us once.
I haven't seen him since.
- What time did you go back on duty?
- A half hour ago.
I was getting equipment ready for the next run.
What's up?
I left the door to the bus open, now it's closed.
- Where's Cole?
- Hey, man, I don't know.
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.
- Come on out.
Easy.
You were the last person to see Cole alive.
And I know Orlando told you to kill him.
You help us, we'll help you.
Oh, man, I swear, I didn't do nothing.
I didn't kill Cole.
Move out, let's go.
Think this'll keep my blood from splattering?
Shut up.
I gotta think.
Right.
Right.
Think.
But not about how you gonna clean up this mess from shooting me but how your life will never be the same if you do this.
I said shut up.
- You're not a killer, Trevor.
- What do you know about me?
A killer would have shot me and been at the refrigerator for something to eat.
- I'm warning you.
- I know a killer wouldn't spend time over a dummy practicing to save a life.
What the hell do you know?
You got out.
Never made your bone.
Yeah, I did.
I thought killing someone would make me a man too.
We do this thing, man, we in.
Solid gold, homes.
Tombs forever.
So how about him?
Orders are:
Civilian male.
Show him no mercy.
He it then.
I killed him.
And all he was doing was walking home from school.
Orlando told that story with him doing the shooting.
I know, I let him.
Because the only story I had to tell was how I puked every night.
And how I couldn't get his face out of my head.
And how I could hear his family crying no matter where I was.
Come on, Cole, turn around.
Why?
If you shoot me you will see my face every night for the rest of your life whether I turn around or not.
So go ahead, man.
Make your bone.
What if I wanna get out?
How can I?
Orlando will kill us both.
You let me worry about that.
Let go.
Let go.
It's okay, man.
It's over.
Cole came up with a plan.
A school I could go to, live there, get out that neighborhood.
He was gonna pay for the first year.
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.
He told me to come here.
Ask Joe for the key to his place in Tarrytown, go there and wait.
- And he didn't say where he was going?
- He said he had to go see somebody.
Stay put.
Watch him.
So we were both right.
This guy's a killer.
- Who turned his life around.
- I just hope it's not too late, Viv.
Okay, bad news.
You know the tail on Orlando?
N.Y.P.D. Lost him.
All right, I checked the records in unsolved murders in Harlem.
The young man who Cole killed?
I think this is him.
Reverend Hovis' son.
Reverend, please, you need to talk to us.
So where's Cole?
Where is he?
- I don't know.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where is Cole?
He came by.
I wish he hadn't.
Cole, what's going on?
The FBI was just here.
One of the boys told me Orlando's trying to hurt you.
I know, I crossed him, so now he wants to kill me.
- Well, should I call the police?
- No.
Orlando doesn't matter.
Reverend, I came here today because...
If something does happen to me, I need you to know that...
- Know what, son?
- Don't call me that.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Calm down, Cole.
Believe me, I've heard the worst of what's in men's souls.
- Anything and I...
- I killed your son.
What?
I shot Miles.
I'm the one that killed him.
- No.
- Look, I came to his funeral and I don't even know why.
But when I heard you preach it just changed me.
I swore that I would try and make up for everything I've ever done...
- Make up?
Make up?
You think by stitching up those hoodlums makes up for killing my boy?
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Get out of my face.
Get out!
Reverend, look, I don't...
I don't expect your forgiveness.
I gotta catch a bus.
That's the address of where I'll be.
Whatever you need to do.
That was it.
He left.
- I know I should have called you.
- What was the address?
Someplace in Tarrytown.
- And nothing happened after Cole left?
- No.
Your Bible got knocked over.
Why didn't you pick it up?
You know, I've been going to church my whole life and on a normal day there isn't a holy man alive who'd leave his Bible on the floor.
Here.
Take your Bible.
Take it.
Take it.
What did you do to Cole?
I gave Orlando the address.
How long ago was this?
About an hour ago.
All right, there's the bus.
It must have gotten in early.
Service through to Manhattan will begin boarding in 15 minutes.
And there's Cole and Orlando.
Let's go.
He's got a gun.
Get out of here.
Get out, get out, get out.
Drop the gun, FBI.
Everybody move clear.
- Did you find Trevor?
- Everybody's okay.
Orlando, put the weapon down.
No one needs to get hurt.
Come on, Orlando.
It doesn't have to go down like this, coz.
Drop the weapon, Orlando.
Blood out, coz.
This is Agent Delgado, I need an ambulance, please, now.
You're gonna be all right.
- Is Trevor okay?
- Trevor's fine.
Don't talk.
L...
I made plans for him at a school, okay?
The mo...
The money...
Money...
Trevor?
- You excited about your new school?
- No.
Well, you should be.
This is a big opportunity for you.
Cole give this to you?
You wanna make him proud of you, don't you?
Well, here's your shot to do that, so don't blow it.
Office, cell.
Whatever you need, you call me day or night.
Nobody makes it alone, Trevor.
Nobody.
- Hi.
- Hey.
He looks good.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
He would have liked that.
Thank you.
Hope you're happy.

DISTANCE
Ajab is a direct hit, normally to the face.
If you're tall and broad, you can stop your rival with long left jabs, waiting for the time to land a right.
It's not easy, you have to dance.
The cutcomes up and the hook hits the side.
They're curve shots, hard and short, not used to get distance.
You go in, absorb his defence, get close, and toss the bomb that could knock him out.
But it's hard, you have to know how to suffer.
I box in line, that's my style.
I'm rarely head-to-head, and I slug right up to the bell.
Anyone who's been there knows what the pain is like.
I'm tough, I should try it, but whenever I do, something makes me box at a distance.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
The contender is up, 40 seconds to go in the round.
You okay?
The ref continues the fight.
Two lefts, Dani!
Get distance!
Two lefts!
José Yebes Mota wins for the third consecutive time the super-welterweight title with a KO in the 8th.
You got it?
- Do you want to take it?
- No.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
- Sit down.
- Who are you looking for?
You.
You made a mistake.
I don't know you.
What about this?
Seen it before?
What do you want?
Answer me.
It'll save time and trouble.
No.
This is illegal.
Why didn't you request a proper interrogation?
It's a photo of a pipe underneath a tobacco shop.
The gun inside was used to kill the owner.
AWalther.
The serial number is enlarged.
Ring a bell now?
I don't know who you are or why you're here.
I'm done talking to you.
Fine, I'll go to the courts.
- What the hell do you want?
- Answers!
I've never seen it before.
Wait.
Where are you going?
To the cops.
To see if they think your prints are on the gun too.
You're not a cop?
No.
But that won't help you.
Who are you?
I don't know what you want, but it's useless.
My case is closed.
You don't get it.
You only got off because there was no evidence.
There were two of you, so one of you did it.
You said it was him, but your friend couldn't protest because the cops killed him, and the D.A. Had no murder weapon.
Now he can have it.
You won't be tried for robbing a tobacconist, but for homicide.
It's been two years.
I've 10 days to go.
Why now?
For a good reason.
The new owner changed the floor tiles.
You won't get out in ten days, Daniel, but ten years.
I didn't do it.
I might've held it, but I didn't shoot it.
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Then start now.
What?
Manuel Salgado.
He's in your section.
Today's Thursday.
You have until Sunday to make him an obituary.
If you do it, the gun is history.
If not, I'll hand it to the judge.
What do you mean?
You can hope the system will find you innocent.
But your chances are slim, and someone would shoot you at your front door, or outside the gym.
Get outta here.
You can get out with a murder, or rot in jail for one you didn't do.
I'm taking your word for it, you better take mine.
Three days.
- José Gabarri.
- Yeah.
- Luis Rivas.
- Yeah.
- Andrés Rellán.
- Here.
- Said Mazorid.
- Yes.
- Manuel Salgado.
- Yes.
- Antón San Vicente.
- Yeah.
Javier Santonja.
- Something wrong with my face?
- What?
- What're you looking at?
- Manuel Salgado.
Yes?
To the infirmary, come on.
This way.
You'll get hit.
Thanks.
I'm still not used to this place.
Been inside long?
A year, but I just got transferred.
Do I know you?
Yeah, from lunch yesterday.
Oh, yeah.
- Shall I go with you?
- It'll be a help.
A screw usually helps me, but I don't know where he is.
Can I hold onto you?
Yeah, come on.
Shit.
Do you work out?
Yeah, it's a bit hard in here, but I try to keep fit.
I used to work out, play football.
I've seen that, the ball has bells on it.
No, regular football.
- You want to sit down?
- Yes.
Come here.
- What's your name?
- Daniel.
I'm Manuel.
Daniel and Manuel.
You want one?
No.
Sport and all that, eh?
What are you in for, Manuel?
I killed four men.
Right.
- Don't I look like a murderer?
- You wouldn't be in this unit.
Accounting trouble.
I didn't think they jailed you for that.
Depends on the circumstances.
They say you had a strip club.
It sucks being blind while everyone can see you.
Was it a friend?
No, just some guy.
- You got family?
- What?
Atransfer means you're getting out.
That's too many questions.
- Who are you?
What did you do?
- Relax.
I'll go if you want, I just wanted to talk.
- And be my friend?
- Yeah.
First time in jail?
Yeah.
No family, just my wife, and she won't be waiting for me.
I was a bastard.
I really hurt her.
I want her to forgive me for something bad.
I want to get back what I had.
The last time I touched her, I could see her.
- I've no idea how it'll be now.
- The same.
Okay, Manuel.
I gotta go.
Good luck.
Wait.
I want to know what you're like, what my friend Daniel is like.
Sure.
You got long to go?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
- You wanted to be my friend, right?
- What?
I have money.
I'll get it if you don't trust me.
What's wrong, kid?
I trust you.
Well...
Shall we go to the showers?
Can you go alone?
I don't want us to be seen together.
I'll wait for you.
Is that you?
Yeah.
Come on.
Right, left and dodge.
Pass him and punch.
Right, dodge and punch.
Time.
Rest up.
Fill those lungs and exhale.
How ya doin'?
- Hello.
- Hello, Dani.
- Can I have a word?
- Sure.
Carry on the workout.
Go from bags to punching, or shadow box in pairs.
- Kid looks pretty good.
- Who?
In the ring, he did good.
He's got a fight in 15 days.
He's good.
- I just got out.
- Wasn't it next week?
Yes, they let me out three days early.
It was hanging outside before.
Who's champ now?
- He is.
- Him?
I thought he'd make the European titles.
He got hurt, didn't box for a year.
- He won it back 6 months ago.
- Is he okay?
Better than he was.
How can I help you?
I couldn't box much inside, but I ran and did weights.
I want to train again.
In a month I'll be in shape, maybe not for a fight, but I'd give it a try.
I can't help you.
I was inside for 2 years, I paid my debt.
Your rules aren't mine.
Then I should go before I get another two years.
I wish you good luck.
Like fuck you do!
I spent my life in this gym.
I was one of your best boxers!
I made one mistake!
And I paid for it!
No!
The dead guy's family disagrees.
- I didn't kill him.
- I don't trust you.
I never lied to you.
It was great to see you.
Dani...
I want your word that you're not a murderer.
- Why?
- I need it to help you.
I'm not a murderer.
You have my word.
Look at your past, pay off your debts, get your life together and get a job.
If you do all that, you can train here.
Are you sure?
If you keep your word, I'll keep mine.
What is this?
- Stop!
Police.
- What did I do?
Shut up.
- Frisk him.
- Spread 'em.
- Do you know him?
- No.
Why?
He's been following you for ten blocks.
We're taking him in.
Come on.
- What for?
- To file a report.
I didn't see anything.
Leave me alone.
Probation.
Puerta de Hierro Prison.
Cooperate, or I'll let him go.
- Was he armed?
- No.
You're out one day and already under arrest.
Great.
- I don't know why I'm here.
- I'll tell you.
You followed a woman under police protection.
Her husband was killed in the jail you left today.
- I didn't follow anyone.
- Did you know him?
Who?
I never saw her before.
Salgado.
He was killed a week before you got out.
He was in my section.
We know.
We want to know if you knew him.
- Yes.
- Who did it?
- How the hell do I know?
- Okay.
Why were you following her?
- I said wasn't.
- What were you doing?
I wanted a fuck.
What?
- He said he had a strip club.
- Salgado.
Yes, with hot girls.
It's been 2 years.
- So you were friends?
- Why?
- He invited you to his brothel.
- He just gave me the address.
We only talked once.
When did you last see him?
Days before he was killed we ate together.
- Do you know his friends?
- No.
You never saw him with anyone?
Sure, but he was usually alone.
He'd just arrived, he didn't have friends.
- And the day he was killed?
- This is from thejail.
- Where were you that day?
- You're reading it.
Why didn't you say you had a weekend pass?
You only just asked.
I don't know this guy, or who killed him.
I know nothing.
I wasn't following her and I won't go back to jail.
Leave that up to us.
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.
Say who told you to follow her and you can go.
Not again!
I wasn't following anyone!
- Where do you live?
- Estrecho.
It's the other way.
Why were you there?
My gym's nearby.
- You went from jail to a gym?
- I'm a boxer.
- He took my wallet.
- Give it to him.
The address of the gym.
You've got no priors.
Why rob that shop?
Hey, you!
You fucked up my night!
- A car can take you home.
- I'd rather walk.
- Get away from her!
- I was talking to him.
Hey!
- I'm sorry.
- You wanna fuck, huh?
Me too, but to make ends meet.
Hold on.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't...
It's all I have.
Take it.
No, never mind.
Are you sure?
You wanna fuck me?
You going to the club?
Well, they're closing.
We can fuck at your place, or in your car.
I don't have a place, I was going to a hostel.
We can use my place.
They thought I'd hurt you.
You want to or not?
Yes.
Like a drink?
No.
Pay up now, please.
Thanks, babe.
Come on.
Take 'em off and sit down.
You're strong.
Do you really box?
Yeah.
- What's your name?
- Daniel.
What's yours?
Raquel.
They rhyme.
Nice dick you got there.
Why were the cops following you?
Don't worry, babe.
Concentrate or you won't get it up.
Wait.
Stop.
- Anything wrong?
- No.
What do you like?
Hold on.
Come here.
Lie down with me.
- I've had a bad day.
- Then relax.
We can try again later.
- You'd prefer another girl.
- It's not that.
I met your husband in jail.
I was a whore when we met, if it bothers you.
No, but it's strange.
What?
I only met him once and he talked about you.
He wanted you back.
How nice.
I can see why.
I'm usually the one who lies to customers.
Come here.
Turn around.
- You're very brave.
- Why?
You aren't afraid of me.
- Should I be?
- No, I promise you that.
- Can I stay?
- No.
Can I see you again?
You know where the club is.
I'll be there.
Bye, liar.
Jab!
Jab!
Watch your side!
Great!
That's good.
Perfect!
Try and hit low.
Great.
Nice hook!
Great!
Hit low!
No, no!
Hold it!
You're head-on, your hand's behind.
Feint and punch.
There, there.
Time!
Shadow boxing in the ring.
Everyone on the ropes.
The posters are here.
- You hear me?
- Ljumped rope twice.
Anyone else done that?
The bag.
What is it?
Aren't you going to drop back?
Aren't you?
I'm punching close.
I'm asking you why you're not dropping back.
Do I have to?
No, but there's one problem.
You hit hard, but so does he.
Can you hold your ground during a hammering?
I dunno.
I haven't sparred with anyone.
I know.
I think you're lying to me.
If you fake that you can hold your ground, he'll knock you out.
If you say you're ready, and you're not,
I won't let you in the ring.
Break your word and I'll throw you out.
You haven't sparred yet, or found a job.
Do it or get out!
Box at a distance.
Punch a flurry and get out again.
Time!
- Hey, sexy.
- Hello.
Want a good time?
- I'm looking for another girl.
- Your loss, honey.
Tell me who and I'll get her.
I can't see her.
The reserved area's empty.
Unless she's in the show, you'll end up alone.
Think it over.
Good evening and welcome to another night at Club Fantasy.
A big hand for Diana Chan.
One for me...
And for Carla.
Awoman who can make any man happy.
Carla!
Who is it?
Daniel.
From the other day.
- What do you want?
- To come up.
- Hello.
- You okay?
- You weren't at the club.
- I got fired.
Why?
They said to go till I get the cops off my ass.
- You want a drink?
- No.
I'll have to fuck 'em just so they leave me alone.
Who are they protecting you from?
I don't know.
- Why are you here?
- To see you.
I told you that.
You smell nice.
I'll go get cleaned up.
- It's weird.
- What is?
- That they fired you.
It's your club.
- What?
If your husband's dead, it's yours.
No, he sold it.
That fucker got it for a song and now he fires me like some new bitch.
Does this look like a palace to you?
No.
- Do you have the papers?
- What papers?
From the sale.
They threatened him and now you.
If they got it illegally, it's yours.
What do you want?
You've changed since last time.
Don't move.
- Are you alright?
- Now I am.
Don't worry about a thing.
That's easy to say.
And to do.
How?
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I'll take care of you.
Hang on.
Where did you come from?
I'm sorry.
I'm not crazy.
I just like you.
You're different, you know?
No, I don't think so.
I take care of my own problems.
Can I pay you?
You have to pay me.
Can I see you again?
Whenever you want.
Come with me or I'll kill you right here.
Get out.
What do you want?
Get out.
What the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing, asshole?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
- What did you tell the cops?
- Nothing.
They don't know anything.
They think I had a pass when I killed him!
- Why are you seeing her?
- She doesn't know who I am.
She won't talk, so do what you want.
What do I want, asshole?
She won't try to get the club back.
What are you on about?
Why are you seeing her?
The cops are hassling her.
I wanted to help her.
- Are you stupid?
- I wanted to give her money.
You didn't answer my question.
Are you stupid?
Yes.
You want the cops off her back?
That's easy.
Just tell them you killed her husband.
Tell her when you pay her.
She'll be overjoyed.
You're not stupid, no, you'rejust sweet.
Now be sweet to me and keep me out of jail.
What do I do?
- What do you want me to do?
- Die.
Move it, you'll ruin my car.
Please don't do it.
You killed a man in cold blood?
Where did a specimen like you get the guts to kill anyone?
Let me go.
I won't go back, I promise.
Don't do it, please.
Give me a reason not to.
You won't feel any better.
But I'll feel stronger.
Get in the fucking car!
You've got blood on you.
Get the next bus and go far away.
Stay away from her.
Never mention her name or the club.
Go near her and you're dead.
Want a drink?
No.
Where'd you leave him?
He won't be found in a long time.
Did you pick up the shells and ditch the gun?
Yes.
You're not making the same mistake twice.
Relax.
I am relaxed.
You did what you had to do.
No.
- He wasn't a problem.
- Now we're sure.
That's it, it's over.
No.
The wife has cops all over her.
It's been a month.
She won't talk.
She probably knows nothing.
We'll watch her until they give it up.
Or start watching me.
I'll be the first to know and you'll be covered.
Don't worry, it'll be over before that.
I hope so.
Stop the fucking bus!
Set up the first fight.
I'll be right out.
You... and you, Alex!
Headgear and gloves.
- He said to go for a run.
- Okay.
Did you warm up?
Headgear and gloves.
Running and shadow-boxing!
Everyone else, time!
- Are you going to replace him?
- With who?
Don't fight messy, throw steady punches.
Awild flurry is shit if you're not ready for the next.
Keep your distance and hands out.
He's stronger than you.
Time!
Lift your guard!
What are you doing?
Dodge him!
Get back!
Dani!
What the hell are you doing?
Holding on till I hit him.
Holding on till you hit him.
And I trained you for ten years.
You alright?
You know the strategy.
He'll block thejabs, then knock you out.
Go on, box.
That position hurts, right?
Get back, pull those hands away.
Time!
Dani...
Hit the lockers and weigh yourself.
How much?
77.6.
There's a match in two days.
You want it?
Yeah.
Be at the right weight by the weekend.
Is he any good?
He's strong, the purse is good.
You won't win, but it'll last until you get a job.
It's a farewell gift.
I don't want you back here.
Nothing to say?
Go finish training.
Fuck.
- Why didn't you buzz me?
- It was open.
- What's up with your eye?
- Just a punch.
I'm with a trick.
Can you come back?
Can't I wait inside?
Wait there.
Bye, honey.
Here I am.
Who was that?
- Wanna be my pimp?
- No.
And I don't want one.
Why don't you go?
- I thought he was hurting you.
- Yeah.
Butt-fucking me to be exact.
I was just worried.
Why?
Don't you get it?
Look at you, you get paid for pain too.
It's different.
Really?
It doesn't hurt?
I wanted to help you.
Don't get mad.
Know what's worse than ending every day fucked?
Being alone.
The ones that run out the door are the ones who try to help you.
I lie to them and then they're gone.
So tell me what you want to hear, but don't worry about me, I always end up losing.
- One of them might not leave.
- Who, that guy?
You?
How long are you staying?
All night.
You're pretty rich for a guy fresh out of jail.
I've got a fight.
And you're spending it on me?
If you're going to box, you better fix that cut.
- Come here.
- No, forget it.
Come here.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- You always felt like that?
- Like what?
You always felt alone?
No.
Once I thought I'd never be alone.
With your husband.
He was the one who fucked it up.
Someone else?
Something like that.
He saw you together and did this.
Why did I tell you?
Come here.
Come on.
You want to go to the bedroom?
I'm not in a rush.
Come to the fight.
Why?
To show me it doesn't hurt?
It hurts alright.
Then I'd rather not go.
It'll be special.
Why?
It's my last fight.
- You're quitting?
- I'm headin' out.
Where to?
I don't know.
Why don't you come with me?
- Why are you getting shitty?
- Did you hear what I said?
Yes.
- But you make me feel good.
- That's you.
What about me?
We've got nothing, so we've got nothing to lose.
That's not enough.
I like you.
- I think...
- Be careful what you say.
I love you.
After the fight I'm taking off.
You've got nothing to lose.
You're wrong about that.
I can take care of you.
Fuck me.
You there?
Yes, I'm here.
- What's up?
- He's with a girl.
- Are they alone?
- Yes, I think so.
Hang on.
- Okay.
- Anything wrong?
We've stopped.
Call you later.
Tighten the dressing, we're up.
- How you doin'?
- Good.
There are other gyms.
Comfortable?
Warm up a bit, then we'll take a look.
Kill me.
- What?
- That's why you're here, right?
- You were shaking last time.
- Not today.
You're not on the poster.
You're just a sub, huh?
Why are you here?
What's she doing here?
She came to watch me.
You're dumber than I thought.
I told you two things, leave and stay away from her.
What the hell are you doing?
We're leaving after the fight.
"We're leaving"?
You're my nightmare, you fuck.
Sparing you once wasn't enough?
You want to go round again?
I can't leave.
I don't believe this.
You're a fool, a complete fool.
You don't know what you're getting into.
If you have to kill me, be sure you can get over it.
The feelings I got ain't worth it.
I'll never feel like you.
I'm not weak, I'm no loser!
Hit the canvas and let him pulverize you.
You're dead.
Now to our next fight.
A super-welterweight battle lasting 6 rounds.
In red, with 14 wins, 11 K.O.'s and 3 defeats...
Sergey Eremeev!
In black, with 12 wins, 4 K.O.'s and two defeats...
Daniel Torres!
Watch your heads and no low blows.
I won't warn you again.
Pat gloves and good luck.
- Does he scare you?
- He's tall.
So you watch his feet.
Going for a K.O. Means losing on points.
Dodge his attack and go for points.
It's your trump card, okay?
What are you doing?
Separate!
Aim!
Aim!
Side-step, side-step.
Get out of there!
Dani!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
You alright?
Box!
Punch and get out!
Hit low, cross over.
Good.
He's yours, Dani!
Get in.
Now!
Now!
What are you doing?
Deck him while he's groggy.
I can do it now.
He'll come back stronger, you can't surprise him.
I'm not going to.
What do you mean?
Seconds out!
Block with your left.
Come from under, cross hard.
But keep your distance!
Easy, Dani.
Back!
Get back!
That's it, keep it up.
You got him.
He's groggy!
Break.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Knock out!
Good going, champ.
Congratulations, Dani.
I told you.
Thanks, Isra.
Come here for a second.
Do you know Paco?
Yebes Mota's promoter.
- Hey, what's up?
- Congrats.
I came to see your rival about a fight, but after that, he's not up to it.
How do you feel?
- Good.
- We'll wait a few days to be sure.
- Think it over and call me.
- Great.
Keep it up.
You want to do it?
I'm a bit tired.
Can we talk tomorrow?
- Got the purse?
- In a while.
Leave it in the gym.
I'll pick it up later.
Hey, champ.
Leave me alone.
- Just a quick word.
- About what?
Not here.
Come with us.
- Someone's waiting for me.
- I know.
Relax, we'll take her home.
And if I say no?
You can't.
Where are we?
Forensics, Justice Department.
- How come we're here?
- I want you to see something.
- What do you know about this?
- About what?
The girl's after you, the bad guys...
Someone must've talked.
Let's start with her.
- You know more than me.
- Good.
Let's share information.
The club, right?
They want the club.
Are you kidding me?
No, you're not.
You're way over your head.
If they just wanted a brothel, it'd be easy.
Fuck!
What is that?
This was José, a real shitbag, a dealer on his way up.
Shot in the head.
They broke his jaw first, maybe with an iron bar.
His thighbone and shins too.
The ribs are broken and gaping, maybe from a kicking.
They cut off his hand with a machete or an axe.
There's an entry and exit wound, but the bullet and shell were never found.
The hand's missing too.
Why show me this?
The body turned up a year ago, but 6 years ago, when he was killed, this police chief confiscated a huge drug shipment.
Now he's top brass.
This was a cop under him.
He was caught dumping a dismantled automatic.
In his trunk was this axe, with no traces of blood.
The body hadn't been found and he disappeared.
Interpol found him 6 months ago.
He can be extradited.
He was the torturer and he contacted Salgado, the pimp who died in prison.
He wanted to hide someone and Salgado had a basement he used for smuggled cigarettes.
When he found out its purpose, it was too late.
I don't get it.
What do you want?
They pounded the dealer for the location of the drugs.
But the torture went too far and they shot him.
I know who ordered it and who did it.
I just need evidence, but with no bullet or case, I can't prove he used this gun.
A cut marks the bone, but with deterioration a forensic couldn't prove he used the axe.
Maybe the hand's in better condition.
If I linked the weapons to the body, I'd have proof.
- What do I know?
- Salgado knew about it.
They removed the body so fast, they left the other remains.
He buried the hand, bullet and shell.
But they killed him.
How do I fit in?
His wife may know their location, but she won't talk.
We want your help.
- How?
- Ask her.
- She won't talk to us.
- No, forget it.
- Think about it.
- Why?
Because you killed Salgado.
Ten testimonies state that your weekend pass was forged.
Maybe by the same guy who told you to kill him.
One of these two guys.
This one's a fascist cop.
You're dead if he's after you.
We only know that this one's a fag and a year ago he requested a transfer to Homicide.
Why would they be after me?
They already are.
We're not idiots.
Since you're still alive, you dealt with the fag.
So do yourself a favour, grab the chance.
If you get what we want, we won't put you back inside.
You got no proof.
No.
I need real evidence for a trial.
This involves some big fish.
You're worth shit.
Why did I show you the body?
It's my plan B.
I let him know all about you so in six years time we dig up your body.
With you, I don't need proof.
Play ball and you'll live.
- Think of the jail time as a tip.
- Can I go?
Think it over.
- Do you want police protection?
- Can I go?
Be careful.
Hey, boxer.
Hey, cop.
I hope you're the last.
- Congratulations.
- What for?
You won.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
- You blew that chance.
- So what do you want?
The same as them, to ask her where to find what her husband hid.
- Didn't they ask you that?
- They threatened to put me in jail.
- What about you?
- They can't jail you without proof.
They haven't got it.
They're squeezing you.
They can't prove you tortured him.
I won't talk, so leave us alone.
"Us"?
Forget that shit.
I'm doing you a favor.
If you're not with them, nothing'll happen to you.
But forget her.
How does it feel after a murder like that?
That was years ago, I wasn't there.
But I'm curious.
You tell me...
You've done it.
Why are you protecting them?
They had no evidence.
He was a dealer and murderer, but they had no evidence.
He wouldn't have talked, and a search was useless.
There was only one way:
No rules and no evidence.
You think they're better than us?
Their threats mean they've got nothing.
They're not protecting the whore, but squeezing her because they've got no proof.
Her husband was dying of cerebral cancer.
He should've been let out after a month, but they kept him inside for a year to get him to cooperate... because they had no evidence.
You're not dying, Daniel, and testifying won't help you.
Let me help you.
Like you helped me in jail?
I had evidence.
I didn't kill anyone.
Who cares about the truth?
What if I don't do it?
They'll kill you and the lady.
You wouldn't dare.
Don't you dare touch her!
You're not afraid of me anymore.
Just don't be afraid of whoever comes after me.
You've got three days, just like last time.
I'll find you.
Bye, Daniel.
I'm sorry you met me.
I'm not sorry.
I forgive you.
Who the hell are you?
What do you know about me?
Who are you to forgive me?
The Messiah?
No, he was dumber than you and he lost it all.
You made a deal with me to avoid jail time.
You're offended by a dead body, but not by an offer of immunity for murder.
You feel guilty, but you fuck his wife instead of telling her who you are.
Nothing belongs to you.
How are you better than me?
Know why we're threatening that whore?
For you!
We knew she wasn't going to the cops.
Your desire to protect her is getting her involved.
Your need to redeem yourself is fucking her up.
You gonna keep her?
Make her happy?
What's on your mind when you fuck that drunk?
Why didn't you risk it?
- When?
- In jail.
Why not call my bluff?
I had nothing solid,
I wouldn't have given the gun to the judge.
You'd have gotten 3 years.
That's enough time.
To get though this?
To never box again.
So maybe it was worth it.
Give me what I want, leave her, and just box.
Choose what you'd rather lose.
- How come you're here?
- Why did you lie to me?
- I could've killed you.
- No.
- You'd never do that.
- What do you want?
I want to know why a dead guy is boxing.
He'll give us what we want.
It's riskier to kill him than to let him help us.
The guys upstairs agree.
So they told me.
You went over my head.
You piece of shit, you got no balls.
Or do you fancy this kid?
Until now he could only incriminate you, which is your problem, but you can incriminate me.
I'd never do that.
No.
I'd put a bullet in you first.
A real one.
- Yes?
- It's me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry, I got tied up.
Sit down.
What's wrong?
We've never seen each other in the daytime.
You look different.
Sorry I didn't wait for you.
I didn't ask you to explain.
- I got offered another fight.
- Well!
That's great.
Is it a big one?
Yeah.
Congratulations.
- How's the eye?
- It's fine, don't worry.
You have to take risks if it's important.
- Drink?
- No, I want to talk to you.
- I said you don't have to explain.
- It's not about you or me.
Your husband did a bad thing a while back.
I need to know where he hid something.
- Who are you?
- Listen, please.
You a cop?
- Your husband hid...
- I know!
Who are you?
I was chosen to ask you.
And I'm not a cop.
Those guys below are the least of your problems.
Get out.
They'll kill you!
Now will you listen?
- I don't need you.
- Let me help you, please.
- I don't want your help.
- Then help me!
What's your connection?
Did you know all this when you met me?
No.
I don't know where it is.
The cops asked me a thousand times.
He never told me.
What's this?
The purse from the fight.
Get a ticket and go.
And you?
Why don't you come with me?
I can't.
I love you.
I'd be the worst thing for you.
I don't care.
I love you.
I killed your husband.
I don't care.
I love you.
I don't love you.
That does matter.
Daniel.
My husband did some bad shit.
He had to bury something.
I don't know if it's there.
Where will you go?
Don't come near me again.
Never lie to me again.
The detainee's statement is missing.
Someone's looking for you.
- Pull up your shirt.
- What?
How did you find me?
They said you were in Homicide.
Did you check that you weren't followed?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
- Yes, nobody followed me.
- Fuck.
You're crazy.
You'll drive me crazy too.
Wait here and don't move.
Daniel, look over there.
She said it was here?
It was the only place he'd hide something.
Then let's dig.
You alright?
Was she sure it was here?
No.
I told you that.
Wait!
Stop, stop.
What's this?
A child's skull.
No, I don't think so.
It's too small.
It's from a fetus.
You know about this?
I know she once thought she'd never be alone.
Don't hurt her, please.
She told us what she knew.
It doesn't matter if we find what we were after or if nobody ever does.
Don't ever see her again.
That'll be easy.
What about me?
I'd rather you disappeared.
What if I don't?
I'd protect you.
The bus from Bilbao is arriving at bay 6.
The southbound at bay 12 is about to depart.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Those are nines, right?
- Yeah.
- May I?
The armory ran out.
- Sure.
Fuck!
May I?
Impressive.
I tend to shoot left.
If I try to correct it, it's worse.
Watch.
See?
Always a bit left or below.
Come here.
Come on.
You know what's good about it?
When I've shot someone I've been out by centimeters.
I've seen guys who shoot perfectly in here, but on the street they panic.
This is fine for the Olympics, but in our game you can't get out of line.
How come you're out of line?
Who are you?
Come on.
Why are you mixed up in this shit?
I don't what you mean.
From a precinct to Homicide, then into a death squad.
Trying to prove something?
Speaking of which, does this prove anything?
An inmate saw the boxer follow Salgado into the john.
How does that concern me?
- You told him to kill the old guy.
- An inmate's accusing him?
For a reduction in his sentence?
Bad witness.
We haven't many good ones.
An inmate accusing another, a whore with something we want, a blind guy who can't identify his killer...
But I'll settle for a judge who wants your blood.
You here to subpoena me?
No, fool, you're our whole case.
The kid'll talk and you'll come clean or I'll get you on incitement to a murder.
No sentence reduction.
You're talking out of your ass.
I think you're a good guy.
Why not help us and forget the others?
Leave me alone.
Call me.
It'd be the smartest thing you've done in while.
I'll take this.
Your friend who rifles my files will have copies.
Keep it up.
You're the best shot I've seen in here.
What's wrong?
- A cop showed me these.
- What'll you do?
- They've got nothing.
- Yes, they do.
- They'll book your friend.
- He's not my friend.
Good.
It'll be easier for you to kill him.
What?
Touch him now and we're fucked.
It's what they want.
Nobody said "we".
I'm telling you to kill him.
- He won't talk.
- No, you'd better kill him.
You should've sorted it out some time ago.
And we'll know you're on our side.
If I wasn't, I'd be testifying and saving my ass.
I don't trust you.
- What'll you do?
- Kill both of you.
Why not the whore too?
Why not kill the cops?
And the judge?
Be careful.
You gonna kill me too?
Then do it now.
Say it again!
Tell me to kill you again.
Tell me to kill you again.
Now refuse to do it.
Changed your mind?
I'm watching your every fucking move.
Call in sick and stay at home.
If you see your friend, open your door to a cop, or talk to anyone on the phone but me, I'll kill you.
I'll spend the rest of my life in a banana republic, but you're not fucking this up.
I'll kill you, be sure of that.
Wait for my call.
Come on, open the door.
We're up in forty minutes.
Leave a message.
Pick up.
I'm at your friend's fight.
You want me to shoot him in the stadium?
Be here in half an hour, or I'm coming for you.
The last fight of the night, a 10-round super-welterweight bout.
In red, with 18 wins, 9 before time, and no defeats, our national champion...
José Manuel Yebes!
In black, with 13 wins, 5 before time, and 2 defeats...
Daniel Torres!
Gentlemen, no low blows, heads high.
Good luck to you both.
Pat gloves.
Wait for his strategy before you start yours.
Don't go in first, okay?
Daniel, take it easy.
Don't rush.
Waist!
Move your head!
Don't make it easy for him!
Get outta there!
Get back!
Get him, Dani!
Go!
What are you doing?
Weren't we going slow?
Waiting for his moves?
Adrenaline.
He got your distance and you didn't dodge him.
Use your waist, don't help him!
Deep breaths.
Seconds out!
Box.
Fuck, what's going on?
Dani, move it!
Drop back!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
You okay?
Box!
You got him!
He's yours!
Go for him!
Careful, Dani.
Fucking great, Dani.
You got him.
Now easy, don't rush.
He's slow, but still dangerous.
Work the dodges and hit low.
You have to stop his legs.
Leave before the boxers and shoot him in the hall.
A car will be waiting for you.
- Then who kills me?
- I will, if you don't do it.
You listening to me?
What are you lookin' at?
- Dani, you alright?
- Remember what I promised?
What?
You made me promise I wasn't a murderer.
Why bring that up now?
I lied to you.
I have killed a man.
Seconds out!
Don't worry, I'm gonna win.
Box!
Rigged!
Rigged!
Dani!
Where are you going?
That's it.
I've lost everything.
Are you gonna kill me?
Whatever happens, stay here.
Drop the gun!
Drop it and hands up!
Drop the gun!
Drop it.
Hands up.
Don't fuck with me.
Don't do anything stupid.
Grab him!
Where's the kid?
Leave the kid alone and I'll confess.
- To everything?
- Everything.
- Get him out.
- What?
Get him out of here!
Back.
Get back.
Make way.
Back a bit, please.
Hi.
Who are you?
I've never seen you before.
They sent you a long way.
Courtesy of the Force.
They didn't want me meeting any old busts.
- Was it hard getting here?
- Not very.
They looking after you?
They worry about my health.
Thanks for coming.
How are you?
Coping.
What about you?
Fine, I'm fine.
So how's it going?
Training for another fight?
How come?
Are you out of shape?
- Nobody left to fight?
- I quit.
You don't box anymore?
No.
Have you seen her again?
I wanted to say goodbye.
The trial's next week and I'll be incommunicado.
And when I get out, I'll be the one that's long gone.
What'll you get?
Nothing.
I'm a protected witness.
They'll claim self-defence, and my testimony will do the rest.
I won't be in here long.
That's fair.
Without you, they'd have nothing.
There's nothing fair about it.
I'll spend 15 days injail and anyone else'd get 15 years.
Justice has nothing to do it.
They have to cheat to make it work.
If I testify, it's not for justice, it's because I'm tired of cheating to make my life work.
You should go back to boxing, you're good.
I couldn't do it all again.
I'll be glad I knew you at your peak.
Your name won't come up at the trial, nothing connected with you, and I'll never say a thing.
But if anything happens, if you need help...
Keep this card and phone number.
Thanks.
No.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Bye, boxer.
Bye, cop.
Door open.
Visitor coming out.

I told it to you yesterday, dog.
- It is that since they shot me...
- No, alone I am you jodiendo.
Now alone it happened... he burned the bottom in the alley... it seems that they tortured him until death.
People say that Green made it.
- Tortured?
- If, tortured.
Not they could leave open the casket.
It was very jodío.
Cut in pieces, it began to smell as this.
Why you are not quiet?
He/she was our friend, it shows some respect.
You left very serious, alone jodiendo are.
Ah if, why you don't make something for that reason?
- You are a dog...
- We go, man...

- The same grass, brother.
Then... of high class, as your boots?
No, no... they gave it to me, alone to show that they mean something for me.

Will you go out with her?
They kill every day.
Was it sad, do you know?
And nobody knows the truth on Shaggy?
Did he/she have good shoes, do you know?
What do they look for these types?
It was strangled... it doesn't seem something of the bands.
All included one to strangle... not him you, alone it is... they eat, you joden, you arrechan... as all.
What do you mean?
He/she looks to your surroundings, not he/she is Beverly Hills... all jodidos are... do we go, what do they look for?
It is in it that we should work... what you/they want, what you/they look for, peace?
not him you.
Not you find the peace making what he made.
We go... who are?
do you bleed for the high thing?
is that faces?
Listen to me...
I have seen neighborhoods become in wars and this is a war.
Don't occur brilliant ideas.
You as us, you as me... he/she looks at the rest of us.
Single mantén the closed channel, these they are dogs... you catch a dog, you put it in the cage and there are 10 more than they come... for you, well?
Our work is to maintain the contained dogs.
To maintain the closed doors.
You know people of Shaggy, the one that mine was?
If?
Good... everything began when I fell, do you know what I say?
Perhaps they don't know that Shaggy it is dead.
Now they will allow you to take the things, do you know?
No, I already spoke with the one man, is Trigger.
Trigger takes everything now.
If...
As it is, he/she looks at this... he/she looks, he/she looks carefully.

I have been in all the places, there is not he/she differs here... with any place, nobody has alone time for if same.

Very well, I know Paradise Garden until Greendvally
And from Greend to Paradise I have been a damned police.

You want to make it well, that everything shines?
Look for you a wrecker, we go.
Why you never leave that Does Dusty visit Ángel?
I say, neither you let him to enter.
Joey, didn't want that you saw this way it.
I saw your father many times.
It would change you.
As it is... the detective?
He/she called you again.
He/she said that he/she should see you.
- She insists...
- Non memory anything.
- Alone you give him/her a call...
- He/she suckles, I don't remember anything...
I already spoke with her, one doesn't swim.
Not I can remember something that not you, not you...
I told him/her thousands of times that not you...

This in my head, I don't sit down it.
Not him you, suckles.
Not you what is real.
Anything makes sense for my now.
Joey... you are blessed, your you lived.
What did I make?
Not I made anything important...
Shaggy paid the rent since he/she had 16.
He stopped to the marksmen of here.

I want to speak to you of something.
What is it?
Do you keep it for you, if?
When I have told him/her to somebody a secret?
We go.
I believe that...
Shaggy and Vanessa they have something.
Of what do you speak?
I Thought that Vanessa he/she was the girl of Trigger.
It is it...
Shit, neither you tell it to me...
Trigger is a psychopath, do you understand that?
Not it can kill... as it is, it is something different, perhaps tripeen after that.
But Shaggy, we go, you know better than that.
If... you are right, walking...
Youthatfaces,you wanttoputto a cowboy as me in these books... itseemsthisway .
We go...
I am not so clever.
Not you responded to my question.
Not I have to tell it to you, I will show it to you... well, are you clever?
Green 101, the history of the violence.
as I like to call it, a column TO... a column B, everything it is for the earnings.
it is a game in some 400 blocks.
Sr. Wak, B is the brócolis... they are Greenville...
Paradise Gardens is those...
chickens to the orange.
I joust here... now... they are difficult to divide.
I already see... but the chicken to the orange it is spicier.
That is the point... these boys are very hot.
They are some conos.
- Go...
- It is always a disorder.
No, it is not always it, because... the conciliatory one... it is the rice.
Here there is a beautiful rice... it is what they call, Shaggy.
Now, Shaggy has respect of both... it maintains the peace... it maintains the trust...
Does Shaggy have respect, do you see?
But Shaggy...
It is dead.
Here we go... in fact.
Shaggy is dead... not but trust.
Everything, like they say...
it is pieces.
Jodido.
That simple, not?
Good, no...
And this murderer in series?
I have never seen something like that.
Very strange... it is Tofu...
damned Tofu.
Tofu that you mescló with that whole shit.
Do I murder in series?
Do you know what I believe?
The cook discharges.
- What but, dog?
- I can...
What dog, they cry for this whole shit?
Be quiet the mouth.
I told you that I am not of spirit for that shit...
No, no, no... it is a rude type with all here.
But you are still a dog, dog.
What dog does it happen?
Behind man.
Leave of joder.
We all know why we are here.
It is because we are killing.
They Are Those of Greenville.
They are crazy since we bounce to their boy.
He/she looks, you that you/they want to put on crazy with Greenville.
And believe me that if they made it, I will be the first in giving them.
We should think of this.
For a lot of time we live in trust.
Shaggy made that, he/she made us stronger.
But if we leave tonight... the trust finishes.
We will have a war, is that what you/they want?
No...no...
Shaggy is dead.
itisThisway ...
Greenville tortured to our siblings.
Jesse, do you know why?
Because alone they think... or they will see PG crawling.
They come it to leave, dogs.
But we need it now, Jesse.
We go, dog, if we don't hit to those conos now... they will kill you, to you and to my...
- and to all us.
- I don't like what you say.
We have spoken a lot.
Then they do want to take out me?
Is that what is?
Because if we think different, better they speak now.
No,Jesse.
We will be in charge of of the business.

Annabeth chase.
Prosecuting attorney's office.
This is my colleague maureen scofield, investigators blackwell and williams.
It's a tragedy, not only for the program, but for the entire community.
Billy raditzer was an outstanding young man, and I'm here to help in any way I can.
Good.
You can start by producing gary antrim and tommy murphy.
Well,I was hoping we could do this in a less dramatic fashion.
So were we.
What if they come down to your offices first thing in the morning, voluntarily,give a statement?
We're prepared to take their statements now.
We could haul everybody downtown for questioning.
That way the whole team,even the ball boys, will be in the early edition of sportscenter.
- If that's what you want.
- Are they under arrest?
Coach,we need to speak to them about what happened at that party this evening.
Antrim,murphy-- front and center.
where'd you get these?
Practice.
Hey,come on.Don't play with me,kid.I used to box.I know a fresh strawberry when I see one.
What about you?
At the party,you know?
Just screwing around.
- No big deal.
- Billy raditzer?
Traded a few punches.
Nothing serious.
- Let me see your hands.
- What?
Show me the back of your hands.
You,too,hotshot.
Wouldn't be surprised if the marks on their hands match up pretty good with billy rad's dental work.
Probably left some of their dna on it,too.
Let's go find out,shall we?
Yeah.
Okay.
- Hands behind your back.
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry...
- come on...
they can't do this,can they?
Don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.
Just hang in there.
Against you in the court of law.
If you can't afford an attorney... thought you said they weren't under arrest.
You said that.
I didn'T.
Coach!
Close To Home 2 Episode 6
It was just a stupid fight.
Rad started it.
- And you finished it.
- No,man.
All's we did was tangle, mix it up a little.
He was alive when we left him.
Guaranteed.
- What was the fight about?
- Nothing.He just came in and started swinging.
One minute,I'm doing the party thing, the next minute,rad's in my grille.
Why?
He was pissed.
He lost his starting job to a red shirt.
Red shirt?
I don't even know what that means.
I thought he was all conference.
Twisted his knee first game.
And this other kid-- he's fast.
A lot faster than rad.
Did the 60 in something sick,just blazed.
Rad's been riding the pine and on the rag ever since.
Okay,but what's his beef with you?
Don't know.
Anybody see the fight?
Any witnesses?
No,man.
Not as far as I know.
It was just the three of us up in there,man.
Nobody saw you take it outside?
Everybody else was inside having a good time.
It was done in a minute,no big deal.
So you and gary left rad by the pool?
He was fine.
- You guys really put a beating on him.
- He gave as good as he got.
Obviously.
After the fight?
We just walked away.
Had a beer,and he split.
We went back to the dorm.
I'd like to call my dad now.
So he can get me a lawyer.
A lawyer.
Please.
They obviously had time to get their stories straight.
Yeah,according to the cops, so did everyone else at the party.
Rad stormed into that room,looking for a fight,and that's all anybody knows.
We'll have to reinterview everyone.
Ed and ray can start with the players.
I'll contact the girls.
- I'll go talk to the coroner.
- What about antrim and murphy?
As far as I'm concerned, they can cool their heels until their arraignment.
That gives us 72 hours.
Maybe if we can keep them out of circulation for that long, we can get somebody to tell us something new.
Yeah.
Give me the headlines.
Tommy murphy,gary antrim and billy raditzer had a fight.
We know that.
Well,this confirms it.
Murphy and antrim left their dna all over the hotel and on billy raditzer's knuckles.
And he returned the favor.
- No surprises?
- Just one.
Traces of someone else's blood in that bedroom.
- Not one of the players?
- No.
Fairly fresh, but no way to tell exactly when it was left.
Either before, during or after the party.
Sorry.
Cause of death?
No surprises there,either.
He was beaten so severely, his spleen ruptured.
Bled to death internally.
How long did that take?
Mm,hard to say, but it wasn't instantaneous.
So,if he would have gotten medical attention... you mean if someone had called an ambulance?
Yeah,he should have made it.
Why didn't he get help?
Could he have been unconscious?
Not initially.
No significant head trauma.
His scalp wound was bloody,but superficial.
Maybe he was disoriented.
He'd been drinking,right?
No.
No drugs.
No alcohol.
Billy raditzer was stone cold sober that night.
man:
I was wasted,dude.
I saw rad go in there with gary and tommy.
I was making out in the other room.
I didn't seen anybody come out.
They must have went through the patio doors.
Rad always was a hothead,dude.
Big time anger management issues.
All right,thanks.
Hell with this.
Let's go talk to the head man himself.
You got it.
all my players' full cooperation.
Anything you guys need.
Appreciate that,coach.
so far,we haven't had much luck.
Well,I can tell you this.
Antrim and murphy have been officially suspended from the team indefinitely.
Hut,hut.
They're in custody,coach.
they're not going to play this saturday anyway.
Yeah,I heard they'd be out by midweek.
Heard that,too,on sports radio.
It's not gonna happen.
When I took over the program, they hadn't had a winning season for five years.
I rebuilt it from the ground up.
I won't have its reputation tarnished.
I'm taking disciplinary action against any players who broke training rules that night.
so,you're gonna suspend the whole team?
Not necessary.
Just a few bad apples.
That's what they always say.
Murphy and antrim told us rad started the fight, and they didn't know why, except that he was upset.
Because he lost his starting position.
The story we're getting from everybody is that rad was A... a sore head.
A malcontent.
He had a chip on his shoulder the size of the hoosier dome.
Look,rad got hurt.
He lost his spot.
He thought it wasn't fair.
I can understand that.
Look,if you can excuse me, guys,I got a practice to run, a game to get ready for, and a conference title to win.
Without murphy and antrim.
Well,one thing i don't do is quit.
We're going to a bowl this year.
I guaranteed that on picture day.
Full access,gentlemen.
You've got my word.
Clearly,there's been a concerted effort by coach bass, his team and their supporters to spin this story in a certain direction.
Everyone we've talked to¡ª the players,their girlfriends.
What we need are witnesses who actually saw what happened.
Right now,we have a dead kid and a so-so battery case against a couple of local heroes.
So,the question is, can we prove that this was anything more than just a drunken fistfight between a bunch of jocks?
According to the coroner, billy raditzer was absolutely sober.
Yeah,this was no ordinary, boys-will-be-idiots dustup.
They beat him up so badly, his spleen ruptured.
There's still going to be a lot of pressure to allow them to plea to a lesser charge.
Battery's just a slap on the wrist.
I don't disagree.
All right,look,we charge antrim and murphy with involuntary manslaughter.
Are you sure?
Billy raditzer is dead,antrim and murphy killed him, if this was a barroom brawl between a couple of local yahoos,nobody would think twice,right?
And one last thing:
Football program is not on trial here.
Let's try to remember that as we proceed.
A few bad apples.
That's the working theory.
And you better put your rain gear on, 'cause things are gonna get nasty when this hits the fan.
Annabeth.
Doug.What are you doing here?
Busman's holiday?
I've just come to watch you work.
At an arraignment.
Why don't i believe you?
Because you're cynical and suspicious beyond your years.
And?
And I'm representing tommy murphy.
I see.
- So where are your colleagues?
- What,you don't think i can handle it on my own?
No,I think you're more than capable.
But given the high profile and political sensitivity of this case,I thought... conlon didn't want to add to the hype and hysteria.
Well,he's a wise man.
And ambitious.
Staying as far away from this one as he can.
I just hope,for your sake, that he isn't underestimating the importance of this case for the people of this city and state.
After you,counselor.
Gary antrim and thomas murphy, you are each charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter in the death of william raditzer.
How do you plead?
Mr.Antrim?
Not guilty,your honor.
Mr.Murphy?
Not guilty,your honor.
Ms.Chase,I assume the people have a position on bail that they'd like to convey.
People ask the defendants be held on bond of $1 million apiece.
A million dollars?
The people can't be serious,your honor.
These young men are hardly a threat to the community.
We ask that they be released on their own recognizance.
Now the defense is being frivolous.
Further,if the accused are released on bond, we ask that they be placed under house arrest and fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet to assure their appearance at trial.
Mr.Antrim and mr.Murphy are not flight risks,your honor.
They have substantial ties to the university, as well as a compelling interest in refuting these charges, repairing their reputations and continuing their education.
Bail is set at $500,000 each,cash or bond.
Defendants will submit to mandatory electronic monitoring.
I'm also,given the intense media attention around this case,issuing a gag order.
None of you are to talk to the press.
- Do you understand?
- Yes,your honor.
- Yes,your honor.
- Yes,your honor.
- I think we're done here.
- Your honor,if I may.
Under our system,a defendant is presumed innocent.
We would like to ask the court to issue an injunction to compel central indiana state university to allow these young men to resume all their activities.
Counsel's asking the defendants be allowed to play football while under indictment for manslaughter?
And go to class.
Your honor,the defendants have been suspended by their team.
It's an internal university matter.
I agree with the people.
It's the university's call.
No,injunction from me,miss richter.
Adjourned.
uh,we might be open to a plea.
Gary and tommy want to get on with their lives.
It's too bad billy can'T.
Battery,two years suspended.
Community service.
Get back to me when you're serious.
We'll put tommy and gary on the stand.
Billy raditzer started the fight, it was self-defense.
Their word against...
who?
Do you have any witnesses?
Nice to see you,roberta.
Annabeth,really,we should sit down, work out an amenable compromise here.
You and doug don't come cheap.
I'm just curious-- who's picking up your tab?
as much as I love doug hellman,and respect him, my obligation is to my client.
You're willing to cut a separate deal.
So what makes gary different from tommy?
Why should I cut a deal with him?
The fight was between tommy and billy.
Gary was just caught up in it.
Does doug know what you're up to?
Have a great day.
It's worth a conversation,absolutely.
If we can get antrim to testify against murphy, drive a wedge between them...
- I'll set it up.
- Oh,there's no rush.
Let's see what kind of cards they're holding when we sit down at the table,all right?
Mr. Raditzer's here to see you.
I put him in the small conference room.
Thanks,denise.
This is the third time I've been to indianapolis.
We came last year for,uh,homecoming, billy's mother and I,and... and once when billy was recruited,of course.
Your wife didn't come with you this time?
No,she stayed home.
Make the arrangements.
We're very,very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
You know,now we wish we'd come to see more of his games.
His mother and I hoped he'd go someplace closer to home.
But,you know,you go where the scholarship is.
And that coach,he promised billy that he'd be a starter for central right away.
He was.
till he got hurt.
So you've met coach bass.
Oh,yeah,when he recruited billy.
Sat at our dinner table, and he told us he'd take care of our son.
And we believed him.
We felt good about sending billy here.
His teammates are all saying the same thing.
The fight started because billy was upset about being benched.
Maybe he was,but I don't see him lashing out over it.
He'd have... he'd have just worked harder to get his job back.
Did he ever mention having any problems with gary antrim or tommy murphy?
The boys that killed him?
No.
Never.
Billy-- he got along with everyone.
That's not what we're hearing,sir.
Uh...did billy have any friends who weren't on the team?
um...
his roommate.
Um,nice kid.
Uh,sam something,uh,malloy.
Billy was a stand-up individual.
Kind of straitlaced,though.
Old-fashioned.
Didn't fight,didn't drink, didn't like the way the players treated the girls.
Once a girl's good to go,she's sort of passed around like a party favor.
How do the girls feel about it?
Some of them seem cool with it.
Some of them just go along, get caught up in it.
But it must wear on them after awhile.
Why did rad care?
Why didn't he just ignore it?
Rad had a crush on one of them.
- What was her name?
- Cindy robinson.
All rad did was complain about the whole party scene.
Just bothered him.
I told him,keep his mouth shut.
The coaches pegged you as a troublemaker, you find yourself on the bench, which is exactly what happened.
Don't rock the boat,no matter what.
Go along to get along.
Is that what the fight was about,then?
Jealousy over cindy?
I wasn't there.
Players only.
But best guess,knowing rad, maybe cindy was doing her crimson girl thing, and rad took exception.
- Her crimson girl thing?
- Cindy was a crimson girl.
- And what's that,a cheerleader?
- Without the pom-poms.
They're there to service the players, in every sense of the word.
- So the fight was over a girl.
- Possibly.
Well,that's a motive I can understand.
Now,the,uh,crimson girls.
We confirmed malloy's story.
They show recruits around campus.
Ah,persuade them to sign with central.
Plus,they're a little perk for the varsity players.
You know, anything they can do to help the team.
The behavior was shocking enough, but the blas?
attitude...
I know-- it's a complete moral vacuum.
They don't see anything wrong with it.
Oh,uh,you were right,by the way.
About antrim and murphy.
Someone is picking up the tab for their attorney and their bail bonds.
The football booster club.
It's amazing how much support there is for these guys in the community.
And how little there is for the victim.
That's why we do what we do, so the victim is not forgotten.
You know,it's none of my business, but you're killing yourself with those french fries.
You should talk.
You smoke cigars.
But I'm a triathlete.
It counteracts the effects of the cigar.
Jim,annabeth.
This is oliver kent,the president of central indiana state university.
This is our new chief deputy prosecutor,james conlon.
- It's a pleasure.
- Mr. Kent.
And I believe you already know annabeth.
Oh,yes,we've met.Mr.Conlon,it's good to see you, considering the circumstances.
Well,we hope to resolve this in an equitable manner for all involved.
Spoken like a fair-minded public servant.
I expected no less.
The university has always had excellent relations with the legal establishment in indianapolis.
As a matter of fact,your predecessor was a season ticket holder.
Big snappers fan.
He really knew how to throw a mean tailgate party.
I don't suppose they tailgate in new york.
Well,you know,doug, this may come as a surprise to you, but we play football in new york¡ª tailgate,too.
When all this is over,mr.Conlon, I hope you'll be my guest at a home game.
You,too,miss chase.
Well,we'll let you get back to your lunch.
Come on.
Bye.
Gentlemen.
Was that a bribe?
Well,if it was,they'll have to do a hell of a lot better than a couple of seats on the 50 yard line.
What was I talking about?
Oh,uh,cindy robinson.
Maureen's talking to her today.
Soon as we know what she has, we'll sit down with antrim and his attorney.
Will do.
What are you gonna do?
Well,I'm going to return some nasty phone calls from the news media, fend off demands for my resignation and answer some hate mail.
That's why you make the big bucks.
I understand you're a crimson girl.
So?
- What exactly is that?
- We just do things for the team.
You know,whatever they need¡ª show recruits around campus,and tutor.
You tutor players?
If they need help,you know,with, like,tests and stuff.
It's a little bit more than that,isn't it,cindy?
- What you do for the players.
- That's up to the girl.
Don't the players expect it?
The extra...
service.
No pressure.
We do what we want to do.
What about gary antrim and tommy murphy?
Did they ever ask you for anything extra?
You mean,like,did i ever hook up with them?
Sure,gary and tommy.
Not rad-- he wasn't really my type.
You dated gary and tommy.
- We don't really date on this campus.
- You don't?
I'm a senior-
- I haven't had a date in, like,four years.
We just,hook up,you know, keep it "cas," no strings.
Who were you hooked up with at the party?
Nobody.
I just danced.
- Did you see tommy and gary?
- Once or twice.
It was pretty crowded.
What about rad?
Same thing.
Just to say hey.
- Did you see the fight?
- No.
Nobody did.
Do you know what the fight was about?
Everyone said rad was mad about being benched.
Did you know that the fight might have been about you?
No.
Uh,I didn't-
- I don't,I don't see how it could've been.
Look,I'm sorry,I'm really late for class.
I got to go.
I feel terrible.
This is not me.
This is not who I am.
If you knew he was seriously injured and you walked away and let him die without calling for help...
- We thought he was okay,I swear...
- We will up the charges.
Okay.I thought we were here to down the charges to something more reasonable,annabeth,like battery for instance.
Involuntary manslaughter is as low as we're willing to go.
That's what he's charged with now.
Uh,why are we here?
Sentencing recommendation is still in play.
Tommy murphy is the principally responsible party here.
Well,you have to convince us of that.
- And if we do?
- The maximum.
- Eight years?
No.Annabeth...
He serves four,the rest suspended in exchange for his testimony against his codefendant and a true account of what happened that night.
No more smoke screen,no more spin.
Okay,gary.
Tell them your story.
It was over a girl.
Cindy robinson.
Yeah.
Rad had a thing for her, but she wouldn't give him a tumble.
So he walked into that room looking for you and murphy?
Not us.
Cindy.
- I'm sorry,cindy was in the room?
- Yup.
Did she see the fight?
She saw it start, but we took it outside before it really got going.
Let me get this straight.
Billy raditzer stormed into that room because you and murphy were in there with cindy?
Not us,the guy we hooked her up with that night.
The coroner said there was someone else in the room.
Freddy wade.
He's a booster.
So billy confronted mr.
Wade?
Busted his nose.
Dude bled all over.
What was wade doing there?
I thought the party was players only.
We always got a couple boosters hanging around.
Freddy wanted us to hook him up with a crimson girl.
Nice.
Freddy went in the room with her, cindy just started freaking out.
Said she didn't sign up for that.
But tommy talked her down.
How'd he do that?
Freddy promised her a car.
So everything was cool.
A car?
That's prostitution-- not cool.
- We didn't think of it that way.
- Obviously.Go on.
They were about to get it on and rad busted in.
We traded some punches,no big deal.
Rad said something to tommy.
Tommy just went ape.
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.I didn't hear.
Cindy and big freddy just started freaking out, so we took it outside.
Tommy got rad down on the ground and just started wailing on him.I pulled tommy off.
- How did you leave billy raditzer?
- He seemed okay.He was on his feet.
He had a couple cuts and bruises, but I had no idea he was busted up inside.
Tommy must've done that when he got him down.
So,in light of his candor and his ancillary culpability, in exchange for his testimony against mr.
Murphy,do we have a deal?
We'll have to see if his story checks out.
Does doug hellman know you're here?
Ah...actually,doug prefers complete vindication at trial for his client.
Apparently,mr.
Murphy still harbors a notion that he's gonna play in the nfl.
Good day,ladies.
I feel like we're finally getting to the bottom of this.
And if doug hellman went to trial, it'd get on judge barnez's calendar.
- Who's going to talk to the used car salesman?
- Big freddy.Got it.
Yeah,I was hoping to talk to the crimson girl.
No crimson girls for you.
I'll talk to cindy,since we have such rapport.
I'll come with you.
In a minute,we're gonna take you downtown,get your dna.
Dna's gonna match up to the crime scene, put you right in that room.
- The kid hit me!
- Not to mention the scandal.
Prominent member of the business community forcing himself on coeds.That'll sell a lot of cars.
Come down to wade auto, where you can buy a used car and get raped.
I'm sure your wife will be pleased,too.
Whoa,whoa,whoa,hold on.
Wait,now... what are you saying?
I never had to force myself on a woman.
Antrim and murphy-- they said it was cool.
In fact,they said she wanted to.
Whoa,whoa,whoa.You believe that?
Look in the mirror,pal.
I didn't have anything to do with that raditzer kid dying.
I was out of there long before that even happened.
You-you...
you ask coach bass.
Coach bass was at the party?
I called him.
He came and got me.
Funny.
He neglected to mention that.
Coach was only there to help me.
I didn't want anyone else to know about it.
If the press finds out that he was at that party, it could ruin the program.
You lied to us about being in the room that night.
You can't dodge this any longer,cindy.
The chickens are all coming home to roost.
Antrim told us that rad said something to tommy murphy that night,that made him very angry.
Did you hear what it was?
He said he was going to tell the coach.
Tell the coach about you and mr.
Wade?
Why would coach care about that?
No,he'd think it was so great we were "taking care" of his friend.
No,he meant about murphy and dede.
What are you talking about?
Who's dede?
Mrs. Bass.
Rad said he saw murphy with coach bass' wife.
Tommy murphy and mrs.
Bass were having an affair?
Rad said he saw them one night getting into an elevator at the dunlop.
He said they were all over each other.
Cell phone records confirm frequent contact between tommy murphy and dede bass.
- Murphy even called her the night of the fight.
- Do we know why?
We matched her license plate to the garage security video.
She was there to pick him up.
And we got a positive I.D. From the bellman at the dunlop.
Mrs.Bass and tommy murphy were frequent flyers.
Coach's wife and his star quarterback.
Who said things were dull in indianapolis?
Not I.
- Puts the big apple to shame.
- You've been away too long.
That's the thing about the midwest:
It only looks normal.
What about coach bass?
He never told us or the police he went to the party that night to pick up big freddy.
Big freddy told him about the fight then.
If coach bass knew about the fight,then tried to cover it up by telling his players what to say, that's obstruction of justice.
- It's hard to prove.
On the other hand,if he tells his story under oath,it's perjury.
So who do we talk to first:
The coach or his wife?
Neither,tired of waltzing around with lying,prevaricating witnesses.
So what do you have in mind?
We put them both on the stand under oath,treat them as hostile witnesses in tommy murphy's manslaughter trial.
That could work.
We got a dead player, two others charged with manslaughter.
A prominent booster involved in a possible rape.
We got coach bass,who came to his rescue.
Coeds and boosters involved in what amounts to a prostitution ring.
We've got a hell of a scandal shaping up here.
Big enough to bring down the program.
That worry you?
Let the chips fall where they may.
How long******you had been in the fair with the defendant?
A little more than a year.
Was your husband aware of the affair?
I doubt it.
He's too busy.
He wouldn't have noticed your frequent overnight stays at the dunlop hotel with the defendant?
A lot of nights roy doesn't even come home.
He stays all night in his office watching game film.
The night billy raditzer died,where were you?
At home.
You know,Couldn't go to the party with tommy,obviously.
I was at home all night.
- You never left?
- No.
Did you see the defendant that night?
No.
Did you talk to him on the phone that night?
No.
What about your husband?
Where was he?
At his office,I assume.
Did you see him at all that night?
Well,not until the next morning, after gary and tommy had been arrested.
Did he say anything about what occurred that evening?
Objection,your honor.
Spousal privilege.
The court cannot require mrs.Bass to testify as to confidential communications between her and her husband.
According to indiana statutes, she can answer voluntarily.
Ms. Bass,you may answer the question, if you so choose.
He just said that there'd been a fight.
That tommy and gary had killed billy and it was all a big mess.
He said that?
He put the blame on gary antrim and tommy murphy?
Yes.
I said he had to stand by them.
He said that the boosters would get them good lawyers and that there was nothing he could do.
He said the program had to come first.
With roy,the program always comes first.
Yes,I was at the party.
Briefly.
I went there to help out a friend.
Big freddy wade-- who found himself in a compromising position with a coed.
Well,I wouldn't quite characterize it that way.
You were covering for big freddy wade.
Again,I wouldn't quite... some people might say you were pimping for him.
Your honor,that was unnecessary.
Indeed,ms.
Chase,moderate your rhetoric,please.
I'm sorry,I'm sorry.
I apologize,your honor.
But it's true,isn't it?
You knew all about the connection between the boosters and the crimson girls.
I didn't know anything about any of that.
Freddy called me,said he was in trouble, needed a ride,i went and got him.Ended the story.
790 00:30:55,340 -- 00:30:58,870 You didn't tell the police or prosecutor's office you were at the party.
They never asked.
You didn't think it was your duty to volunteer that information?
I didn't think it was relevant.
None of your players mentioned you were at the party,either.
I didn't see or speak to any of my players.
Freddy met me out at the street.
I didn't go into the hotel.
Did you speak to your players back at the athletic center?
I did.
Did you instruct them on what to tell the police and prosecutors about what happened that night?
I did.
Coercing your players to lie about what happened is obstruction of justice.
- Objection.
- Rephrase,counselor.
What did you tell them to say,coach?
I told them to be consistent.
- To stick to a simple story.
- And what story was that?
That no one knew exactly what happened that night between those three players and that is the truth.
What else?
That billy raditzer was upset about losing his starting position.
Did you tell them to say billy started the fight?
As far as anyone knew,he did.
I didn'T...tell my players to lie to you or the police about anything.
So then why instruct them on what to say?
For the good of the program.
To try to minimize the fallout from this...
tragic event.
According to your wife,you characterized it somewhat differently when you came home.
Well,she misunderstood.
And other than mr.Wade.
you didn't talk to anyone else at that party?
No.
I got in and out as quick as I could.
Why don't you tell us exactly what happened that night,tommy.
Rad was in love with cindy.
He couldn't get it in his head that she wanted to be with other guys.
Go on.
I hooked cindy up with big freddy.
Somehow rad found out about it.
He came in swinging... yelling... the minute he hit big freddy, I knew we had a problem.
- Well,you could've walked away.
- I wish I had.
He kept running his mouth about big freddy and cindy.
All I could think about was, "he's going to ruin everything.
Then he said that... he knew about me and the coach's wife.
Next thing I knew,we were outside rolling around on the ground.
And then what happened?
Antrim pulled me off, told me we had to get out of there.
Well,why didn't you try to get medical assistance for rad or call for help?
He seemed fine.
I am sorry for what I did.
I'm sorry rad's dead.
I wish I could turn back the clock.
Start over.
Nothing further.
If that's true,mr.Murphy, why have you remained silent for so long?
I thought,somehow,it might still all work out.
If you kept your mouth shut, you might evade criminal prosecution and resume your athletic career?
Yes.
Earlier,we heard gary antrim's testimony.
You beat billy raditzer savagely, without mercy,within an inch of his life.
I didn'T...
I swear.
We left him alive.
After the fight, you and gary went back to the dorm.
And then what did you do?
Just hung around.
I didn't really think anything about it until coach called us all together.
You didn't return to the hotel?
Mrs.Bass said,earlier,she hadn't been to the hotel and hadn't seen or talked to you that night.
Your honor,people's exhibit 22 and 23:
Hotel garage security video, which records the entrance of a vehicle registered to dede bass about the same time as billy raditzer's death and cell phone records of calls that night between the defendant and mrs.Bass.
The last call,ten minutes before mrs.
Bass's car arrived at the garage.
Would you care to revise your statement?
I was worried.
I went back to the hotel to see if rad was okay.
And did you find him?
Yes.
I could see him with someone by the pool.
Who?
Tommy it's time to stop protecting someone you know has lied to protect himself.Not you.
Your honor,counsel is either testifying or giving her closing statement.
- I can't tell which.
- Ask a question,ms.
Chase.
Tommy,who did you see with billy raditzer?
Coach bass.
The court will come to order or the bailiffs will clear the room.
What exactly did you see?
They were talking.
Arguing.
I could hear their voices.
They were kind of raised.
I...
I thought billy was telling coach about the fight.
Me and antrim were in big trouble.
Billy was sitting in a chair.
Coach was standing over him, looking into his eyes.
With his hands on his shoulders.
- Holding him down?
- Yes.
- And then what?
- Billy tried to get up out of his chair.
Coach wouldn't let him.
He just kept holding him down.
Billy kept trying to get up out of his chair.
He kept saying, "please,help me-
- I'm dying.
Please,I need a doctor.
Coach just kept holding him down.
It was terrible.
And then... billy just... closed his eyes and kind of slumped over.
Coach let him go and he just toppled over onto the ground.
- What did you do?
- I got the hell out of there.
I called dede and esther, if she could come pick me up.
Tommy,why didn't you call for help?
I could tell he was dead.
And did you see the coach at all,after that?
Back at the athletic center.
He said billy had died in the fight.
He said no one knew the circumstances.
He took me aside.
He said,"keep your mouth shut."
"You'll still go to the nfl."
your honor,the defense asks for a brief recess.
Granted.
now,I'm thinking we should,uh, withdraw our not guilty plea.
Same deal as antrim?
He does more time.
- Four years.
- All eight.
Results of the search warrant.
Billy raditzer's blood in your car.
That might've been left by big freddy wade.
And on items of clothing found on your premises.
It all corroborates tommy murphy's story.
The university's already cooperating with the ncaa.
Over 60 police reports ranging from assault to rape allegations.
Reports actively suppressed by you and your staff with the cooperation of the entire athletic department and the campus police.
Handgun possession, sexual misconduct,dui,battery.
Not to mention the crimson girls, whom the boosters actively pay to provide sexual favors to athletes and boosters, which,in most jurisdictions,is prostitution.
Your football program's going to get the so-called death penalty-- it's too bad we couldn't do the same for you.
What are you offering?
In exchange for a full confession,he pleads guilty to voluntary manslaughter.
- Jail time?
- Maximum: 20 years.
Murphy's got eight,antrim four.
He's more culpable than they are.
He knew billy raditzer needed help.
The good samaritan law doesn't oblige anyone to aid an injured person.
He forcibly prevented billy raditzer from getting medical assistance.
He wanted him to die and he made sure that he did.
Make your statement.
He threatened to go public.
Tell everybody.
Not just about the affair but about the crimson girls and big freddy and anything else he could think about.
I mean,here is this 18-year-old kid shooting off his mouth... without any sense of what it would do to the program-
- I program I built from nothing.
- Coach.
- Shut up!
I gave this kid a scholarship.
This ungrateful son of a bitch-- and now he wants to drag me and my program through the coals?
and my program through the coals?
Make A...
a laughingstock out of us.
Boy,you got what you wanted to didn't you?
Yeah,the program will be dismantled.
My legacy,all of it-- gone.
Your legacy?
You left billy raditzer to die because you cared more about the program than your players.
- That's your legacy.
- Yeah.
Coach.
If he hadn't tried to cover it up...
antrim and murphy would've taken the blame.
And coach bass would still be sitting in the catbird seat.
You know,it's usually the cover-up and not the original crime that trips up the high and mighty in these kind of cases.
And now,you're going to be known as the guy who killed football at central indiana.
Nah,they'll be off probation in a few years and back in a bowl game before you know it.
Still,you didn't have to take the lead on this.
We could've been the public face of the prosecutor's office.
Well,then I'd be as bad as coach bass letting my players take the heat.
Which reminds me, gene raditzer called to say thank you.
Well,the least we could do-- putting coach bass in prison hardly compensates for the loss of his son,though.
No,but he was ecstatic about the scholarship.
Scholarship?
I didn't tell you?
My new friend,president kent.
I persuaded him to establish one in billy's memory.
The raditzer scholarship.
For true student athletes or good moral character.
Persuaded?
Oh,I can twist an arm when I need to.
Close To Home 2 Episode 6
Sammy!
Take your brother outside as fast as you can!
Go!
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.
This is dad's book.
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off -
Saving people, hunting things, the family business.
I got to find dad.
It's the only think I can think about.
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the lord my soul to keep.
Thy angels watch me through the night
And keep me safe till morning light.
Amen.
Night, monkeypuss.
Daddy?
Is mommy coming home?
No, honey.
She's spending the night at the hospital with your sister.
Hey.
You sleep tight now.
Yeah, you probably missed something.
Dude, I ran lexisnexis, local police reports,
Newspapers
- I couldn't find a single red flag.
Are you sure you got the coordinates right?
Yeah, I double-checked.
It's Fitchberg, Wisconsin.
Dad wouldn't have sent us coordinates
If it wasn't important, Sammy.
Well, I'm telling you, I looked,
And all I could find was a big, steamy pile of nothing.
If dad's sending us hunting for something,
I don't know what.
Well, maybe he's gonna meet us there.
Yeah, 'cause he's been so easy to find up to this point.
You're a real smartass, you know that?
Don't worry.
I'm sure there's something in Fitchberg worth killing.
Yeah?
What makes you so sure?
Because I'm the oldest, which means I'm always right.
No, it doesn't.
It totally does.
Well, the waitress thinks
That the local freemasons are up to something sneaky,
But other than that,
Nobody's heard about anything weird going on.
Dean, you got the time?
10 after 4:00.
Why?
What's wrong with this picture?
School's out, isn't it?
Yeah.
So where is everybody?
This place should be crawling with kids right now.
It sure is quiet out here.
Yeah, it's a shame.
Why is that?
You know, kids getting sick.
It's a terrible thing.
How many?
Just five or six, but serious, hospital serious.
A lot of parents are getting pretty anxious.
They think it's catching.
Dude, dude, I am not using this I.D.
Why not?
Because it says "bikini inspector" on it.
Don't worry.
She won't look that close.
Hell, she won't even ask to see it.
It's all about confidence, Sammy.
Hi.
I'm dr.
Jerry Kaplan, center for disease control.
Can I see some I.D.?
Yeah, of course.
Now, could you direct me to the pediatrics ward?
Okay, just go down that hall, turn left, up the stairs.
You'll see them.
Right.
Thank you.
See?
Told you it would work.
Follow me.
It's upstairs.
Dean.
Thanks for seeing us, dr.
Hydaker.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are here.
I was just about to call the CDC myself.
How did you find out anyway?
Oh, some G.P. I forget his name -
He called atlanta and must have beat you to the punch.
So you say you got six cases so far?
Yeah, in five weeks.
At first I thought it was bacterial pneumonia,
Not that newsworthy.
But now...
Now, what?
The kids aren't responding to antibiotics.
Their white-cell counts keep going down.
Their immune systems just aren't doing their job.
It's like their bodies are wearing out.
Excuse me, dr.
Hydaker.
You ever see anything like this before?
Never this severe.
The way it spreads
- That's a new one for me.
What do you mean?
It works its way through families,
But only the children, one sibling after another.
You mind if we interview a few of the kids?
They're not conscious.
None of them?
No.
Can we talk to the parents?
If you think it'll help.
Yeah, yeah.
Who was your most recent admission?
I should get back to my girls.
We understand that,
And we really appreciate you talking to us.
Now, you say Mary's the oldest?
13.
Okay, and she came down with it first, right?
And then...
Bethany the next night.
Within 24 hours?
I guess.
Look, I already went through all this with the doctor.
Right.
Just a few more questions, if you don't mind.
How do you think they caught pneumonia?
Were they out in the cold, anything like that?
No, we think it was an open window.
Both times?
The first time, I don't really remember,
But the second time for sure,
And I know I closed it before I put Bethany to bed.
So you think she opened it?
It's a second-story window, no ledge.
No one else could have.
You know this might not be anything supernatural.
It might just be pneumonia.
Maybe.
Or maybe something opened that window.
I don't know, man.
Look, dad sent us down here for a reason.
I think we might be barking up the right tree.
I'll tell you one thing.
What?
That guy we just talked to -
I'm betting it'll be a while before he goes home.
You got anything over there?
No, nothing.
Yeah, me neither.
Hey, Dean.
Yeah?
You were right.
It's not pneumonia.
It's rotted.
What the hell leaves a handprint like that?
Cheetara.
I am sorry to wake you,
But Jaga bids me to bring you to him.
All right.
You know the drill, Dean.
If anyone calls, you don't pick up.
If it's me, I'll ring once and then call back.
You got that?
Don't answer the phone unless it rings once first.
Come on, dude.
Look alive.
This stuff's important.
I know, it's just,
We've done it like a million times,
And you know I'm not stupid.
I know you're not, but it only takes one mistake.
You got that?
It's important that he join Jaga on the flight deck.
All right, if I'm not back sunday night...
Call pastor Jim.
Lock the doors and windows, close the shades,
And most important -
Watch out for Sammy.
Responsible for lion-O's welfare, snarf is.
I know.
All right, if something tries to bust in...
Shoot first, ask questions later.
That's my man.
What's up, Jaga?
Come closer.
What's happening to her?
What was that?
I know why dad sent us here.
He's faced this thing before.
He wants us to finish the job.
So what the hell is a shtriga?
It's kind of like a witch, I think.
I don't know much about them.
Well, I've never heard of it,
And it's not in dad's journal.
Dad hunted one in Fort Douglas, Wisconsin,
About 16, 17 years ago.
You were there.
You don't remember?
No.
I guess he caught wind that the thing's in Fitchberg now
And kicked us the coordinates.
So wait, this... shtriga.
Right, you think it's the same one dad hunted before?
Yeah, maybe.
If dad went after it, why is it still breathing air?
Because it got away.
Got away?
Yeah, Sammy, it happens.
Not very often.
I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe dad didn't have his wheaties that morning.
What else do you remember?
Nothing.
I was a kid, all right?
King or two queens?
Two queens.
Yeah, I bet.
What'd you say?
Nice car.
Hi.
Checking in?
Yeah.
Uh, do me a favor.
Go get your brother some dinner.
I'm helping a guest.
Two queens.
Funny kid.
Oh, yeah, he thinks so.
Will that be cash or credit?
Do you take mastercard?
Perfect.
There you go.
Thank you.
When's dad gonna get back?
Tomorrow.
When?
I don't know.
He usually comes in late, though.
Now, eat your dinner.
I'm sick of "scabetti-Os."
Well, you're the one who wanted them.
I want lucky charms.
There's no more lucky charms.
I saw the box.
Okay, maybe there is,
But there's only enough left for one bowl,
And I haven't had any yet.
Do you want the prize?
Sir?
Thanks.
Well, you were right.
It wasn't very easy to find, but you were right.
A shtriga is a kind of witch.
They're albanian,
But legends about them date back to ancient rome.
They feed off of spiritus vitae.
Spirit what?
Vitae.
It's latin.
It translates to "breath of life,"
Kind of like your life force or essence.
Didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies were wearing out?
It's a thought.
You know, she takes your vitality,
Maybe your immunity goes to hell, pneumonia takes hold.
Anyway, shtrigas can feed off anyone, but they prefer -
Children.
Yeah.
Probably because they have stronger life force.
And get this
- Shtrigas are invulnerable
To all weapons devised by god and man.
No, that's not right.
She's vulnerable when she feeds.
What?
If you catch her when she's eating,
You can blast her with consecrated wrought irons,
Buckshots or rounds I think.
How do you know that?
Dad told me.
I remember.
Oh.
So, uh, anything else dad might have mentioned?
No, that's it.
What?
Nothing.
Okay, so, assuming we can kill it when it eats,
We've still got to find the thing first,
Which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.
Shtrigas take on a human disguise when they're not hunting.
What kind of human disguise?
Historically, something innocuous.
It could be anything, but it's usually a feeble old woman,
Which may be how the witches-as-old-crones legend got started.
Hang on.
What?
Check this out.
I marked down all the addresses of the victims.
Now, these are the houses that have been hit so far,
And dead center -
The hospital.
When we were there, I saw a patient, an old woman.
An old person, huh?
Yeah.
In the hospital?
Whew!
Better call the coast guard.
Well, listen, smartass,
She had an inverted cross hanging on her wall.
Good night, dr.
Hydaker.
See you tomorrow, Betty.
Try to get some sleep, Aaron.
Come on.
Who the hell are you?
Who's there?
You trying to steal my stuff?
They're always stealing around here.
No, ma'am, we're maintenance.
We're sorry.
We thought you were sleeping.
Ah, nonsense.
I was sleeping with my peepers open.
And fix that crucifix, would you?
I've asked four damn times already.
"I was sleeping with my peepers open."
I almost smoked that old gal, I swear.
It's not funny.
Oh, man, you should have seen your face, Dean.
Oh, yeah, laugh it on, man.
We're back to square one.
Hang on.
Hey, what's wrong?
My brother's sick.
The little guy?
Pneumonia.
He's in the hospital.
It's my fault.
No, come on.
How?
I should have made sure the window was latched.
He wouldn't have gotten pneumonia
If the window was latched.
Listen to me.
I can promise you that this is not your fault, okay?
It's my job to look after him.
Michael.
Turn on the "no vacancy" sign while I'm gone.
I've got Denise covering room service,
So don't bother with the rooms.
I'm going with you.
Not now, Michael.
But I got to see Asher.
Hey, Michael.
Hey.
I know how you feel.
I'm a big brother, too.
But you got to go easy on your mom right now, okay?
Aw, damn it.
I got it.
Thanks.
You're in no condition to drive.
Why don't you let me give you a lift to the hospital?
No, no, I couldn't possibly -
No, no trouble.
I insist.
Be good.
We're gonna kill this thing.
I want it dead.
You hear me?
Hey.
Hey, how's the kid?
He's not good.
Where you at?
I'm at the library,
Trying to find out as much as I can about this shtriga.
Yeah, what do you got?
Well, bad news.
I started with Fort Douglas
Around the time you said dad was there.
And?
Same deal.
Before that, there was Ogdenville.
Before that, North Haverbrook and Brockway.
Every 15 to 20 years, it hits a new town.
Dean, this thing is just getting started in Fitchberg.
In all these other places, it goes on for months,
Dozens of kids, before the shtriga finally moves on.
Kids just languish in comas, and then they die.
How far back does this thing go?
I don't know.
The earliest mention i could find is this place
Called Black River Falls back in the 1890s.
Talk about a horror show.
Whoa.
Sam?
Hold on.
I'm looking at a photograph right now
Of a bunch of doctors standing around a kid's bed.
One of the doctors is Hydaker.
And?
And this picture was taken in 1893.
You sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.
Don't worry.
Your son's in good hands.
I'm gonna take care of him.
So what's the CDC come up with so far?
We're still working on a few theories.
You'll know something as soon as we do.
Well, nothing's more important to me than these kids.
Hmm.
Just let me know if I can help.
I'll do that.
We should have thought of this before.
Doctor's a perfect disguise.
You're trusted.
You can control the whole thing.
Huh.
That son of a bitch.
I'm surprised you didn't draw on him right there.
Yeah, well...
First of all,
I'm not gonna open fire in a freakin' pediatrics ward.
Good call.
Second, it wouldn't have done any good
Because the bastard's bulletproof
Unless he's chowing down on something.
And third, I wasn't packing,
Which is probably a really good thing
'Cause I probably would have just burned a clip in him
Off of principle alone.
You're getting wise in your old age, Dean.
You're damn right.
'Cause now I know how we're gonna get it.
What do you mean?
The shtriga
- It works through siblings, right?
Right.
Well, last night...
It went after Asher.
Tonight it's probably gonna come after Michael.
Then we got to get him out of here.
No.
No, that would blow the whole deal.
What?
Yeah.
Then you want to use the kid as bait?
Are you nuts?
No.
Forget it.
That's out of the question.
Sam, it's the only way
- If this thing disappears,
It could be years before we get another chance.
Michael's a kid, and I'm not gonna dangle him
In front of that thing like a worm on a hook.
Dad did not send me here to walk away.
Send you here?
He didn't send you here.
He sent us here.
This isn't about you, Sam.
I'm the one that screwed up.
It's my fault.
There's no telling how many kids have gotten hurt
Because of me.
What are you saying, Dean?
How is it your fault?
Dean.
You've been hiding something from the get-go.
Since when does dad bail on a hunt?
Since when does he let something get away?
Now, talk to me, man.
Tell me what's going on.
Fort Douglas, Wisconsin.
It was the third night in this crap room,
And I was climbing the walls, man.
I needed to get some air.
...if ever I saw one.
Command performance.
Hey, kid.
We're closing up.
Get out of the way!
Sammy.
Sammy.
Sammy.
You okay?
Dad, what's going on?
Are you all right?
What happened?
I-I just went out.
What?
J-Just for a second.
I'm sorry.
I told you not to leave this room.
I told you not to let him out of your sight.
Dad just grabbed us and booked,
Dropped us off at pastor Jim's about three hours away.
By the time he got back to Fort Douglas,
The shtriga had disappeared.
It was just gone.
It never resurfaced until now.
Dad never spoke about it again.
I didn't ask.
But he, uh...
He looked at me different, you know, which was worse.
Not that I blame him.
He gave me an order, and I didn't listen,
And I almost got you killed.
You were just a kid.
Don't.
Dad knew this was unfinished business for me.
He sent me here to finish it.
But using Michael
- I don't know, Dean.
I mean, how about one of us hides under the cover?
You know, we'll be the bait.
No, that won't work.
It's got to get close enough to feed.
It'll see us.
Believe me, I don't like it, but it's got to be the kid.
You're crazy!
Just go away or I'm calling the cops.
Hang on a second.
Just listen to me.
You have to believe me, okay?
This thing came through the window
And attacked your brother.
I've seen it.
I know what it looks like
'Cause it attacked my brother once, too.
This thing -
Is it, like...
It has this long, black robe?
You saw it last night, didn't you?
I thought I was having a nightmare.
I'd give anything not to tell you this,
But sometimes nightmares are real.
So why are you telling me?
Because we need your help.
My help?
We can kill it, me and him.
It's what we do.
But we can't do it without you.
What?
No.
Michael, listen to me.
This thing hurt Asher,
And it's gonna keep hurting kids unless we stop it.
Do you understand me?
Well, that went crappy.
Now what?
What did you expect?
You can't ask an adult to do something like that,
Much less a kid.
If you kill it, will Asher get better?
Honestly, we don't know.
You said you're a big brother.
Yeah.
You'd take care of your little brother?
You'd do anything for him?
Yeah, I would.
Me too.
I'll help.
This camera has night vision on it,
So we'll be able to see you as clear as day.
Are we good?
Hair to the right.
There, there.
What do I do?
Just stay under the covers.
And if it shows up?
Well, we'll be right in the next room.
We're gonna come in with guns, so as soon as we do,
You roll off this bed and you crawl under it.
What if you shoot me?
We won't shoot you.
We're good shots.
We're not gonna fire until you're clear, okay?
Have you heard a gunshot before?
Like in the movies?
It's gonna be a lot louder than in the movies.
So I want you to stay under the bed, cover your ears,
And do not come out until we say so, you understand?
Michael, are you sure you want to do this?
You don't have to.
It's okay.
I won't be mad.
No, I'm okay.
Just don't shoot me.
We're not gonna let anything happen to you.
I promise.
What time is it?
3:00.
You sure these iron rounds are gonna work?
Consecrated iron rounds.
And yeah, it's what dad used last time.
Hey, Dean, I'm sorry.
For what?
You know...
I've really given you a lot of crap
For always following dad's orders,
But I know why you do it.
Oh, god.
Kill me now.
Wait, look.
Now?
Not yet.
Michael, down!
Mike, you all right?
Yeah.
Just sit tight.
Dean!
Hey!
You okay, little brother?
It's okay, Michael.
You can come on out.
Hey, Joanna, how's Asher doing?
Have you seen Michael?
Mom!
Mom!
Hey!
How's Ash?
I've got some good news.
Your brother's gonna be fine.
Really?
Yeah, really.
No one can explain it.
It's, uh, it's a miracle.
They're gonna keep him in overnight for observation,
But after that, he's coming home.
That's great.
How are all the other kids doing?
Good, real good.
A bunch of them should be checking out in a few days.
Dr. Travis says the ward's gonna be like a ghost town.
Dr. Travis?
What about dr.
Hydaker?
Oh, he wasn't in today.
He must have been sick or something.
Yeah, yeah, must have.
So did anything happen while I was gone?
No, same old stuff.
Okay.
You can go see Ash.
Now?
Only if you want to.
I better get going
Before he hot-wires the car and drives himself.
It's too bad.
No, they'll be fine.
That's not what I meant.
I meant Michael.
He'll always know there are things out there in the dark.
He'll never be the same, you know?
Sometimes I wish that...
What?
I wish I could have that kind of innocence.
If it means anything, sometimes I wish you could, too.
Sammy!
Take your brother outside as fast as you can!
Go!
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.
This is dad's book.
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off -
Saving people, hunting things, the family business.
I got to find dad.
It's the only think i can think about.
Bethany: now i lay me down to sleep.
I pray the lord my soul to keep.
Thy angels watch me through the night
And keep me safe till morning light.
Amen.
Night, monkeypuss.
Daddy?
Is mommy coming home?
No, honey.
She's spending the night at the hospital with your sister.
Hey.
You sleep tight now.
Dean: yeah, you probably missed something.
Dude, i ran lexisnexis, local police reports,
Newspapers
- I couldn't find a single red flag.
Are you sure you got the coordinates right?
Yeah, i double-Checked.
It's fitchburg, wisconsin.
Dad wouldn't have sent us coordinates
If it wasn't important, sammy.
Well, i'm telling you, i looked,
And all i could find was a big, steamy pile of nothing.
If dad's sending us hunting for something,
I don't know what.
Well, maybe he's gonna meet us there.
Yeah, 'cause he's been so easy to find up to this point.
You're a real smartass, you know that?
Don't worry.
I'm sure there's something in fitchburg worth killing.
Yeah?
What makes you so sure?
Because i'm the oldest, which means i'm always right.
No, it doesn't.
It totally does.
Well, the waitress thinks
That the local freemasons are up to something sneaky,
But other than that,
Nobody's heard about anything weird going on.
Dean, you got the time?
10 after 4:00.
Why?
What's wrong with this picture?
School's out, isn't it?
Yeah.
So where is everybody?
This place should be crawling with kids right now.
It sure is quiet out here.
Yeah, it's a shame.
Why is that?
You know, kids getting sick.
It's a terrible thing.
How many?
Just five or six, but serious, hospital serious.
A lot of parents are getting pretty anxious.
They think it's catching.
Dude, dude, i am not using this i.D.
Why not?
Because it says "bikini inspector" on it.
Don't worry.
She won't look that close.
Hell, she won't even ask to see it.
It's all about confidence, sammy.
Hi.
I'm dr.
Jerry kaplan, center for disease control.
Can i see some i.D.?
Yeah, of course.
Now, could you direct me to the pediatrics ward?
Okay, just go down that hall, turn left, up the stairs.
You'll see them.
Right.
Thank you.
See?
Told you it would work.
Follow me.
It's upstairs.
Sam: dean.
Thanks for seeing us, dr.
Hydaker.
Oh, i'm glad you guys are here.
I was just about to call the cdc myself.
How did you find out anyway?
Oh, some g.P.
- I forget his name -
He called atlanta and must have beat you to the punch.
So you say you got six cases so far?
Yeah, in five weeks.
At first i thought it was bacterial pneumonia,
Not that newsworthy.
But now...
Now, what?
The kids aren't responding to antibiotics.
Their white-Cell counts keep going down.
Their immune systems just aren't doing their job.
It's like their bodies are wearing out.
Betty: excuse me, dr.
Hydaker.
You ever see anything like this before?
Never this severe.
The way it spreads
- That's a new one for me.
What do you mean?
It works its way through families,
But only the children, one sibling after another.
You mind if we interview a few of the kids?
They're not conscious.
None of them?
No.
Can we talk to the parents?
If you think it'll help.
Yeah, yeah.
Who was your most recent admission?
I should get back to my girls.
We understand that,
And we really appreciate you talking to us.
Now, you say mary's the oldest?
13.
Okay, and she came down with it first, right?
And then...
Bethany the next night.
Within 24 hours?
I guess.
Look, i already went through all this with the doctor.
Right.
Just a few more questions, if you don't mind.
How do you think they caught pneumonia?
Were they out in the cold, anything like that?
No, we think it was an open window.
Both times?
The first time, i don't really remember,
But the second time for sure,
And i know i closed it before i put bethany to bed.
So you think she opened it?
It's a second-Story window, no ledge.
No one else could have.
You know this might not be anything supernatural.
It might just be pneumonia.
Maybe.
Or maybe something opened that window.
I don't know, man.
Look, dad sent us down here for a reason.
I think we might be barking up the right tree.
I'll tell you one thing.
What?
That guy we just talked to -
I'm betting it'll be a while before he goes home.
You got anything over there?
No, nothing.
Yeah, me neither.
Hey, dean.
Dean: yeah?
You were right.
It's not pneumonia.
It's rotted.
What the hell leaves a handprint like that?
Man: cheetara.
Woman: i am sorry to wake you,
But jaga bids me to bring you to him.
John: all right.
You know the drill, dean.
If anyone calls, you don't pick up.
If it's me, i'll ring once and then call back.
You got that?
Mm-Hmm.
Don't answer the phone unless it rings once first.
Come on, dude.
Look alive.
This stuff's important.
I know, it's just,
We've done it like a million times,
And you know i'm not stupid.
I know you're not, but it only takes one mistake.
You got that?
It's important that he join jaga on the flight deck.
All right, if i'm not back sunday night...
Call pastor jim.
Lock the doors and windows, close the shades,
And most important -
Watch out for sammy.
Responsible for lion-O's welfare, snarf is.
I know.
All right, if something tries to bust in...
Shoot first, ask questions later.
That's my man.
What's up, jaga?
Come closer.
What's happening to her?
What was that?
Dean: i know why dad sent us here.
He's faced this thing before.
He wants us to finish the job.
So what the hell is a shtriga?
It's kind of like a witch, i think.
I don't know much about them.
Well, i've never heard of it,
And it's not in dad's journal.
Dad hunted one in fort douglas, wisconsin,
About 16, 17 years ago.
You were there.
You don't remember?
No.
I guess he caught wind that the thing's in fitchburg now
And kicked us the coordinates.
So wait, this... shtriga.
Right, you think it's the same one dad hunted before?
Yeah, maybe.
If dad went after it, why is it still breathing air?
Because it got away.
Got away?
Yeah, sammy, it happens.
Not very often.
I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe dad didn't have his wheaties that morning.
What else do you remember?
Nothing.
I was a kid, all right?
King or two queens?
Two queens.
Yeah, i bet.
What'd you say?
Nice car.
Hi.
Checking in?
Yeah.
Uh, do me a favor.
Go get your brother some dinner.
I'm helping a guest.
Two queens.
Funny kid.
Oh, yeah, he thinks so.
Will that be cash or credit?
Do you take mastercard?
Mm-Hmm.
Perfect.
There you go.
Thank you.
When's dad gonna get back?
Tomorrow.
When?
I don't know.
He usually comes in late, though.
Now, eat your dinner.
I'm sick of "scabetti-Os."
Well, you're the one who wanted them.
I want lucky charms.
There's no more lucky charms.
I saw the box.
Okay, maybe there is,
But there's only enough left for one bowl,
And i haven't had any yet.
Do you want the prize?
Sir?
Thanks.
Well, you were right.
It wasn't very easy to find, but you were right.
A shtriga is a kind of witch.
They're albanian,
But legends about them date back to ancient rome.
They feed off of spiritus vitae.
Spirit what?
Vitae.
It's latin.
It translates to "breath of life,"
Kind of like your life force or essence.
Didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies were wearing out?
It's a thought.
You know, she takes your vitality,
Maybe your immunity goes to hell, pneumonia takes hold.
Anyway, shtrigas can feed off anyone, but they prefer -
Children.
Yeah.
Probably because they have stronger life force.
And get this
- Shtrigas are invulnerable
To all weapons devised by god and man.
No, that's not right.
She's vulnerable when she feeds.
What?
If you catch her when she's eating,
You can blast her with consecrated wrought irons,
Buckshots or rounds i think.
How do you know that?
Dad told me.
I remember.
Oh.
So, uh, anything else dad might have mentioned?
No, that's it.
What?
Nothing.
Okay, so, assuming we can kill it when it eats,
We've still got to find the thing first,
Which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.
Shtrigas take on a human disguise when they're not hunting.
What kind of human disguise?
Historically, something innocuous.
It could be anything, but it's usually a feeble old woman,
Which may be how the witches-As- Old-Crones legend got started.
Hang on.
What?
Check this out.
I marked down all the addresses of the victims.
Now, these are the houses that have been hit so far,
And dead center -
The hospital.
When we were there, i saw a patient, an old woman.
An old person, huh?
Yeah.
In the hospital?
Whew!
Better call the coast guard.
Well, listen, smartass,
She had an inverted cross hanging on her wall.
Betty: good night, dr.
Hydaker.
See you tomorrow, betty.
Try to get some sleep, aaron.
Come on.
Who the hell are you?
Who's there?
You trying to steal my stuff?
They're always stealing around here.
No, ma'am, we're maintenance.
We're sorry.
We thought you were sleeping.
Ah, nonsense.
I was sleeping with my peepers open.
And fix that crucifix, would you?
I've asked four damn times already.
"I was sleeping with my peepers open."
I almost smoked that old gal, i swear.
It's not funny.
Oh, man, you should have seen your face, dean.
Oh, yeah, laugh it on, man.
We're back to square one.
Hang on.
Hey, what's wrong?
My brother's sick.
The little guy?
Pneumonia.
He's in the hospital.
It's my fault.
No, come on.
How?
I should have made sure the window was latched.
He wouldn't have gotten pneumonia
If the window was latched.
Listen to me.
I can promise you that this is not your fault, okay?
It's my job to look after him.
Michael.
Turn on the "no vacancy" sign while i'm gone.
I've got denise covering room service,
So don't bother with the rooms.
I'm going with you.
Not now, michael.
But i got to see asher.
Dean: hey, michael.
Hey.
I know how you feel.
I'm a big brother, too.
But you got to go easy on your mom right now, okay?
Aw, damn it.
I got it.
Thanks.
You're in no condition to drive.
Why don't you let me give you a lift to the hospital?
No, no, i couldn't possibly -
No, no trouble.
I insist.
Be good.
We're gonna kill this thing.
I want it dead.
You hear me?
Dean: hey.
Hey, how's the kid?
He's not good.
Where you at?
I'm at the library,
Trying to find out as much as i can about this shtriga.
Yeah, what do you got?
Well, bad news.
I started with fort douglas
Around the time you said dad was there.
And?
Same deal.
Before that, there was ogdenville.
Before that, north haverbrook and brockway.
Every 15 to 20 years, it hits a new town.
Dean, this thing is just getting started in fitchburg.
In all these other places, it goes on for months,
Dozens of kids, before the shtriga finally moves on.
Kids just languish in comas, and then they die.
How far back does this thing go?
I don't know.
The earliest mention i could find is this place
Called black river falls back in the 1890s.
Talk about a horror show.
Whoa.
Sam?
Hold on.
I'm looking at a photograph right now
Of a bunch of doctors standing around a kid's bed.
One of the doctors is hydaker.
And?
And this picture was taken in 1893.
You sure?
Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.
Don't worry.
Your son's in good hands.
I'm gonna take care of him.
So what's the cdc come up with so far?
We're still working on a few theories.
You'll know something as soon as we do.
Well, nothing's more important to me than these kids.
Hmm.
Just let me know if i can help.
I'll do that.
Sam: we should have thought of this before.
Doctor's a perfect disguise.
You're trusted.
You can control the whole thing.
Huh.
That son of a bitch.
I'm surprised you didn't draw on him right there.
Yeah, well...
First of all,
I'm not gonna open fire in a freakin' pediatrics ward.
Good call.
Second, it wouldn't have done any good
Because the bastard's bulletproof
Unless he's chowing down on something.
And third, i wasn't packing,
Which is probably a really good thing
'Cause i probably would have just burned a clip in him
Off of principle alone.
You're getting wise in your old age, dean.
You're damn right.
'Cause now i know how we're gonna get it.
What do you mean?
The shtriga
- It works through siblings, right?
Right.
Well, last night...
It went after asher.
Tonight it's probably gonna come after michael.
Then we got to get him out of here.
No.
No, that would blow the whole deal.
What?
Yeah.
Then you want to use the kid as bait?
Are you nuts?
No.
Forget it.
That's out of the question.
Sam, it's the only way
- If this thing disappears,
It could be years before we get another chance.
Michael's a kid, and i'm not gonna dangle him
In front of that thing like a worm on a hook.
Dad did not send me here to walk away.
Send you here?
He didn't send you here.
He sent us here.
This isn't about you, sam.
I'm the one that screwed up.
It's my fault.
There's no telling how many kids have gotten hurt
Because of me.
What are you saying, dean?
How is it your fault?
Dean.
You've been hiding something from the get-Go.
Since when does dad bail on a hunt?
Since when does he let something get away?
Now, talk to me, man.
Tell me what's going on.
Fort douglas, wisconsin.
It was the third night in this crap room,
And i was climbing the walls, man.
I needed to get some air.
...if ever i saw one.
Command performance.
Hey, kid.
We're closing up.
Get out of the way!
Sammy.
Sammy.
Sammy.
You okay?
Sam: dad, what's going on?
Are you all right?
What happened?
I
- I just went out.
What?
J
- Just for a second.
I'm sorry.
I told you not to leave this room.
I told you not to let him out of your sight.
Dad just grabbed us and booked,
Dropped us off at pastor jim's about three hours away.
By the time he got back to fort douglas,
The shtriga had disappeared.
It was just gone.
It never resurfaced until now.
Dad never spoke about it again.
I didn't ask.
But he, uh...
He looked at me different, you know, which was worse.
Not that i blame him.
He gave me an order, and i didn't listen,
And i almost got you killed.
You were just a kid.
Don't.
Dad knew this was unfinished business for me.
He sent me here to finish it.
But using michael
- I don't know, dean.
I mean, how about one of us hides under the cover?
You know, we'll be the bait.
No, that won't work.
It's got to get close enough to feed.
It'll see us.
Believe me, i don't like it, but it's got to be the kid.
Michael: you're crazy!
Just go away or i'm calling the cops.
Hang on a second.
Just listen to me.
You have to believe me, okay?
This thing came through the window
And attacked your brother.
I've seen it.
I know what it looks like
'Cause it attacked my brother once, too.
This thing -
Is it, like...
It has this long, black robe?
You saw it last night, didn't you?
I thought i was having a nightmare.
I'd give anything not to tell you this,
But sometimes nightmares are real.
So why are you telling me?
Because we need your help.
My help?
We can kill it, me and him.
It's what we do.
But we can't do it without you.
What?
No.
Michael, listen to me.
This thing hurt asher,
And it's gonna keep hurting kids unless we stop it.
Do you understand me?
Well, that went crappy.
Now what?
What did you expect?
You can't ask an adult to do something like that,
Much less a kid.
If you kill it, will asher get better?
Honestly, we don't know.
You said you're a big brother.
Yeah.
You'd take care of your little brother?
You'd do anything for him?
Yeah, i would.
Me too.
I'll help.
This camera has night vision on it,
So we'll be able to see you as clear as day.
Are we good?
Hair to the right.
There, there.
Michael: what do i do?
Just stay under the covers.
And if it shows up?
Well, we'll be right in the next room.
We're gonna come in with guns, so as soon as we do,
You roll off this bed and you crawl under it.
What if you shoot me?
We won't shoot you.
We're good shots.
We're not gonna fire until you're clear, okay?
Have you heard a gunshot before?
Like in the movies?
It's gonna be a lot louder than in the movies.
So i want you to stay under the bed, cover your ears,
And do not come out until we say so, you understand?
Michael, are you sure you want to do this?
You don't have to.
It's okay.
I won't be mad.
No, i'm okay.
Just don't shoot me.
We're not gonna let anything happen to you.
I promise.
What time is it?
3:00.
You sure these iron rounds are gonna work?
Consecrated iron rounds.
And yeah, it's what dad used last time.
Hey, dean, i'm sorry.
For what?
You know...
I've really given you a lot of crap
For always following dad's orders,
But i know why you do it.
Oh, god.
Kill me now.
Wait, look.
Now?
Not yet.
Michael, down!
Mike, you all right?
Yeah.
Just sit tight.
Dean!
Dean: hey!
You okay, little brother?
It's okay, michael.
You can come on out.
Hey, joanna, how's asher doing?
Have you seen michael?
Michael: mom!
Mom!
Hey!
How's ash?
I've got some good news.
Your brother's gonna be fine.
Really?
Yeah, really.
No one can explain it.
It's, uh, it's a miracle.
They're gonna keep him in overnight for observation,
But after that, he's coming home.
That's great.
How are all the other kids doing?
Good, real good.
A bunch of them should be checking out in a few days.
Dr. Travis says the ward's gonna be like a ghost town.
Dr. Travis?
What about dr.
Hydaker?
Oh, he wasn't in today.
He must have been sick or something.
Yeah, yeah, must have.
So did anything happen while i was gone?
No, same old stuff.
Okay.
You can go see ash.
Now?
Only if you want to.
I better get going
Before he hot-Wires the car and drives himself.
It's too bad.
No, they'll be fine.
That's not what i meant.
I meant michael.
He'll always know there are things out there in the dark.
He'll never be the same, you know?
Sometimes i wish that...
What?
I wish i could have that kind of innocence.
If it means anything, sometimes i wish you could, too.
Previously on Supernatural:
Sammy.
Take your brother outside as fast as you can.
Go.
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.
This is Dad's book.
I think he wants us to pick up where he left off.
You know, saving people, hunting things.
The family business.
I gotta find Dad.
It's the only thing I can think about.
Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
Thy angels watch me through the night.
And keep me safe till morning light.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Good night, monkey-puss.
Daddy is Mommy coming home?
No, honey.
She's spending the night at the hospital with your sister.
Hey.
You sleep tight, now.
Yeah.
You probably missed something, that's what.
Dude, I ran LexisNexis, local police records, newspapers.
I couldn't find a single red flag.
Are you sure you got the coordinates right?
Yeah. I double-checked.
It's Fitchburg, Wisconsin.
Dad wouldn't have sent coordinates if it wasn't important.
I'm telling you, I looked.
All I found was a big, steamy pile of nothing.
If Dad's sending us hunting for something, I don't know what.
- Maybe he'll meet us there.
- Yeah.
Because he's been so easy to find up to this point.
You're a real smart-ass, you know that?
I'm sure there's something in Fitchburg worth killing.
Yeah?
What makes you so sure?
Well, because I'm the oldest, which means I'm always right.
- No, it doesn't.
- lt totally does.
Well the waitress thinks that the local Freemasons are up to something sneaky but other than that, nobody's heard about anything weird going on.
Dean, you got the time?
Ten after 4.
Why?
What's wrong with this picture?
School's out, isn't it?
Yeah.
So where is everybody?
This place should be crawling with kids right now.
Sure is quiet out here.
Yeah. lt's a shame.

Just five or six, but serious.
Hospital serious.
A lot of parents are getting pretty anxious.
They think it's catching.
Hm.
Dude.
Dude, I am not using this id.
- Why not?
- Because it says "bikini inspector" on it.
She won't look that close.
Hell, she won't even ask to see it.
It's all about confidence, Sammy.
Hi. I'm Doctor Jerry Kaplan, Center for Disease Control.
Can I see some lD?
Yeah, of course.
Now, could you direct me to the pediatrics ward, please?
Well, just go down the hall.
Turn left.
Up the stairs.
See?
Told you it'd work.
Follow me.
It's upstairs.
Dean.
Thanks for seeing us, Dr. Heidecker.
Well, I'm glad you guys are here.
I was just about to call CDC myself.
How'd you find out, anyway?
Oh, some G.P. I forget his name.
He called Atlanta and must've beat you to the punch.
So you say you've got six cases so far?
Yeah, yeah.
Five weeks.
At first, we thought it was garden variety bacterial pneumonia.
Not newsworthy.
But now...
Now what?
The kids aren't responding to antibiotics.
Their white cell counts keep going down.
Their immune systems just aren't doing their job.
It's like their bodies are wearing out.
Excuse me, Dr. Heidecker?

I should get back to my girls.
We understand that, and we really appreciate you talking to us.
Now, you say Mary's the oldest?
- Thirteen.
- Okay.
She came down with it first, right?
- And then-
- Bethany, the next night.
Within 24 hours?
I guess.
Look, I already went through all this with the doctor.
Right.
Now, just a few more questions, if you don't mind.
How do you think they caught pneumonia?
Were they out in the cold?
Anything like that?
- No, we think it was an open window.
- Both times?
The first time, I don't- I don't really remember.
But the second time for sure.
- l closed it before I put Bethany to bed.
- So you think she opened it?
It's a second-story window, no ledge.
No one else could have.
You know, this might not be anything supernatural.
- Might just be pneumonia.
- Maybe.
Or maybe something opened that window.

All right.
You know the drill, Dean.
Anybody calls, you don't pick up.
If it's me, I'll ring once and then call back.
You got that?
Don't answer the phone unless it rings once first.
Come on, dude.
Look alive.
This stuff's important.
I know.
It's just we've gone over it, like, a million times, and you know I'm not stupid.
I know you're not, but it only takes one mistake.
You got that?
- All right, if I'm not back Sunday night-
- Call Pastor Jim.
Lock the doors, the windows.
Close the shades.
- And most important-
- Watch out for Sammy.
- l know.
- All right.
- Something tries to bust in?
- Shoot first, ask questions later.
That's my man.
- What's up, Jaga?
- Come closer, Lion-O.
I know why Dad sent us here.
He's faced this thing before.
He wants us to finish the job.
So, what the hell is a Shtriga?
It's kind of like a witch, I think.
They don't know that much about them.
I've never heard of it, and it's not in Dad's journal.
Dad hunted one in Fort Douglas, Wisconsin about 16, 17 years ago.
- You were there.
You don't remember?
- No.
Guess he caught wind it's in Fitchburg, and kicked us the coordinates.
- So wait, this...
- Shtriga.
Right.
You think it's the same one Dad hunted before?
Yeah, maybe.
If Dad went after it, why is it still breathing air?
- Because it got away.
- Got away?
- Yeah, Sammy. lt happens.
- Not very often.
I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe Dad didn't have his Wheaties that morning.
- What else do you remember?
- Nothing. I was a kid, all right?
King or two queens?
Two queens.
- Yeah, I bet.
- What'd you say?
Nice car.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Checking in?
- Yeah.
Do me a favor, go get your brother some dinner.
I'm helping a guest.
Two queens.
- Funny kid.
Oh, yeah.
He thinks so.
- Will that be cash or credit?
- You take MasterCard?
- Mm-hm.
- Perfect.
Here you go.
When's Dad gonna get back?
Tomorrow.
- When?
- l don't know.
He usually comes in late, though.
Now, eat your dinner.
I'm sick of "scabetti-ohs."
Well, you're the one who wanted them.
I want Lucky Charms.
- There's no more Lucky Charms.
- l saw the box.
Okay, maybe there is.
But there's only enough left for one bowl, and I haven't had any yet.
Do you want the prize?
Sir?
Thanks.
Well, you were right.
It wasn't very easy to find, but you were right.
A Shtriga is a kind of witch.
They're Albanian, but legends about them date back to ancient Rome.
They need off of spiritus vitae.
- Spirit what?
- Vitae.
It's Latin.
Translates to "breath of life."
Kind of like your life force or essence.
Didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies were wearing out?
It's a thought.
She takes your vitality, maybe your immunity goes to hell.
Pneumonia takes hold.
Anyway, Shtrigas can feed off anyone.
- But they prefer-
- Children.
Yeah.
Probably because they have stronger life force.
And get this:
"Shtrigas are invulnerable to all weapons devised by God and man."
No.
That's not right.
She's vulnerable when she feeds.
What?
If you catch her while eating, you can blast her with consecrated wrought iron.
Buckshots or rounds, I think.
- How do you know that?
- Dad told me.
I remember.
Oh.
So anything else Dad might've mentioned?
No, that's it.
What?
Nothing.
Okay.
So assuming we can kill it when it eats, we still gotta find the thing first which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.
Shtrigas take a human disguise when they're not hunting.
- What kind of human disguise?
- Historically, something innocuous.
Anything, but it's usually a feeble old woman which may be how the whole witches-as-old-crones legend got started.
- Hang on.
- What?
Check this out.
I marked down all the addresses of the victims.
These are the houses that have been hit so far.
- And dead center...
- The hospital.
The hospital.
When we were there, I saw a patient, an old woman.
- An old person, huh?
- Yeah.
In the hospital?
Whoo.
Better call the coast guard.
Listen, smart-ass.
She had an inverted cross hanging on her wall.
Good night, Doctor.
HElDECKER:
See you, Betty.
Try to get some sleep.
Who the hell are you?
Who's there?
You're trying to steal my stuff?
They're always stealing around here.
No, ma'am, we're maintenance.
We're sorry.
We thought you were sleeping.
Nonsense. I was sleeping with my peepers open.
And fix that crucifix, would you?
I've asked four damn times already.
"I was sleeping with my peepers open"?
I almost smoked that old gal, I swear.
It's not funny.
Oh, man.
You should've seen your face, Dean.
Oh, yeah.
Laugh it up.
We're back to square one.
Hang on.
Hey.
What's wrong?
My brother's sick.
The little guy?
Pneumonia.
He's in the hospital.
It's my fault.
Oh, come on.
How?
I should have made sure the window was latched.
He wouldn't have got pneumonia if the window was latched.
Listen to me.
I can promise you that this is not your fault.
Okay?
It's my job to look after him.
Michael.
Turn on the "no vacancy" sign while I'm gone.
- l've got Denise covering room service.
- l'm going with you.
- Not now, Michael.
- But I gotta see Asher.
Hey, Michael.
Hey.
I know how you feel, okay?
I'm a big brother too but you gotta go easy on your mom right now, okay?
Damn it.
- l got it.
- Here.
- Thanks.
You're in no condition to drive.
Let me give you a lift.
- No, I couldn't possibly-
- No, it's no trouble. I insist.
Thanks.
Be good.
We're gonna kill this thing.
I want it dead, you hear me?
Hey.
- Hey.
How's the kid?
- He's not good.
Where you at?
- I'm at the library.
Trying to find out as much as I can about this Shtriga.
- Yeah, what do you got?
- Well, bad news.
I started with
- With Fort Douglas, around the time you said Dad was there.
- And?
- Same deal.
Before that, there was- There was Ogdenville.
before that, North Haverbrook and Brockway.
Every 15 to 20 years it hits a new town.
Dean, this thing is just getting started in Fitchburg.
In all these other places, it goes on for months dozens of kids before the Shtriga finally moves on.
Kids just languish in comas and then they die.
- How far back does this thing go?
- I don't know.
Earliest mention I could find was this place called Black River Falls back in the 1890s.
Talk about a horror show.
Whoa.
Sam?
Hold on.
I'm looking at a photograph right now of a bunch of doctors standing around a kid's bed.
One of the doctors is Heidecker.
- And?
- And this picture was taken in 1893.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.
Don't worry.
Your son's in good hands.
I'm gonna take care of him.
So, what's the CDC come up with so far?
We're still working on a few theories.
You'll know something as soon as we do.
Well, nothing's more important to me than these kids.
Just let me know if I can help.
I'll do that.
We should have thought of this before.
A doctor's a perfect disguise.
You're trusted.
You can control the whole thing.
That son of a bitch.
I'm surprised you didn't draw on him right there.
Yeah, well first of all, I'm not gonna open fire in a frigging pediatrics ward.
- Good call.
- Second, it wouldn't have done any good.
The bastard's bulletproof unless he's chowing down on something.
And third, I wasn't packing, which is probably a really good thing because I probably would've just burned a clip in him off the principle alone.
- You're getting wise in your old age.
- You're damn right.
Because now I know how we're gonna get it.
What do you mean?
- The Shtriga works through siblings?
- Right.
- Well, last night- - lt went after Asher.
- Tonight it's gonna come after Michael.
- Then we gotta get him out of here.
- No, that would blow the whole deal.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Then you wanna use the kid as bait?
Are you nuts?
No.
Forget it.
That's out of the question.
It's the only way.
If this thing disappears, it could be years before we get a chance.
I'm not gonna dangle him in front of that thing like a worm on a hook.
Dad did not send me here to walk away.
Send you here?
He didn't send you here, he sent us here.
This isn't about you, Sam.
I'm the one that screwed up.
It's my fault.
There's no telling how many kids have gotten hurt because of me.
What are you saying, Dean?
How is it your fault?
Dean you've been hiding something from the get-go.
Since when does Dad bail on a hunt?
Since when does he let something get away?
Now, talk to me, man.
Tell me what's going on.
Fort Douglas, Wisconsin.
It was the third night in this crap room and I was climbing the walls, man.
I needed to get some air.
Kid.
We're closing up.
Get out of the way!
Sammy.
Sammy.
Sammy.
- You okay?
Dad, what's going on?
You all right?
- What happened?
- l just went out.
- What?
- Just for a second. I'm sorry.
I told you not to leave this room.
I told you not to let him out of your sight.
Dad just grabbed us and booked.
Dropped us off at Pastor Jim's about three hours away.
By the time he got back to Fort Douglas, the Shtriga disappeared.
It was- lt was just gone.
It never resurfaced until now.
You know, Dad never spoke about it again.
I didn't ask.
But he...
He looked at me different, you know?
Which was worse.
Not that I blamed him.
He gave me an order, and I didn't listen.
I almost got you killed.
- You were just a kid.
- Don't.
Don't.
Dad knew this was unfinished business for me.
He sent me here to finish it.
But using Michael...
I don't know, Dean.
I mean, how about one of us hides under the cover, you know?
We'll be the bait.
No, it won't work.
It's gotta get close enough to feed.
It'll see us.
Believe me, I don't like it, but it's gotta be the kid.
You're crazy.
Just go away, or I'm calling the cops.
Hang on a second.
Just listen to me.
You have to believe me, okay?
This thing came through the window, and it attacked your brother.
I've seen it.
I know what it looks like because it attacked my brother once too.
This thing, is it, like...?
It has this long, black robe?
You saw it last night, didn't you?
I thought I was having a nightmare.
I'd give anything not to tell you this but sometimes nightmares are real.
- So why are you telling me?
- Because we need your help.
My help?
We can kill it, me and him, it's what we do.
But we can't do it without you.
What?
No.
Michael, listen to me.
This thing hurt Asher and it's gonna keep hurting kids unless we stop it.
Do you understand me?
Well, that went crappy.
- Now what?
- What did you expect?
You can't ask an adult to do something like that, much less a kid.
If you kill it, will Asher get better?
Honestly, we don't know.
You said you're a big brother.
Yeah.
You'd take care of your little brother?
You'd do anything for him?
Yeah, I would.
Me too.
I'll help.
This camera has night vision on it, so we'll be able to see as clear as day.
- Are we good?
- Hair to the right.
There, there.
michael:
What do I do?
Just stay under the covers.
michael:
And if it shows up?
Well, we'll be right in the next room.
We're gonna come in with guns.
So, soon as we do, you roll off this bed and you crawl under it.
- What if you shoot me?
- We won't shoot you.
We're good shots.
We're not gonna fire until you're clear, okay?
- Have you heard a gunshot before?
- Like in the movies?
It's gonna be a lot louder than in the movies.
So I want you to stay under the bed cover your ears, and do not come out until we say so, you understand?
Michael, you sure you wanna do this?
You don't have to, it's okay.
I won't be mad.
No, I'm okay.
Just don't shoot me.
We're not gonna let anything happen to you.
Promise.
What time is it?
It's 3.
You sure these iron rounds are gonna work?
Consecrated iron rounds.
And, yeah, it's what Dad used last time.
Hey, Dean, I'm sorry.
For what?
You know I've really given you a lot of crap for always following Dad's orders.
- But I know why you do it.
- Oh, God.
Kill me now.
Wait, look.
- Now?
- Not yet.
Hey!
Michael, down!
- Mike, you all right?
- Yeah.
Just sit tight.
Dean!
Hey!
You okay, little brother?
It's okay, Michael.
You can come on out.
- Hey, Joanna.
How's Asher doing?
- Have you seen Michael?
michael:
Mom!
Mom!
- Hey.
- How's Ash?
Got some good news.
- Your brother's gonna be fine.
- Really?
Yeah, really.
No one can explain it.
It's
- It's a miracle.
They're gonna keep him overnight, but after that, he's coming home.
- That's great.
- How are all the other kids doing?
Good.
Real good.
A bunch of them should be checking out in a few days.
Dr. Travis says the ward's gonna be like a ghost town.
Dr. Travis?
What about Dr. Heidecker?
Oh, he wasn't in today.
Must have been sick or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, must have.
So did anything happen while I was gone?
No, same old stuff.
- Okay.
You can go see Ash.
- Now?
Only if you want to.
I better get going before he hot-wires the car and drives himself.
It's too bad.
Oh, they'll be fine.
That's not what I meant.
I meant Michael.
He'll always know there are things out there in the dark.
Never be the same, you know?
Sometimes I wish that...
What?
I wish I could have that kind of innocence.
If it means anything, sometimes I wish you could too.
Now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the lord my soul to keep.
Thy angels watch me through the night and keep me safe till morning light.
Amen.
Amen.
Night, monkeypuss.
Daddy?
Is mommy coming home?
No, honey.
She's spending the night at the hospital with your sister.
Hey.
You sleep tight now.
Yeah, you probably missed something.
That's why.
Dude, I ran lexisnexis, local police reports, newspapers.
I couldn't find a single red flag.
Are you sure you got the coordinates right?
Yeah, I double-checked.
It's Fitchburg, Wisconsin.
Dad wouldn't have sent us coordinates if it wasn't important, Sammy.
Well, I'm telling you, I looked, and all I could find was a big, steamy pile of nothing.
If dad's sending us hunting for something, I don't know what.
Well, maybe he's gonna meet us there.
Yeah, 'cause he's been so easy to find up to this point.
You're a real smartass, you know that?
Don't worry.
I'm sure there's something in Fitchburg worth killing.
Yeah?
What makes you so sure?
Because I'm the oldest, which means I'm always right.
No, it doesn't.
It totally does.
Well, that the local freemasons are up to something sneaky, but... other than that, nobody's heard about anything weird going on.
Dean, you got the time?
10 after 4:00.
Why?
What's wrong with this picture?
School's out, isn't it?
Yeah.
So where is everybody?
This place should be crawling with kids right now.
It sure is quiet out here.
Yeah, it's a shame.
Why is that?
You know, kids getting sick.
It's a terrible thing.
How many?
Just five or six, but serious, hospital serious.
A lot of parents are getting pretty anxious.
They think it's catching.
Dude, dude, I am not using this I.D.
Why not?
Because it says "bikini inspector" on it.
Don't worry.
She won't look that close.
Hell, she won't even ask to see it.
It's all about confidence, Sammy.
Hi.
I'm Dr. Jerry Kaplan, in the center for disease control.
Can I see some I.D.?
Yeah, of course.
Now, could you direct me to the pediatrics ward, please?
Okay, just go down that hall, turn left, up the stairs.
See?
Told you it would work.
Follow me.
It's upstairs.
Dean.
Thanks for seeing us, Dr. Hydaker.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are here.
I was just about to call the CDC myself.
How did you find out anyway?
Oh, some G.P...
I forget his name...
He called Atlanta and... must have beat you to the punch.
So you say you got six cases so far?
Yeah, in five weeks.
At first I thought it was bacterial pneumonia, not that newsworthy.
But now...
Now, what?
The kids aren't responding to antibiotics.
Their white-cell counts keep going down.
Their immune systems just aren't doing their job.
It's like their bodies are...
- wearing out.
- Excuse me, Dr. Hydaker.
You ever see anything like this before?
Never this severe.
The way it spreads...
That's a new one for me.
What do you mean?
It works its way through families, but only the children, one sibling after another.
You mind if we interview a few of the kids?
They're not conscious.
None of them?
No.
Can we talk to the parents?
If you think it'll help.
Yeah, yeah.
Who was your most recent admission?
I should get back to my girls.
We understand that, and we really appreciate you talking to us.
Now, you say Mary's the oldest?
13.
Okay, and she came down with it first, right?
And then...
Bethany, the next night.
Within 24 hours?
I guess.
Look, I already went through all this with the doctor.
Right.
Just a few more questions, if you don't mind.
How do you think they caught pneumonia?
Were they out in the cold, anything like that?
- No, we think it was an open window.
- Both times?
The first time, I don't...
I don't really remember, but the second time for sure, and...
- I know I closed it before I put Bethany to bed.
- So you think she opened it?
It's a second-story window, no ledge.
No one else could have.
You know this might not be anything supernatural.
- It might just be pneumonia.
- Maybe.
Or maybe something opened that window.
I don't know, man.
Look, dad sent us down here for a reason.
- I think we might be barking up the right tree.
- I'll tell you one thing.
What?
That guy we just talked to...
I'm betting it'll be a while before he goes home.
You got anything over there?
No, nothing.
Yeah, me neither.
Hey, Dean.
Yeah?
You were right.
It's not pneumonia.
It's rotted.
What the hell leaves a handprint like that?
All right.
You know the drill, Dean.
If anyone calls, you don't pick up.
If it's me,
I'll ring once and then call back.
You got that?
Don't answer the phone unless it rings once first.
Come on, dude.
Look alive.
This stuff's important.
I know, it's just, we've done it like a million times, and you know I'm not stupid.
I know you're not, but it only takes one mistake.
You got that?
All right, if I'm not back sunday night...
Call pastor Jim.
Lock the doors and windows, close the shades,
- and most important...
- Watch out for Sammy.
I know.
All right, if something tries to bust in...
Shoot first, ask questions later.
That's my man.
I know why dad sent us here.
He's faced this thing before.
He wants us to finish the job.
So what the hell is a shtriga?
It's kind of like a witch, I think.
I don't know much about them.
Well, I've never heard of it, and it's not in dad's journal.
Dad hunted one in Fort Douglas, Wisconsin, about 16, 17 years ago.
- You were there.
You don't remember?
- No.
I guess he caught wind that the thing's in Fitchburg now and kicked us the coordinates.
So wait, this...
Shtriga.
Right, you think it's the same one dad hunted before?
Yeah, maybe.
If dad went after it, why is it still breathing air?
Because it got away.
Got away?
- Yeah, Sammy, it happens.
- Not very often.
I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe dad didn't have his wheaties that morning.
- What else do you remember?
- Nothing.
I was a kid, all right?
King or two queens?
Two queens.
Yeah, I bet.
- What'd you say?
- Nice car.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Checking in?
- Yeah.
Uh, do me a favor.
Go get your brother some dinner.
I'm helping a guest.
Two queens.
Funny kid.
Oh, yeah, he thinks so.
Will that be cash or credit?
Do you take mastercard?
Perfect.
There you go.
When's dad gonna get back?
Tomorrow.
When?
I don't know.
He usually comes in late, though.
Now, eat your dinner.
I'm sick of "scabetti-os. "
You're the one who wanted them.
I want lucky charms.
- There's no more lucky charms.
- I saw the box.
Okay, maybe there is, but there's only enough left for one bowl and I haven't had any yet.
Do you want the prize?
Sir?
Thanks.
Well, you were right.
It wasn't very easy to find, but you were right.
A shtriga is a kind of witch.
They're albanian, but legends about them date back to ancient Rome.
They feed off of "spiritus vitae".
- Spirit what?
- Vitae.

It translates to "breath of life", kind of like your life force or essence.
Didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies were wearing out?
It's a thought.
You know, she takes your vitality, maybe your immunity goes to hell, pneumonia takes hold.
Anyway, shtrigas can feed off anyone, but they prefer... children.
Yeah.
Probably because they have stronger life force.
And get this...
Shtrigas are invulnerable to all weapons devised by god and man.
No, that's not right.
She's vulnerable when she feeds.
What?
If you catch her when she's eating, you can blast her with consecrated wrought irons, buckshots or rounds I think.
How do you know that?
Dad told me.
I remember.
Oh.
So, uh, anything else dad might have mentioned?
No, that's it.
What?
Nothing.
Okay, so, assuming we can kill it when it eats, we've still got to find the thing first, which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.
Shtrigas take on a human disguise when they're not hunting.
What kind of human disguise?
Historically, something innocuous.
It could be anything, but it's usually a feeble old woman, which may be how
- the witches-as-old-crones legend got started.
- Hang on.
What?
Check this out.
I marked down all the addresses of the victims.
Now, these are the houses that have been hit so far, and dead center...
- the hospital.

- See you tomorrow, Betty.
Try to get some sleep.
Who the hell are you?
Who's there?
You trying to steal my stuff?
They're always stealing around here.
No, ma'am, we're maintenance.
We're sorry.
We thought you were sleeping.
Ah, nonsense.
I was sleeping with my peepers open.
And fix that crucifix, would you?
I've asked four damn times already.
"I was sleeping with my peepers open".
I almost smoked that old gal, I swear.
It's not funny.
Oh, man, you should have seen your face, Dean.
Oh, yeah, laugh it on, man.
We're back to square one.
Hang on.
Hey, what's wrong?
My brother's sick.
The little guy?
Pneumonia.
He's in the hospital.
It's my fault.
No, come on.
How?
I should have made sure the window was latched.
He wouldn't have gotten pneumonia if the window was latched.
Listen to me.
I can promise you that this is not your fault, okay?
It's my job to look after him.
Michael.
Well, turn on the "no vacancy" sign while I'm gone.
I've got Denise covering room service, so don't bother with the rooms.
- I'm going with you.
- Not now, Michael.
- But I got to see Asher.
- Hey, Michael.
Hey.
I know how you feel.
I'm a big brother, too.
But you got to go easy on your mom right now, okay?
- Damn it.
- I got it.
Thanks.
You're in no condition to drive.
Why don't you let me give you a lift to the hospital?
- No, no, I couldn't possibly...
- No, it's no trouble.
I insist.
Thanks.
Be good.
We're gonna kill this thing.
I want it dead.
You hear me?
- Hey.
- Hey, how's the kid?
He's not good.
Where you at?
I'm at the library, trying to find out as much as I can about this shtriga.

You're getting wise in your old age, Dean.
You're damn right.
'Cause now I know how we're gonna get it.
What do you mean?
The shtriga...
it works through siblings, right?
Right.
Well, last night... it went after Asher.
So tonight, it's probably gonna come after Michael.
Then we got to get him out of here.
No.
No, that would blow the whole deal.
- What?
- Yeah.
Then you want to use the kid as bait?
Are you nuts?
No.
- No. forget it.
That's out of the question.
- That's not out of the question, Sam.
It's the only way...
If this thing disappears, it could be years before we get another chance.
Michael's a kid, and I'm not gonna dangle him in front of that thing like a worm on a hook.
Dad did not send me here to walk away.
Send you here?
He didn't send you here.
He sent us here.
This isn't about you, Sam.
I'm the one that screwed up.
It's my fault.
There's no telling how many kids have gotten hurt because of me.
What are you saying, Dean?
How is it your fault?
Dean.
You've been hiding something from the get-go.
Since when does dad bail on a hunt?
Since when does he let something get away?
Now, talk to me, man.
Tell me what's going on.
Fort Douglas, Wisconsin.
It was... the third night in this... crap room, and I was climbing the walls, man.
I needed to get some air.
Hey, kid.
We're closing up.
Get out of the way!
Sammy.
Sammy.
You okay?
Dad, what's going on?
Are you all right?
What happened?
I...
I just went out.
What?
Just for a second.
I'm sorry.
I told you not to leave this room.
I told you not to let him out of your sight.
Dad just... grabbed us and booked,
dropped us off at pastor Jim's about three hours away.
By the time he got back to...
Fort Douglas, the shtriga had disappeared.
It was... just gone.
It never resurfaced until now.
Dad never spoke about it again.
I didn't ask.
But he, uh...
He looked at me different, you know, which was worse.
Not that I blame him.
He gave me an order, and I didn't listen, and I almost got you killed.
- You were just a kid.
- Don't.
Don't.
Dad knew this was unfinished business for me.
He sent me here to finish it.
But using Michael...
I don't know, Dean.
I mean, how about one of us hides under the cover?
You know, we'll be the bait.
No, that won't work.
It's got to get close enough to feed.
It'll see us.
Believe me, I don't like it, but it's got to be the kid.
You're crazy!
Just...
- go away or I'm calling the cops.
- Hang on a second.
Just listen to me.
You have to believe me, okay?
This thing came through the window and then attacked your brother.
I've seen it.
I know what it looks like 'cause it attacked my brother once, too.
This thing... is it, like... it has this long, black robe?
You saw it last night, didn't you?
I thought I was having a nightmare.
I'd give anything not to tell you this, but sometimes nightmares are real.
So... why are you telling me?
Because we need your help.
My help?
We can kill it, me and him.
It's what we do.
But we can't do it without you.
What?
- No.
- Michael, listen to me.
This thing hurt Asher, and it's gonna keep hurting kids unless we stop it.
Do you understand me?
Well, that went crappy.
Now what?
What did you expect?
You can't ask an adult to do something like that, much less a kid.
If you kill it, will Asher get better?
Honestly?
We don't know.
You said you're a big brother.
Yeah.
You'd take care of your little brother?
You'd do anything for him?
Yeah, I would.
Me too.
I'll help.
This camera has night vision on it, so we'll be able to see you as clear as day.
Are we good?
Hair to the right.
There, there.
What do I do?
Just stay under the covers.
And if it shows up?
Well, we'll be right in the next room.
We're gonna come in with guns, so as soon as we do, you roll off this bed and you crawl under it.
What if you shoot me?
We won't shoot you.
We're good shots.
We're not gonna fire until you're clear, okay?
Have you heard a gunshot before?
Like in the movies?
It's gonna be a lot louder than in the movies.
So I want you to stay under the bed, cover your ears, and do not come out until we say so, you understand?
Michael, are you sure you want to do this?
You don't have to.
It's okay.
I won't be mad.
No, I'm okay.
Just don't shoot me.
We're not gonna let anything happen to you.
I promise.
What time is it?
3:00.
You sure these iron rounds are gonna work?
Consecrated iron rounds.
And yeah, it's what dad used last time.
Hey, Dean, I'm sorry.
For what?
You know...
I've really given you a lot of crap for always following dad's orders.
But I know why you do it.
Oh, god.
Kill me now.
Wait, look.
- Now?
- Not yet.
Michael, down!
- Mike, you all right?
- Yeah.
Just sit tight.
Dean!
You okay, little brother?
It's okay, Michael.
You can come on out.
Hey, Joanna, how's Asher doing?
- Have you seen Michael?
- Mom!
Mom!
- How's Ash?
- I've got some good news.
Your brother's gonna be fine.
- Really?
- Yeah, really.
No one can explain it.
It's, uh, it's a miracle.
They're gonna keep him in overnight for observation, but after that, he's coming home.
That's great.
- How are all the other kids doing?
- Good, real good.
A bunch of them should be checking out in a few days.
Dr. Travis says the ward's gonna be like a ghost town.
Dr. Travis?
What about Dr. Hydaker?
Oh, he wasn't in today.
He must have been sick or something.
Yeah, he must have.
So did anything happen while I was gone?
No, same old stuff.
You can go see Ash.
- Now?
- Only if you want to.
I better get going before he hot-wires the car and drives himself.
It's too bad.
No, they'll be fine.
That's not what I meant.
I meant Michael.
He'll always know there are things out there in the dark.
He'll never be the same, you know?
Sometimes I just wish that...
What?
I wish I could have that kind of innocence.
If it means anything, sometimes I wish you could, too.
sammy!
take your brother outside as fast as you can!
go!
dad's on a hunting trip.
and he hasn't been home in a few days.
this is dad's book.
i think he wants us to pick up where he left off - saving people, hunting things, the family business.
i got to find dad. it's the only think i can think about.
bethany:
now i lay me down to sleep.
i pray the lord my soul to keep.
thy angels watch me through the night and keep me safe till morning light.
amen.
night, monkeypuss.
daddy?
is mommy coming home?
no, honey.
she's spending the night at the hospital with your sister.
hey.
you sleep tight now.
dean: yeah, you probably missed something.
dude, i ran lexisnexis, local police reports, newspapers - i couldn't find a single red flag.
are you sure you got the coordinates right?
yeah, i double-checked.
it's fitchburg, wisconsin.
dad wouldn't have sent us coordinates if it wasn't important, sammy.
well, i'm telling you, i looked, and all i could find was a big, steamy pile of nothing.
if dad's sending us hunting for something, i don't know what.
well, maybe he's gonna meet us there.
yeah, 'cause he's been so easy to find up to this point.
you're a real smartass, you know that?
don't worry.
i'm sure there's something in fitchburg worth killing.
yeah?
what makes you so sure?
because i'm the oldest, which means i'm always right.
no, it doesn't.
it totally does.
well, the waitress thinks that the local freemasons are up to something sneaky, but other than that, nobody's heard about anything weird going on.
dean, you got the time?
10 after 4:00.
why?
what's wrong with this picture?
school's out, isn't it?
yeah.
so where is everybody?
this place should be crawling with kids right now.
it sure is quiet out here.
yeah, it's a shame.
why is that?
you know, kids getting sick.
it's a terrible thing.
how many?
just five or six, but serious, hospital serious.
a lot of parents are getting pretty anxious.
they think it's catching.
dude, dude, i am not using this i.d.
why not?
because it says "bikini inspector" on it.
don't worry.
she won't look that close.
hell, she won't even ask to see it.
it's all about confidence, sammy.
hi.
i'm dr. jerry kaplan, center for disease control.
can i see some i.d.?
yeah, of course.
now, could you direct me to the pediatrics ward?
okay, just go down that hall, turn left, up the stairs.
you'll see them.
right.
thank you.
see?
told you it would work.
follow me.
it's upstairs.
sam: dean.
thanks for seeing us, dr. hydaker.
oh, i'm glad you guys are here.
i was just about to call the cdc myself.
how did you find out anyway?
oh, some g.p. - i forget his name - he called atlanta and must have beat you to the punch.
so you say you got six cases so far?
yeah, in five weeks.
at first i thought it was bacterial pneumonia, not that newsworthy.
but now... now, what?
the kids aren't responding to antibiotics.
their white-cell counts keep going down.
their immune systems just aren't doing their job.
it's like their bodies are wearing out.
betty:
excuse me, dr. hydaker.
you ever see anything like this before?
never this severe.
the way it spreads - that's a new one for me.
what do you mean?
it works its way through families, but only the children, one sibling after another.
you mind if we interview a few of the kids?
they're not conscious.
none of them?
no.
can we talk to the parents?
if you think it'll help.
yeah, yeah. who was your most recent admission?
i should get back to my girls.
we understand that, and we really appreciate you talking to us.
now, you say mary's the oldest?
13.
okay, and she came down with it first, right?
and then... bethany the next night.
within 24 hours?
i guess.
look, i already went through all this with the doctor.
right. just a few more questions, if you don't mind.
how do you think they caught pneumonia?
were they out in the cold, anything like that?
no, we think it was an open window.
both times?
the first time, i don't really remember, but the second time for sure, and i know i closed it before i put bethany to bed.
so you think she opened it?
it's a second-story window, no ledge.
no one else could have.
you know this might not be anything supernatural.
it might just be pneumonia.
maybe. or maybe something opened that window.
i don't know, man. look, dad sent us down here for a reason.
i think we might be barking up the right tree.
i'll tell you one thing.
what?
that guy we just talked to - i'm betting it'll be a while before he goes home.
you got anything over there?
no, nothing.
yeah, me neither.
hey, dean.
dean: yeah?
you were right.
it's not pneumonia.
it's rotted.
what the hell leaves a handprint like that?
man: cheetara.
woman:
i am sorry to wake you, but jaga bids me to bring you to him.
john: all right.
you know the drill, dean.
if anyone calls, you don't pick up.
if it's me, i'll ring once and then call back.
you got that?
mm-hmm. don't answer the phone unless it rings once first.
come on, dude. look alive.
this stuff's important.
i know, it's just, we've done it like a million times, and you know i'm not stupid.
i know you're not, but it only takes one mistake.
you got that?
it's important that he join jaga on the flight deck.
all right, if i'm not back sunday night... call pastor jim.
lock the doors and windows, close the shades, and most important - watch out for sammy.
responsible for lion-o's welfare, snarf is.
i know.
all right, if something tries to bust in... shoot first, ask questions later.
that's my man.
what's up, jaga?
come closer.
what's happening to her?
what was that?
dean: i know why dad sent us here.
he's faced this thing before.
he wants us to finish the job.
so what the hell is a shtriga?
it's kind of like a witch, i think.
i don't know much about them.
well, i've never heard of it, and it's not in dad's journal.
dad hunted one in fort douglas, wisconsin, about 16, 17 years ago.
you were there.
you don't remember?
no.
i guess he caught wind that the thing's in fitchburg now and kicked us the coordinates.
so wait, this...
shtriga.
right, you think it's the same one dad hunted before?
yeah, maybe.
if dad went after it, why is it still breathing air?
because it got away.
got away?
yeah, sammy, it happens.
not very often.
i don't know what to tell you.
maybe dad didn't have his wheaties that morning.
what else do you remember?
nothing.
i was a kid, all right?
king or two queens?
two queens.
yeah, i bet.
what'd you say?
nice car.
hi. checking in?
yeah.
uh, do me a favor.
go get your brother some dinner.
i'm helping a guest.
two queens.
funny kid.
oh, yeah, he thinks so.
will that be cash or credit?
do you take mastercard?
mm-hmm.
perfect.
there you go.
thank you.
when's dad gonna get back?
tomorrow.
when?
i don't know.
he usually comes in late, though.
now, eat your dinner.
i'm sick of "scabetti-os."
well, you're the one who wanted them.
i want lucky charms.
there's no more lucky charms.
i saw the box.
okay, maybe there is, but there's only enough left for one bowl, and i haven't had any yet.
do you want the prize?
sir?
thanks.
well, you were right.
it wasn't very easy to find, but you were right.
a shtriga is a kind of witch.
they're albanian, but legends about them date back to ancient rome.
they feed off of spiritus vitae.
spirit what?
vitae.
it's latin.
it translates to "breath of life,"
kind of like your life force or essence.
didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies were wearing out?
it's a thought.
you know, she takes your vitality, maybe your immunity goes to hell, pneumonia takes hold.
anyway, shtrigas can feed off anyone, but they prefer - children.
yeah.
probably because they have stronger life force.
and get this - shtrigas are invulnerable to all weapons devised by god and man.
no, that's not right.
she's vulnerable when she feeds.
what?
if you catch her when she's eating, you can blast her with consecrated wrought irons, buckshots or rounds i think.
how do you know that?
dad told me.
i remember.
oh.
so, uh, anything else dad might have mentioned?
no, that's it.
what?
nothing.
okay, so, assuming we can kill it when it eats, we've still got to find the thing first, which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.
shtrigas take on a human disguise when they're not hunting.
what kind of human disguise?
historically, something innocuous.
it could be anything, but it's usually a feeble old woman, which may be how the witches-as- old-crones legend got started.
hang on.
what?
check this out.
i marked down all the addresses of the victims.
now, these are the houses that have been hit so far, and dead center - the hospital.
when we were there, i saw a patient, an old woman.
an old person, huh?
yeah.
in the hospital?
whew!
better call the coast guard.
well, listen, smartass, she had an inverted cross hanging on her wall.
betty:
good night, dr. hydaker.
see you tomorrow, betty.
try to get some sleep, aaron.
come on.
who the hell are you?
who's there?
you trying to steal my stuff?
they're always stealing around here.
no, ma'am, we're maintenance.
we're sorry.
we thought you were sleeping.
ah, nonsense.
i was sleeping with my peepers open.
and fix that crucifix, would you?
i've asked four damn times already.
"i was sleeping with my peepers open."
i almost smoked that old gal, i swear.
it's not funny.
oh, man, you should have seen your face, dean.
oh, yeah, laugh it on, man.
we're back to square one.
hang on.
hey, what's wrong?
my brother's sick.
the little guy?
pneumonia.
he's in the hospital.
it's my fault.
no, come on. how?
i should have made sure the window was latched.
he wouldn't have gotten pneumonia if the window was latched.
listen to me.
i can promise you that this is not your fault, okay?
it's my job to look after him.
michael.
turn on the "no vacancy" sign while i'm gone.
i've got denise covering room service, so don't bother with the rooms.
i'm going with you.
not now, michael.
but i got to see asher.
dean: hey, michael.
hey.
i know how you feel.
i'm a big brother, too.
but you got to go easy on your mom right now, okay?
aw, damn it.
i got it.
thanks.
you're in no condition to drive.
why don't you let me give you a lift to the hospital?
no, no, i couldn't possibly - no, no trouble.
i insist.
be good.
we're gonna kill this thing.
i want it dead.
you hear me?
dean: hey.
hey, how's the kid?
he's not good.
where you at?
i'm at the library, trying to find out as much as i can about this shtriga.
yeah, what do you got?
well, bad news.
i started with fort douglas around the time you said dad was there.
and?
same deal.
before that, there was ogdenville.
before that, north haverbrook and brockway.
every 15 to 20 years, it hits a new town.
dean, this thing is just getting started in fitchburg.
in all these other places, it goes on for months, dozens of kids, before the shtriga finally moves on.
kids just languish in comas, and then they die.
how far back does this thing go?
i don't know.
the earliest mention i could find is this place called black river falls back in the 1890s.
talk about a horror show.
whoa.
sam?
hold on.
i'm looking at a photograph right now of a bunch of doctors standing around a kid's bed.
one of the doctors is hydaker.
and?
and this picture was taken in 1893.
you sure?
yeah.
yeah, absolutely.
don't worry.
your son's in good hands.
i'm gonna take care of him.
so what's the cdc come up with so far?
we're still working on a few theories.
you'll know something as soon as we do.
well, nothing's more important to me than these kids.
hmm.
just let me know if i can help.
i'll do that.
sam: we should have thought of this before.
doctor's a perfect disguise.
you're trusted.
you can control the whole thing.
huh.
that son of a bitch.
i'm surprised you didn't draw on him right there.
yeah, well... first of all, i'm not gonna open fire in a freakin' pediatrics ward.
good call.
second, it wouldn't have done any good because the bastard's bulletproof unless he's chowing down on something.
and third, i wasn't packing, which is probably a really good thing 'cause i probably would have just burned a clip in him off of principle alone.
you're getting wise in your old age, dean.
you're damn right.
'cause now i know how we're gonna get it.
what do you mean?
the shtriga - it works through siblings, right?
right.
well, last night... it went after asher.
tonight it's probably gonna come after michael.
then we got to get him out of here.
no. no, that would blow the whole deal.
what?
yeah.
then you want to use the kid as bait?
are you nuts?
no. forget it.
that's out of the question.
sam, it's the only way - if this thing disappears, it could be years before we get another chance.
michael's a kid, and i'm not gonna dangle him in front of that thing like a worm on a hook.
dad did not send me here to walk away.
send you here?
he didn't send you here.
he sent us here.
this isn't about you, sam.
i'm the one that screwed up.
it's my fault.
there's no telling how many kids have gotten hurt because of me.
what are you saying, dean?
how is it your fault?
dean.
you've been hiding something from the get-go.
since when does dad bail on a hunt?
since when does he let something get away?
now, talk to me, man.
tell me what's going on.
fort douglas, wisconsin.
it was the third night in this crap room, and i was climbing the walls, man.
i needed to get some air.
...if ever i saw one.
command performance.
hey, kid.
we're closing up.
get out of the way!
sammy. sammy.
sammy.
you okay?
sam:
dad, what's going on?
are you all right?
what happened?
i- i just went out.
what?
j- just for a second.
i'm sorry.
i told you not to leave this room.
i told you not to let him out of your sight.
dad just grabbed us and booked, dropped us off at pastor jim's about three hours away.
by the time he got back to fort douglas, the shtriga had disappeared.
it was just gone.
it never resurfaced until now.
dad never spoke about it again.
i didn't ask.
but he, uh... he looked at me different, you know, which was worse.
not that i blame him.

don't.

i mean, how about one of us hides under the cover?

it's got to get close enough to feed. it'll see us.

yeah.
you'd take care of your little brother?
you'd do anything for him?
yeah, i would.
me too.
i'll help.
this camera has night vision on it, so we'll be able to see you as clear as day.

not yet.
michael, down!
mike, you all right?
yeah.
just sit tight.
dean!
dean: hey!
you okay, little brother?
it's okay, michael.
you can come on out.
hey, joanna, how's asher doing?
have you seen michael?
michael: mom!
mom!
hey!
how's ash?
i've got some good news.
your brother's gonna be fine.
really?
yeah, really.
no one can explain it.
it's, uh, it's a miracle.
they're gonna keep him in overnight for observation, but after that, he's coming home.
that's great.
how are all the other kids doing?

dr. travis says the ward's gonna be like a ghost town.

And keep me safe till morning light.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Good night, monkey-puss.
Daddy is Mommy coming home?
No, honey.
She's spending the night at the hospital with your sister.
Hey.
You sleep tight, now.
[wind BLOWS]
[tapping]
[WHlMPERlNG]
[SCREAMS]
DEAN:
Yeah.
You probably missed something, that's what.
Dude, I ran LexisNexis, local police records, newspapers.
I couldn't find a single red flag.
Are you sure you got the coordinates right?
Yeah. I double-checked.
It's Fitchburg, Wisconsin.
Dad wouldn't have sent coordinates if it wasn't important.
I'm telling you, I looked.
All I found was a big, steamy pile of nothing.
If Dad's sending us hunting for something, I don't know what.
-Maybe he'll meet us there.
-Yeah.
Because he's been so easy to find up to this point.
You're a real smart-ass, you know that?
I'm sure there's something in Fitchburg worth killing.
Yeah?
What makes you so sure?
Well, because I'm the oldest, which means I'm always right.
-No, it doesn't.
-lt totally does.
Well the waitress thinks that the local Freemasons are up to something sneaky but other than that, nobody's heard about anything weird going on.
Dean, you got the time?
Ten after 4.
Why?
What's wrong with this picture?
School's out, isn't it?
Yeah.
So where is everybody?
This place should be crawling with kids right now.
Sure is quiet out here.
Yeah. lt's a shame.
-Why's that?
-You know, kids getting sick.
It's a terrible thing.
How many?
Just five or six, but serious.
Hospital serious.
A lot of parents are getting pretty anxious.
They think it's catching.
Hm.
Dude.
Dude, I am not using this id.
-Why not?
-Because it says "bikini inspector" on it.
She won't look that close.
Hell, she won't even ask to see it.
It's all about confidence, Sammy.
Hi. I'm Doctor Jerry Kaplan, Center for Disease Control.
Can I see some id?
[SNORTS]
Yeah, of course.
Now, could you direct me to the pediatrics ward, please?
NURSE:
Well, just go down the hall.
Turn left.
Up the stairs.
See?
Told you it'd work.
Follow me.
It's upstairs.
SAM:
Dean.
DEAN:
Thanks for seeing us, Dr. Heidecker.
Well, I'm glad you guys are here.
I was just about to call CDC myself.
How'd you find out, anyway?
Oh, some G.P. I forget his name.
He called Atlanta and must've beat you to the punch.
So you say you've got six cases so far?
Yeah, yeah.
Five weeks.
At first, we thought it was garden variety bacterial pneumonia.
Not newsworthy.
But now....
Now what?
The kids aren't responding to antibiotics.
Their white cell counts keep going down.
Their immune systems just aren't doing their job.
It's like their bodies are wearing out.
NURSE:
Excuse me, Dr. Heidecker?
-Ever see anything like this before?
Never this severe.
The way it spreads, that's a new one for me.
-What do you mean?
-lt works its way through families but only the children, one sibling after another.
You mind if we interview a few of the kids?
They're not conscious.
-None of them?
-No.
Can we--?
Can we talk to the parents?
If you think it'll help.
Yeah, yeah.
Who was your most recent admission?
I should get back to my girls.
We understand that, and we really appreciate you talking to us.
Now, you say Mary's the oldest?
-Thirteen.
-Okay.
She came down with it first, right?
-And then--
-Bethany, the next night.
Within 24 hours?
I guess.
Look, I already went through all this with the doctor.
Right.
Now, just a few more questions, if you don't mind.
How do you think they caught pneumonia?
Were they out in the cold?
Anything like that?
-No, we think it was an open window.
-Both times?
The first time, I don't-- I don't really remember.
But the second time for sure.
-l closed it before I put Bethany to bed.
-So you think she opened it?
It's a second-story window, no ledge.
No one else could have.
You know, this might not be anything supernatural.
-Might just be pneumonia.
-Maybe.
Or maybe something opened that window.
I don't know.
Dad sent us here for a reason.
-l think we're barking up the right tree.
-l'll tell you one thing.
-What?
-That guy we just talked to I'm betting it'll be a while before he goes home.
You got anything over there?
No, nothing.
Yeah, me neither.
-Hey, Dean?
-Yeah.
You were right.
It's not pneumonia.
SAM:
It's rotted.
What the hell leaves a handprint like that?
JOHN:
All right.
You know the drill, Dean.
Anybody calls, you don't pick up.
If it's me, I'll ring once and then call back.
You got that?
Don't answer the phone unless it rings once first.
Come on, dude.
Look alive.
This stuff's important.
I know.
It's just we've gone over it, like, a million times, and you know I'm not stupid.
I know you're not, but it only takes one mistake.
You got that?
-All right, if I'm not back Sunday night--
-Call Pastor Jim.
Lock the doors, the windows.
Close the shades.
-And most important--
-Watch out for Sammy.
-l know.
-All right.
-Something tries to bust in?
-Shoot first, ask questions later.
That's my man.
-What's up, Jaga?
-Come closer, Lion-O.
DEAN:
I know why Dad sent us here.
He's faced this thing before.
He wants us to finish the job.
So, what the hell is a Shtriga?
It's kind of like a witch, I think.
They don't know that much about them.
I've never heard of it, and it's not in Dad's journal.
Dad hunted one in Fort Douglas, Wisconsin about 1 6, 1 7 years ago.
-You were there.
You don't remember?
-No.
Guess he caught wind it's in Fitchburg, and kicked us the coordinates.
-So wait, this....
-Shtriga.
Right.
You think it's the same one Dad hunted before?
Yeah, maybe.
If Dad went after it, why is it still breathing air?
-Because it got away.
-Got away?
-Yeah, Sammy. lt happens.
-Not very often.
I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe Dad didn't have his Wheaties that morning.
-What else do you remember?
-Nothing. I was a kid, all right?
King or two queens?
Two queens.
-Yeah, I bet.
-What'd you say?
Nice car.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Checking in?
-Yeah.
Do me a favor, go get your brother some dinner.
I'm helping a guest.
Two queens.
-Funny kid.
JOANNA:
Oh, yeah.
He thinks so.
-Will that be cash or credit?
-You take MasterCard?
-Mm-hm.
-Perfect.
Here you go.
When's Dad gonna get back?
Tomorrow.
-When?
-l don't know.
He usually comes in late, though.
Now, eat your dinner.
I'm sick of "scabetti-ohs."
Well, you're the one who wanted them.
I want Lucky Charms.
-There's no more Lucky Charms.
-l saw the box.
Okay, maybe there is.
But there's only enough left for one bowl, and I haven't had any yet.
Do you want the prize?
JOANNA:
Sir?
Thanks.
Well, you were right.
It wasn't very easy to find, but you were right.
A Shtriga is a kind of witch.
They're Albanian, but legends about them date back to ancient Rome.
They need off of spiritus vitae.
-Spirit what?
-Vitae.
It's Latin.
Translates to "breath of life."
Kind of like your life force or essence.
Didn't the doctor say the kids' bodies were wearing out?
It's a thought.
She takes your vitality, maybe your immunity goes to hell.
Pneumonia takes hold.
Anyway, Shtrigas can feed off anyone.
-But they prefer--
-Children.
Yeah.
Probably because they have stronger life force.
And get this:
"Shtrigas are invulnerable to all weapons devised by God and man."
No.
That's not right.
She's vulnerable when she feeds.
What?
If you catch her while eating, you can blast her with consecrated wrought iron.
Buckshots or rounds, I think.
-How do you know that?
-Dad told me.
I remember.
Oh.
So anything else Dad might've mentioned?
No, that's it.
What?
Nothing.
Okay.
So assuming we can kill it when it eats, we still gotta find the thing first which ain't gonna be a cakewalk.
Shtrigas take a human disguise when they're not hunting.
-What kind of human disguise?
-Historically, something innocuous.
Anything, but it's usually a feeble old woman which may be how the whole witches-as-old-crones legend got started.
-Hang on.
-What?
Check this out.
I marked down all the addresses of the victims.
These are the houses that have been hit so far.
-And dead center....
-The hospital.
The hospital.
When we were there, I saw a patient, an old woman.
-An old person, huh?
-Yeah.
In the hospital?
Whoo.
Better call the coast guard.
Listen, smart-ass.
She had an inverted cross hanging on her wall.
NURSE:
Good night, Doctor.
HElDECKER:
See you, Betty.
Try to get some sleep.
Who the hell are you?
Who's there?
You're trying to steal my stuff?
They're always stealing around here.
No, ma'am, we're maintenance.
We're sorry.
We thought you were sleeping.
Nonsense. I was sleeping with my peepers open.
[WOMAN CACKLES]
And fix that crucifix, would you?
I've asked four damn times already.
[SAM LAUGHS]
"I was sleeping with my peepers open"?
I almost smoked that old gal, I swear.
It's not funny.
Oh, man.
You should've seen your face, Dean.
Oh, yeah.
Laugh it up.
We're back to square one.
Hang on.
Hey.
What's wrong?
My brother's sick.
The little guy?
Pneumonia.
He's in the hospital.
It's my fault.
Oh, come on.
How?
I should have made sure the window was latched.
He wouldn't have got pneumonia if the window was latched.
Listen to me.
I can promise you that this is not your fault.
Okay?
It's my job to look after him.
Michael.
Turn on the "no vacancy" sign while I'm gone.
-l've got Denise covering room service.
-l'm going with you.
-Not now, Michael.
-But I gotta see Asher.
DEAN:
Hey, Michael.
Hey.
I know how you feel, okay?
I'm a big brother too but you gotta go easy on your mom right now, okay?
JOANNA:
Damn it.
-l got it.
-Here.
-Thanks.
You're in no condition to drive.
Let me give you a lift.
-No, I couldn't possibly--
-No, it's no trouble. I insist.
Thanks.
Be good.
We're gonna kill this thing.
I want it dead, you hear me?
[SAM DIALS PHONE]
DEAN:
Hey.
-Hey.
How's the kid?
-He's not good.
Where you at?
-I'm at the library.
Trying to find out as much as I can about this Shtriga.
-Yeah, what do you got?
-Well, bad news.
I started with-
- With Fort Douglas, around the time you said Dad was there.
-And?
-Same deal.
Before that, there was-- There was Ogdenville.
before that, North Haverbrook and Brockway.
Every 1 5 to 20 years it hits a new town.
Dean, this thing is just getting started in Fitchburg.
In all these other places, it goes on for months dozens of kids before the Shtriga finally moves on.
Kids just languish in comas and then they die.
-How far back does this thing go?
-I don't know.
Earliest mention I could find was this place called Black River Falls back in the 1 890s.
Talk about a horror show.
Whoa.
Sam?
Hold on.
I'm looking at a photograph right now of a bunch of doctors standing around a kid's bed.
One of the doctors is Heidecker.
-And?
-And this picture was taken in 1 893.
-You're sure?
-Yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.
Don't worry.
Your son's in good hands.
I'm gonna take care of him.
So, what's the CDC come up with so far?
We're still working on a few theories.
You'll know something as soon as we do.
Well, nothing's more important to me than these kids.
Just let me know if I can help.
I'll do that.
We should have thought of this before.
A doctor's a perfect disguise.
You're trusted.
You can control the whole thing.
That son of a bitch.
I'm surprised you didn't draw on him right there.
Yeah, well first of all, I'm not gonna open fire in a frigging pediatrics ward.
-Good call.
-Second, it wouldn't have done any good.
The bastard's bulletproof unless he's chowing down on something.
And third, I wasn't packing, which is probably a really good thing because I probably would've just burned a clip in him off the principle alone.
-You're getting wise in your old age.
-You're damn right.
Because now I know how we're gonna get it.
What do you mean?
-The Shtriga works through siblings?
-Right.
-Well, last night-- -lt went after Asher.
-Tonight it's gonna come after Michael.
-Then we gotta get him out of here.
-No, that would blow the whole deal.
-What?
-Yeah.
-Then you wanna use the kid as bait?
Are you nuts?
No.
Forget it.
That's out of the question.
It's the only way.
If this thing disappears, it could be years before we get a chance.
I'm not gonna dangle him in front of that thing like a worm on a hook.
Dad did not send me here to walk away.
Send you here?
He didn't send you here, he sent us here.
This isn't about you, Sam.
I'm the one that screwed up.
It's my fault.
There's no telling how many kids have gotten hurt because of me.
What are you saying, Dean?
How is it your fault?
[SAM sighs]
Dean you've been hiding something from the get-go.
Since when does Dad bail on a hunt?
Since when does he let something get away?
Now, talk to me, man.
Tell me what's going on.
Fort Douglas, Wisconsin.
It was the third night in this crap room and I was climbing the walls, man.
I needed to get some air.
Kid.
We're closing up.
[ROARS]
JOHN:
Get out of the way!
Sammy.
Sammy.
Sammy.
-You okay?
SAM:
Dad, what's going on?
JOHN:
You all right?
-What happened?
-l just went out.
-What?
-Just for a second. I'm sorry.
I told you not to leave this room.
I told you not to let him out of your sight.
Dad just grabbed us and booked.
Dropped us off at Pastor Jim's about three hours away.
By the time he got back to Fort Douglas, the Shtriga disappeared.
It was-- lt was just gone.
It never resurfaced until now.
You know, Dad never spoke about it again.
I didn't ask.
But he....
He looked at me different, you know?
Which was worse.
Not that I blamed him.
He gave me an order, and I didn't listen.
I almost got you killed.
-You were just a kid.
-Don't.
Don't.
Dad knew this was unfinished business for me.
He sent me here to finish it.
But using Michael....
I don't know, Dean.
I mean, how about one of us hides under the cover, you know?
We'll be the bait.
No, it won't work.
It's gotta get close enough to feed.
It'll see us.
Believe me, I don't like it, but it's gotta be the kid.
You're crazy.
Just go away, or I'm calling the cops.
Hang on a second.
Just listen to me.
You have to believe me, okay?
This thing came through the window, and it attacked your brother.
I've seen it.
I know what it looks like because it attacked my brother once too.
This thing, is it, like...?
It has this long, black robe?
You saw it last night, didn't you?
I thought I was having a nightmare.
I'd give anything not to tell you this but sometimes nightmares are real.
-So why are you telling me?
-Because we need your help.
My help?
We can kill it, me and him, it's what we do.
But we can't do it without you.
What?
No.
Michael, listen to me.
This thing hurt Asher and it's gonna keep hurting kids unless we stop it.
Do you understand me?
Well, that went crappy.
-Now what?
-What did you expect?
You can't ask an adult to do something like that, much less a kid.
[knocking ON DOOR]
If you kill it, will Asher get better?
Honestly, we don't know.
You said you're a big brother.
Yeah.
You'd take care of your little brother?
You'd do anything for him?
Yeah, I would.
Me too.
I'll help.
This camera has night vision on it, so we'll be able to see as clear as day.
-Are we good?
-Hair to the right.
SAM:
There, there.
michael:
What do I do?
Just stay under the covers.
michael:
And if it shows up?
Well, we'll be right in the next room.
We're gonna come in with guns.
So, soon as we do, you roll off this bed and you crawl under it.
-What if you shoot me?
-We won't shoot you.
We're good shots.
We're not gonna fire until you're clear, okay?
-Have you heard a gunshot before?
-Like in the movies?
It's gonna be a lot louder than in the movies.
So I want you to stay under the bed cover your ears, and do not come out until we say so, you understand?
Michael, you sure you wanna do this?
You don't have to, it's okay.
I won't be mad.
No, I'm okay.
Just don't shoot me.
We're not gonna let anything happen to you.
Promise.
[wind BLOWS]
What time is it?
It's 3.
You sure these iron rounds are gonna work?
Consecrated iron rounds.
And, yeah, it's what Dad used last time.
Hey, Dean, I'm sorry.
For what?
You know I've really given you a lot of crap for always following Dad's orders.
-But I know why you do it.
-Oh, God.
Kill me now.
Wait, look.
[COCKS GUN]
-Now?
-Not yet.
Hey!
Michael, down!
-Mike, you all right?
-Yeah.
Just sit tight.
Dean!
[GRUNTS]
DEAN:
Hey!
[YELLS]
You okay, little brother?
[hissing]
It's okay, Michael.
You can come on out.
-Hey, Joanna.
How's Asher doing?
-Have you seen Michael?
michael:
Mom!
Mom!
-Hey.
-How's Ash?
JOANNA:
Got some good news.
-Your brother's gonna be fine.
-Really?
Yeah, really.
No one can explain it.
It's-
- It's a miracle.
They're gonna keep him overnight, but after that, he's coming home.
-That's great.
-How are all the other kids doing?
Good.
Real good.
A bunch of them should be checking out in a few days.
Dr. Travis says the ward's gonna be like a ghost town.
Dr. Travis?
What about Dr. Heidecker?
Oh, he wasn't in today.
Must have been sick or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, must have.
So did anything happen while I was gone?
No, same old stuff.
-Okay.
You can go see Ash.
-Now?
Only if you want to.
I better get going before he hot-wires the car and drives himself.
It's too bad.
Oh, they'll be fine.
That's not what I meant.
I meant Michael.
He'll always know there are things out there in the dark.
Never be the same, you know?
Sometimes I wish that....
What?
I wish I could have that kind of innocence.
If it means anything, sometimes I wish you could too.
[ENGLISH SDH]
Stand, for what you believe in
Stand, for all that is right
Stand, when it's dark all around you
You can be that shining light
Stand, when troubles come calling
For what you believe in
Your gonna be all right
Stand, just reach deep inside you
And be that shining light
Stand
Dad, that's awesome.
That is the best song you've ever written.
I can't wait to record it.
What's the bad news?
Bad news?
What are you talking about?
It's a great song.
Thank you, Lilly.
You know, I've always liked her.
Don't change the subject.
Every time he has bad news he tries to soften it up with a great song.
Best of Both Worlds, I had to get braces.
This Is The Life, Jackson decided not to go to sleep away camp.
Pumpin' Up The Party, my goldfish died.
When my goldfish died, my mom flushed it down the toilet.
I'll never forget her comforting words.
"Get over it, Oliver, it's a stinking fish. "
That explains so much.
Come on, Dad, just tell me.
Trust me, I can handle it.
Your cousin Luann is coming to visit.
Who wants pie?
Miley?
- Miley?
- What kind of pie?
Come on, Mile.
Don't forget that wonderful, wonderful song that I just wrote you, that you love so much.
Stand, for what you believe in
Stand
When does her broomstick land?
Come on now, Mile.
Now, let's don't start this again.
She's a good kid.
Let's not forget who pulled you out of that well when you were just six.
Let's not forget who pushed me in.
Hey, that was an accident.
Sometimes kids do stuff without thinking.
Got it.
Stupid fly.
I didn't plan that, but there you go.
I can't believe this.
Halloween is two days away and you're making me share my bathroom with the Princess of Darkness?
If Luann's coming, I'm sleeping over at Lilly's.
Oh, come on, Mile.
Now, listen, you guys have grown up.
She's grown, you've grown, you're a lot alike.
How can you say that?
I am nothing like that horrible, ugly witch.
Howdy, cuz!
Well, doggies!
This is one humdinger of a shack!
Comeon!
You get the limo out front
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color
Yeah, when you're famous it can be kind of fun
It's really you but no one ever discovers
Who would have thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar?
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out, take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together
And you know that it's the best of both worlds
Uncle Robbie, Daddy said that these were your favorite Halloween cookies.
I made them myself.
Pecan crunchies!
Sweet nutty niblets.
Hey, you churned your own butter, didn't you?
Is there any other way?
- Whatever you do, don't eat that.
- Why not?
Because it was made by the devil's little helper.
You are being ridiculous.
- Lilly!
- Oh, please.
Next you're gonna be saying,
"She sees dead people. "
You know, it's amazing how much you and Miley look alike.
Always have.
When we were young'uns, you know, before she was Hannah Montana, she was in the Little Miss Tater pageant, but I had to take her place before the talent part 'cause she got all nervous and barfy.
I wasn't nervous, she slipped me some bad catfish.
She's always been jealous of me because I can sing and she can't.
What'd she do for the talent?
Pig calls.
Man, I miss Tennessee.
Boy, she cooks, she calls pigs.
- Where have you been all my life?
- Oh, you.
Mamma warned me about you handsome Californy fellers.
Oh, you, too.
Didn't you say you named your pet pig Luann?
Yep.
And now you know why.
Oh, this is pathetic.
Dad, every year we put up the same stupid decorations and all my friends laugh at us.
I don't know, I think these are pretty gruesome.
Look out, it's a spider!
It's in your hair.
It's crawling in your ear.
It's on your shoulder.
Boo.
Pathetic.
Could we at least get something halfway decent this year?
I mean, our Christmas decorations are scarier than this.
Hey, just because one of Santa's eyes fell out doesn't make him any less jolly.
This stuff scares 6-year-olds.
It's not like we're gonna find something that scares us.
Stewart, someone shoved your magazines through my mail slot.
Hmm.
I'm guessing that would be the mailman.
What's with the Halloween decorations?
Or should I say Hallo-weenie decorations?
Your winking Santa was scarier than this.
You know, I was hoping this year you'd be a little competition for me.
But I was wrong.
Dad, are you just gonna let him get away with that?
Don't worry about it, Son, it's a holiday.
We're not gonna get sucked into his little game.
Said the loser!
Don't go challenging me, Dontzig.
Oh!
I'm shaking.
Well, take it outside.
I don't have earthquake insurance.
Save the jokes, Goldilocks.
You're gonna need a sense of humor when all the kids see how "unscary" your house is and they start pelting it with eggs, which would be an improvement over this paint job.
That's it, he's crossed the line.
He insulted my hair.
Get in the car, Son.
We're gonna put the "boo" in Malibu.
Yes!
It's gonna be a hair-raising experience.
I don't know why you're making such a big deal about your cousin.
Luann seems really nice.
Yeah, and a Venus flytrap seems like a pretty plant until it throws you down a well.
Trust me, underneath those little piggy tails, little tiny horns.
Okay, not to sound like your dad, but maybe you should give her a chance, bud.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I hear the ice cream truck a-ringing and I want me a fudgie buddy.
- Okay, that was creepy good.
- Thank you.
Now, would it kill you to open up a little and at least try to be friends with her?
Hey, Traci's having that big Halloween party tomorrow night.
- Why don't we take her with us?
- No way.
I ain't letting that pig calling, butter churning, evil-doing hayseed anywhere near the Hannah world.
Would you stop calling her names?
Well, howdy, cuz.
I found you this pretty shell over by the tide pools.
Yeah, pretty.
A pretty good place to hide a poisonous hermit crab.
What are you doing?
I'm ruining your "little plan" to poison me and throw me down a well again!
Miley, stop, there's nothing in there.
I was just trying to be nice to y'all.
See how clever she is?
She tricks me into accusing her of something that she didn't do so I would look stupid.
Well, it worked.
You look pretty stupid.
I told you, she's an evil genius.
Hey, Jackson.
Oh, man, it's not scary enough.
It needs something.
But what?
Think, think.
Hey, Mile.
What happened at the beach today with you and Luann?
She's up in the guest room, she's awfully upset.
Well, it could have something to do with the fact that I accused her of trying to kill me.
Yeah, that has been known to offend a person.
- Do you really think I'm being unfair?
- Yeah, I do, bud.
But I also know you're awfully good at fixing things when you put your mind to it.
Okay, fine.
I'll go talk to her.
That's my girl.
If I'm not down in 10 minutes, check all the local wells.
Luann, you okay?
Yep, just packing up my bags and working on my plan for world domination.
Okay, look, maybe, possibly, it's conceivable that I haven't treated you completely fairly.
And I wanted to say I was sorry.
- Really?
Yeah.
The truth is, I always was a little jealous.
Well, I think it's time that we took the past and buried it.
Yeah, kind of like what we used to do with Aunt Pearl's roadkill ravioli.
Yeah.
There was always gravel in mine.
Yeah, she said it gave it that special crunch.
Well, if you still want to stay, there's a really great Hollywood Halloween party that I'd love to take you to.
You really want me to come with you'ins?
I really want you to come with me-ins.
I'm touched.
Hey, the limo's here to take us to Traci's party.
- Are you ready?
- Oh, yeah.
Let's do this.
- Where's Luann?
- Oh, she can't go.
She was at the beach boogie boarding all day and got a really bad sunburn.
Oh, I hate that.
But at least you two are friends now.
- Yep, best of pals.
Let's go.
- Okay.
Oh, I forgot my purse.
- I'll meet you out in the limo, okay?
- Okay.
Miley, Miley, Miley.
I can't believe you didn't see this coming.
Maybe if you wouldn't have wasted your time in singing classes and went to rodeo camp with the rest of us, you wouldn't be stuck in this situation.
What's that, girl?
You want Hannah to perform at the party?
Good idea.
You done got the best of both worlds
Oh, yeah.
Horrible, ain't it?
Wait till your fans hear that.
That'll do wonders for your career.
Happy Halloween, cuz.
Trick or treat!
Wait, kids, you forgot your candy!
Yes!
There is no way that Dontzig's house is scarier than ours.
What is wrong with you?
You're supposed to hand out candy, not traumatize my kid.
I'm sorry.
No, no, you don't understand.
See, it's just that...
We're just trying to be as scary as the guy next door.
You mean Mr. Happy Pumpkin Man?
- Who?
- Hey, hey, kids!
Oh, is mean old Mr. Stewart scaring you?
Yeah!
I don't believe this.
Why would somebody wanna scare little children?
It's sick.
I'm not surprised.
At Christmas they put out a one-eyed Santa.
- No!
- It's true.
I've seen it.
But it's Halloween.
And you're in Mali-boo.
Come on, kids.
Let's all go back to my house and everyone can have another ride on the pony.
He's Mr. Happy Pumpkin man
Giving out candy like no one can
He's Mr. Happy Pumpkin man
Well, Stewarts, you win.
You're the scariest.
And everybody in the neighborhood hates you.
I got you!
I'm Mr. Happy Pumpkin man
Wait up, kids!
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey!
Don't forget your candy!
Get away from our children!
I've got pepper spray!
Dad?
Jackson?
Oliver, I need your mom to drive me to a Halloween party now!
Yes, you can come.
I can't believe Luann would tie you up and try to ruin your life.
You know, this is gonna make my date tomorrow night with her a little awkward.
What are you gonna do when you see her?
I'm gonna rip off her wig and punch her in the nose.
Right now just help me find her.
It's not gonna be that hard.
Come on, she's gonna be the only one in there that looks exactly like me.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, this is gonna be a little harder than I thought.
Oh, boy, these gummy ghouls are better than Pappy's mountain taffy!
Man, you've been hanging around your cousin so much you're starting to talk like her.
Stop loading up on candy.
People are watching.
Well, of course they are.
I'm a celebrity.
Hannah.
You've been here an hour and you haven't said a word about my little Hannah-ween surprise.
Oh, you mean everyone dressed like me?
Yeah, it's about as stupid as a vegetarian having breakfast at the Beef N' Waffle.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about stupid.
Just like your stupid little voice.
What's the matter, you got some candy corn stuck up in your nozzle?
I have a deviated septum.
And I own it.
What is wrong with you?
You've been acting weird since we got here.
It's like you want the whole party to hate you...
Oh, my gosh, you're Luann!
Well, it took you long enough, Lulu.
It's Lola.
Lilly, Lola, Lulu, you might as well go by Purple Head.
What do you use for conditioner, grape jelly?
Hey, waiter.
Fetch me some peanut butter, I'd like to make me a sandwich.
I gotta get you out of here before you blow Miley's secret.
Well, shut my mouth.
I wasn't even thinking about pulling this wig off till you done brought it up.
That'll really fix her wagon.
Good job, gumdrop.
I had a dream like this once.
Except the room was full of Jessica Simpsons and I had more than one chest hair.
Focus.
We have to find the real fake Hannah.
Ha!
I've got you!
I am not gonna let you ruin my best friend's life.
I am your best friend.
You can't fool me with that fake Miley accent.
I am Miley!
I have to go find Luann!
You're not going anywhere without your nose.
Lilly.
Lilly, she's telling the truth.
Oliver?
What are you doing here?
I needed his mom to drive me here 'cause you and Luann rode off in my limo!
- Miley?
- You think?
Sorry.
We gotta find her quick.
She's about to rip off her wig and blow your secret.
- She wouldn't.
- She would.
And she thought of it all herself.
Remember, no matter what she says, she's evil.
Looking for Hannah.
Not you.
Not you.
But, hi.
Not you, but, girl, aren't you styling.
Hey, folks, it's me, the real Hannah Montana!
I've got a little announcement for y'all.
You guys might want to get out your fancy Hollywood phone cameras for this one.
Hey, guys, I found her!
She's on stage!
Good work.
Hold on, guys, I got a little something stuck in my craw.
Bingo!
Well, she's gonna have a real hard time spitting with my fist in her mouth.
You can't!
You get into something with her, she might rip off your wig, too.
Have no fear, ladies, the masked musketeer has a plan.
Great.
My life is in the hands of Count Chesthair.
So, lookie here, y'all are about to see something you never expected to see, the other side, the other side, the other side of...
Look at that.
Magic.
And spitting.
Neat.
Why don't we have dessert now?
Bring out the Hannah banana cream pie!
You are so busted, Luann.
Guys, you grabbed the wrong one in the dark!
I'm Miley!
Nice try, you backwoods witch.
These are my best friends.
They're not gonna fall for that.
Tell her.
- You got any idea?
- Not a clue.
Guys, we have got to get her out of here before she reveals my secret.
You mean my secret.
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.
I know how to tell which is the real Miley.
- Both of you kiss me.
- Okay.
That's Miley.
And what has all this taught you?
That parents should believe their kids when they tell them their cousins are evil.
And?
That I should always take my cell phone when I leave the house in case my daughter gets tied up in her closet.
- And?
- I'm sorry.
But you don't have to worry about it much longer.
Your uncle's on his way here to pick Luann up.
They'll be gone tomorrow.
That doesn't give me much time to get her back.
Like I've always told you, an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
Stewart!
Stewart, you gotta help me!
Those candy grabbers are like piranha!
They're coming by the bus load!
It's like someone put an ad in the paper.
The paper?
That's way too slow.
If somebody wanted to get information out fast, they'd just run down Pacific Coast Highway with a bullhorn.
You didn't.
Oh, yes, I did.
Got you!
Okay, kids.
Come on down, don't be shy.
Curse you, Stewart!
Curse you!
Dad, what about revenge making the whole world blind?
I was teaching that to you, it's too late for me.
Hey, Dad, Dontzig's pony followed me home.
Can we keep him?
Please?
All I need is a really big litter box.
I'm just gonna take him up to my room, okay?
Hey, Miley, tell your cousin her daddy's here!
Put your drawers on, Robbie Ray, your brother's here!
Good to see you, too, Bobbie Ray.
Well, smack my goat and call me stupid, this sure is one humdinger of a shack you got yourself.
Stewart, I need that pony back, it's a rental.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Two Stewarts!
Is that that pain-in-the-keister neighbor you've been telling me about?
Yep.
- He sure runs fast, don't he?
- He sure does.
- Doggies!
- Doggies!
Previously on Wildfire...
Look me in the eyes and tell me you don't have any feelings for me anymore and that you just want to be friends.
I don't have feelings for you anymore and I just want to be friends.
I'm not sure where to go from here.
Nothing is what I thought it was.
I need to slow down.
Does that make sense?
-Yeah.
Give me something of my own.
The pick of four horses from the racing stable.
I have to buy this horse.
- Big step.
Help me to start my stable.
- Maybe I will.
Okay, Rebecca, where else have you been a waitress?
- Nowhere.
But you worked with a cash register before?
- Never.
- Okay you're hired!
My dad pretty much cut me off.
He gave a choice between family and...
- Kris...
I chose her.
I think I did the right thing.
Everybody knows that you broke up with Kris Furillo.
You're looking for some mindless, shallow fling to get over Kris.
I'm no rebound girl.
I was starting to think you were avoiding me.
No.
Not really in my power.
Hey.
- Hey.
God he cracks me up.
I swear he knows it's Friday.
The long slow distance and he barely wakes up.
Who is that?
- First score Pablo's Kentucky shopping trip.
Belladonna.
She's a Derby prospect.
She trampled the start and then bend for the tracks.
Tough girl, huh?
She's got Metal Warrior in her veins.
And he was really nasty.
Metal Warrior?
He's like royalty?
Mama is gonna breed it with that.
Aladar is descendant of the Holly ranch.
It seems you're not really her type.
Better keep it away from her.
Not a good idea mixes breeding mares with racing Colts.
It's a distraction.
It's so unfair.
He can't only have fun while racing.
Clashed with other mares.
I got to get him out of there.
- I'll help.
Be careful!
Get out!
Easy, easy!
Matt!
WILDFIRE
Jean?
In the kitchen.
Hey, baby.
You want some coffee?
- I could use a little antioxidant.
Jean, I have to ask you an important question.
How do you really feel about sipping an 1994 Opus One Cabernet?
Opus One?
Phew.
While dazzling out over a vineyard covered hill side?
Nestled in a thick white terry robe.
I hate those.
- Still warm from your massage.
Boneless before heading off to a fantastic meal,
Followed by... a little opera.
- Opera?
Oh my god I've always wanted to go to this resort!
How did you know?
It's life as a Cabernet weekend.
I wish I could.
Okay bring Caesar over, but be careful.
Let's go.
Don't be too close.
Okay, that's enough!
That's enough!
Caesar is a teaser.
Poor guy they brought him here to see if they make the mares
And he never gets anything solved.
The worst job ever.
So, Belladonna is not in heat?
Well, the ultrasound says she's close.
I wouldn't want to be that stallion.
Hey, how is my baby girl?
- Oh did you find another baby?
Who is the lucky mother this time?
Do you remember that Colt you like the Bold River?
Yeah.
Reliable power and speed.
Breeding is such a crap.
Cheap bloodline is like that, really betting.
I've found another Colt on the internet with the same lines.
Called Ismael.
I've never heard of this seller before.
- You can't pretend to know everybody in racing.
Come on, honey, internet sales?
I mean, why would they run the Colt down the Keeneland some place it wouldn't be seen?
I mean, there's proper channels to do this is kind of thing why all the mystery?
It's not mystery.
It's the way the things are done now.
Proper channels are history dad.
Sweetie, if thing sound too good to be true, in my experience it is.
There are a lot of tricks out there.
Would you buy a Mercedes from someone you didn't know?
Come on, that's settled, forget all this foolishness, come with me to the Florida Derby, would you?
Foolishness?
You know what?
I will.
I'd love to come to the Florida Derby with you.
- Terrific.
Yeah, for delivery.
No tomorrow afternoon.
Okay.
Earl.
Thanks.
Bye.
Honeymoon suite?
Is that the best available?
That's the only free?
Okay, great, I'll take it.
Yeah confirmation number.
Great.
Thanks a lot.
Do you know how much I wish I could go?
You designed my ideal weekend.
Except for the opera.
Let me ask you something, when was the last time you get away?
Please, baby, please baby!
Please!
- Stop it!
Pablo is gone.
Who am I supposed to trust to handle all of this without me?
Come on!
Can't you be the nice guy we all know you are?
So your mom and Charlie they could go!
I'm already covering for Pablo.
Come on...
She's your mom.
This would mean a lot to her.
Primrose is the sweetest mares.
I can't believe that evil Belladonna picked at her.
She'll be fine.
I'll cold hose her legs every couple of hours and put ice packs in between.
And I promise
By morning there will be no swelling.
Look at this!
A Jockey who wants to cold hose a horse.
Hey I'm thrilled that Kris is still willing to help out.
Okay, do me a favor and put we all out of this misery say yes.
Kris will cover for me and cover for Pablo.
It's not a good time.
Just go, okay?
Before I change my mind.
Impressive work ethic.
Watch out or I'll make you employer of the month.
It comes with a cool trophy.
A bronze apron.
Dad would be so proud.
He thinks I'm a spoiled litle rich girl who doesn't know tying her own shoes.
I know you're thinking you can use my insecurities for your own ends.
That's not what I was thinking.
A large man with the keg is about to walk through that door.
Let's help him.
I'll take that.
You guys...
Take, and take, and take.
I will love you anyway.
You're looking alive.
Massages,
Treats, chiropractors.
Having the best food and medical care.
And do I even get to thank you?
I really miss Junior.
Don't tell him that.
There's so many little things I want to tell him, like, how spring you were trotting this morning
Or how amazing the stars were last night.
But I can't.
I have to keep the focus.
Todd has exams for the weekend, and our veterinarian is out of town, so we're using dr.
Schuller, okay?
We got it.
- Okay.
They got it.
Let's go.
- Okay.
- Bye, bye.
Thanks.
Bye guys, have fun.
You swore off for all guys or just Jr.?
Before 2 g.
I was a criminal.
One dumb move and I can end up back there.
So a guy is a dumb move?
- Yeah pretty much.
Ouch!
-What is true.
I mean,
A lot of girls I know have their lives way more in shackles than I do.
They really go to school have a decent job and then one guy comes around and...
"Oh, he's the one.
He's really different.
He really loves me."
And next thing they know they're either pregnant broke, or both.
So, yeah love makes girls do stupid things.
Ask Primrose.
You look awesome.
- I'm off to the Florida Derby.
- Right now?
Dad has got the jet.
He thinks I'm going along to help him,
But really I'm doing some scanning on my own.
- Nice.
Remember how you said you'd help me set up my barn?
- Yeah?
I want you go and see this horse.
If you like it, buy it.
This is a check of 20 grand .
- I cashed some stocks I wasn't supposed to touch.
And 20,000 that's what you have to get them to get it down to.
Right now the price they're asking is 30
The address is in there.
They expect you tomorrow morning.
I made a motel reservation for you.
I can't tomorrow.
My mom is out with Charlie,
And I told her I would help Kris here.
- Matt, please.
Everyone is playing me left and right.
My dad, Isabel, even Junior.
I need to know that there's one person I can trust.
One person who's there for me.
- I'm here for you.
Just not right now.
Look, my dad can't be right.
He thinks that this horse is no good, but I know that it is.
I just want you to go buy him and prove him wrong.
There are other buyers.
It can't wait.
Alright.
Let me talk to Chris, okay?
-Thank you!
You leaving?
I can't screw up with Davis.
And Dani really needs me.
So what do you want me to say Don't go?
-You could say that.
And then I'd be the bitch.
-You know you would but it would be better if you say yes.
You'll be fine here.
You have the whole place taken care.
-Then fine go.
I can't believe I manage the farm.
I feel like Penny Chenery.
I know you're wondering who Penny Chenery was.
She was the owner of the Secretariat horse.
He was at one time champion, but we would have won.
So while you're sitting on and sipping cocktails I have a million things to do.
Don't move.
Norm!
Clay!
What do you think has the weekend off?
But who was in the stables?
Oh god.
Oh god.
So much for cold splashing.
Swimming.
Hey!
You should have to agree there!
Shall perish!
Ma kidding!
Party queen?
- That's my nickname.
You found this title how?
The talent portion of the contest, throwing legendary parties in my dorm.
Maybe you can work your magic in this place.
Yeah let's see how we stand committed.
Shall we?
First:
lighting.
- Checked.
Flyers.
- Check
- Stripper Pool.
I'm kidding.
Vodka, tequila, jello...
For shots.
- I forgot this is a class establishment.
Speaking of which, the celebutantes are coming by around six.
- The celebutantes?
One of the biggest punk bands.
This could cause your crown, party queen.
One question.
How are we going to get all of this done by morning?
Divide and conquer.
Hello?
- Junior, hey it's Kris.
I have a huge favor to ask.
Can you come to help me at Raintree?
No.This is a really bad time.
Hey, wait!
What's wrong with people?
I think it was a pen fuel.
Do you know what you're looking at?
- No.
Where's the tow truck?
I missed my facial.
- Let's call them again.
I must tell you we were completely full.
But Miss Davis was most persuasive.
Yeah, she can be pretty persuasive.
Adam, could you show Mr. Ritter to his room.
Honeymoon suite.
Yes.
-Thank you.
Callmeat 6.
We canpretend that we're there together.
Thanks for everything.
Dani.
So, are you naked?
Mr Ritter?
-Yeah?
It's Jake Smith.
Just call me Ismael's owner.
-Yeah?
I've got another buyer who wants to come by late at night.
- Okay.
So If you want this horse, you better come up now.
Hold on, I'll be right there .
We have a reservation it's under Giacomo Puccini.
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Puccini, but I don't see a room under that name.
It's got be.
I booked it yesterday.
Honeymoon Suite.
It's all occupied.
I have a Confirmation number in my wallet.
We really do have a reservation.
Do you have any rooms available?
- I'm afraid not.
We have a confirmation.
My wallet...
I don't have my wallet.
The tow truck?
Just any room so we can clean up and change our clothes.
I'm truly sorry sir, but we are full, as is everyone else.
The festival you know.
Life is like a Cabernet.
You have 15 minutes.
Not that I'm not Superman or anything but it's will go a lot quicker with the two of us.
I was afraid you'd say that.
So, this is part of being friends?
If there was anyone else I could call...
- Next time call that number.
I appreciate.
I owe you.
Yeah, like a kidney or two.
It's has to be a good home.
With nice people.
Well, Dani loves horses.
You know Ismael is a baby.
Was unproven.
He haven't seen no starting gates,
Riding equipment or a winner circle.
I'm prepared to offer you $15.
All I'll take it's $ 25.
The check is written for $ 20.
He'll be loved all the time.
Alright, you got yourself a deal.
You take good care of him now.
I promise.
Let's go to my pickup.
And sign some papers.
Scooteru!
- Yeah, boss?
Put Ismael on this man's trailer.
- Yes, boss.
Oh god!
- You got it?
Yeah, I think.
That was the last bale of hay.
I didn't know you were that strong.
- Me?
You could tear me apart.
I don't know many girls who could pull a bale of hay.
You know I don't know any guys who would do this.
Maybe you need more friends.
Or maybe I need to be nicer to the friends I already have.
This is so pretty!
- The theater is basically brand new.
Snacks.
Can we bring snacks into the theater?
- I'm not entirely sure.
Tickets!
Tickets!
Tickets!
- I got them right here in my...
Wallet?
I'm sorry.
The show is sold out.
I can't let you in without a ticket.
Perfect.
- I'm sorry.
I should get back to the club.
-Wait!
Please, don't leave.
Hi, Raintree.
- Hey Kris, it's Jean.
Hi, Jean.
How's it going?
We're having a terrific time.
How is everything there?
Everything is great.
We're totally on top of it.
-Thanks.
Kris.
Don't tell me...
The Raintree is attacked by locusts?
No the clouded doom seems to be stuck over us.
But life is a Cabernet.
- Or whatever this is.
Come, I want to show you something.
I think this is the exact spot.
I walked all the way around the theater.
And If I'm right, the acoustics right here is perfect.
We will hear every word.
That's not gonna help me understand any better.
- I know opera isn't really your thing.
No, no I love it.
Everything but the singing.
- No, you see.. it don't...
Think about the voices differently.
It's like all the things we say that come out flat when we talk,
They get shaped into feelings.
- Loud feelings.
Passion is hard to let out.
But it should be.
It should take you up above language.
It's like the words come out mixed with this huge music,
And it goes into you and become part of who you are and what is in need to say.
It's really hard to explain.
You did pretty well.
Just listen.
Hey, you've reached Junior Davis, leave a message.
Junior, you better get back here as soon as you get this actually,
The band for tomorrow night... you double booked.
Where are you?
What was that?
- A horse.
Can you believe it?
It was Wildfire.
Fine.
Just leave them.
And now they're in a play withing the play.
It's all starting to become real.
He sighs and he's calling a name.
He's really close to hanging, it's right underneath her window.
And he's aching to kiss her sweet little face.
Dear wonderful face.
This is Dani Davis, please leave a message.
Hey, baby.
You were right.
It's like clock work.
I can't wait to show you how.
I can't wait to see you.
He's so beautiful.
You were right.
He's a great buy.
Did you hear him?
He wants to say hi to its new owner.
Hey, buddy.
Yes you're a good boy.
I can not believe the drive down here Unbelievable, the price of gas...
I mean
I gotta go.
Shoe grease!
It was a scam!
Go back!
Dammit!
Oh my god!
I have to get to the club!
- I'm really...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
We shouldn't let it go.
That was stupid.
I'm really...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Wildfire!
Thank you so much.
You are the best.
You totally saved my butt.
Thanks for fixing this band thing for me.
I'm glad the show went well last night.
Hit again.
I owe you one.
I want so far to let you out.
Look, it was a one time thing.
A friend in need.
It won't happen again.
Tonight is gonna be great.
I promise.
Yeah I'll be there...
Wait.
Hold on.
Yeah?
- Hey.
Unbelievable.
No!
This is the last time.
Can you go check on pasture.
He likes the grass out there.
I haven't slept with a boy in a car since high school.
I haven't slept in a car with anybody.
Never did even in high school.
At all.
How old were you...
When I...
- Yeah.
I was a slow starter.
I was a junior in college. 17.
My god!
It's not being a slow starter.
I was 17 when I was a junior in high school.
Yeah, it's all coming back to me.
Chip McMaster.
Yes!
He came to see me from college.
I had the biggest crush on him.
And he was gorgeous.
Gorgeous?
But you know what?
Stupid.
That's so sad.
You know, when things go wrong in my marriage, Pete and I always blamed each other.
For what?
Fate?
You know, whatever happens, it's all about how you look at it.
And whom you look at.
Dani, we got screwed.
Dani, we got screwed.
Your dad was right.
Hi this is Matt Ritter.
You can not answer it.
He went to the Foreign Legion
Wildfire!
Where are you, horse?
Wildfire!
Hey, Jake.
How is it going?
Did you see who won?
I haven't time to look yet.
You know that saddle I've tossed around?
-Yeah I do.
I have the money.
- Got beat me up.
I have the money.
- Let's have a look.
Tell prices.
Okay.
You got a deal, Jake.
Jake!
Would you like a receipt?
- Keep it.
- See you.
Oh, no, Wildfire!
Junior!
Junior!
One blow and will break his leg.
We got get him out.
- Don't worry I got it.
Watch out, almost killed one guy.
Oh God.
Come on, Wildfire.
Junior, grab it.
Come on.
Good boy.
Good morning.
We need coffee please.
Would you have any espresso intravenous?
Just coffee.
What are you doing here?
How was the opera?
- Definitely more pressing question.
Please.
- Don't...
You're supposed to be home being me.
I wanted a break?
- Don't be cute.
What the hell could possibly be so important that you would leave Raintree?
Something came up and I had to go, trust me.
- Trust you?
How the hell am I supposed to trust you when you pull something like this?
And who the hell's horse is that?
Belladonna is fine.
In fact she seems really calm.
How's Wildfire?
There aren't any marks on him, but I mean what if he losts his focus?
What if he no longer want to race because he has only sex in his mind?
So Junior, you and Primrose step aside.
I'm going to ride next and see if he stay focused.
I don't know about you, but I feel used.
Go on, go on.
It seems he got his focus back.
I can't wait to take a shower.
It wasn't exactly the perfect getaway I planned...
It was perfect.
- More like a good story for us to tell one day.
What?
You know, our story.
You know, couples have stories about how they met, they get together...
This is crazy!
I gotta to get rid of this.
Jean...
I'll call you later.
Real surprise.
It's beautiful.
Congratulations!
I'll give you 35 for him right now.
- No way.
I can't wait for my internet horse to beat your proper channels.
We'll see about that.
You did it!
- Yes I did.
I needed you and you came through.
- You know it.
Mom and Kris were upset.
Why?
- Well, they think I should be on call 24x7.
Matt will do this, Matt will do that.
You know what?
I have my own plans.
Yes you do.
He's so gorgeous!
And what a bull's eye.
You know what, Ritter?
-What?
We make a good team.
-Yeah?
Hey, Junior!
- Thank you guys for coming.
Rebecca!
This place runs itself, right?
Thank you, Kathleen.
No, I'm sorry.
I'll pick her up later this afternoon.
Okay, Bye.
Belladonna refused the stud.
There are only two reasons a mare would refuse the stallion.
One she's not in heat, between us she was or... she's already pregnant.
But how?

It's alive!
This here's my town, and I won't let you take it.
You just try and stop us.
All in a day's work, kids.
Kids, what are you doing?
!
Help!
Paper cut!
Hollywood's turned everything... from old TV shows to video games... to theme park rides into movies.
Now they're tackling board games... guaranteeing audiences will be unbored this summer.
In a town torn apart by crime, the heroes bite back!
- You boys sure are hungry.
- Hungry for justice!
A hippo playing pool.
I'd like to see that.
Fine.
I'll break.
It's a race!
Help!
Hippos!
It's a chase!
So, hurry up and feed your face.
I always knew them hippos was trouble.
Officer John Chutes was born to be a cop.
Officer Mikey Ladders was born to be wild.
You weren't just robbing one man, you know.
You gotta think of the socio-economic realities of the situation.
Sorry, am I punching you too hard?
But this summer...
Officer Chutes and Officer Ladders are born to be...
Partners?
!
OK, well, let's just do what we do best.
You kids need to give me some respect!
My dodge balls!
Grandma's ashes!
Ben Stiller.
Owen Wilson.
Yeah, OK.
I'm enthusiastic.
This is good.
This is nice spaghetti.
Chutes and Ladders.
Also, catch Ben Stiller in the following movies this summer.
All we need to do is get past security... disable the alarms, break into the vault... and carry $400 billion in untraceable bills out of the casino.
I think I got a way.
That's what I call a royal flush!
Jackpot, daddy-o!
Slip 'n' Slide:
The Movie.
This summer, action is all wet and plastic and you can slide on it.
Massage chair... if we lived in Canada, I would make you my bride.
- Skeletor!
- Oh, no.
It's Mo-Larr, Eternian Dentist.
You missed your 10:15 appointment!
I'm busy, Mo-Larr.
You have an impacted wisdom tooth, Skeletor!
It has to come out!
I'm a talking skull!
What do I care if...
You know what?
The hell with this.
The boss man says his appointment is cancelled!
I'm all out of mint flavor.
How come beast-man got the dental floss... and I got the fucking drill in my eye?
!
Success!
You son of a bitch!
Comes with everything you see here.
¤ M-e-a-t m- a-c-h-i-n-e ¤
¤ Meat machine, meat machine, all right, break ¤
So, I threw the Senate at him.
The whole Senate.
True story.
Oh, my God.
That is so funny.
You made it come out of my nose.
Go for Papa Palpatine.
You have a collect call from...
Darth Vader.
I gotta take this.
Hold on.
Vader, how's my favorite Sith?
Just slow down.
What do you mean they blew up the Death Star?
!
Fuck, oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Who's they?
!
What the hell is an Aluminum Falcon?
!
OK, OK.
So, who's left?
Are you shitting me?
!
Well, where are you?
!
Wait a sec.
You've been flying around for two weeks trying to get a signal?
You must smell like feet wrapped in leathery, burnt bacon.
I'm sorry.
I thought my Dark Lord of the Sith... could protect a small thermal exhaust port only two meters wide.
That thing wasn't even fully paid off yet!
Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to my credit?
Hang on.
I got another call.
What?
!
I'm very busy right now!
Well, where are they going?
All right.
Just get me a turkey club.
Coleslaw, I guess.
I'm not even gonna eat it.
What are you getting?
No, see, I always order the wrong thing.
No, no, no.
I'll just stick with that.
OK, bye.
Wait, what?
Cherry coke.
Thanks.
Sorry about that.
What?
Just rebuild it?
!
Real fucking original!
And who's going to give me a loan, jack-hole, you?
!
You got an ATM on that torso Lite-Brite?
Get your 7'2" asthmatic ass back here... or I'll tell everyone what a whiney bitch you were... about Patomommi or Panda Bear or whatever the hell her name is!
Jeez!
He's crying.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't do that.
Just...
Look, you know, I'm just dealing with a lot of crap right now.
Death Star blown up by a bunch of fucking teenagers, you know...
I didn't mean to snap.
Just get back here.
OK.
OK, bye.
I...
Yeah.
I...
I love you, too.
And then this sap will be made into yummy maple syrup.
Now, what is wrong here?
Almost there.
Almost there.
This in the name of science, boy.
We gonna conduct an experiment up inside Uranus.
Now, squeal like a pig!
Pressure's down to 60.
Damn it!
He's losing too much blood.
Don't you die on me, you hear?
!
Nurse, get me more O-neg, stat!
- Feeling better?
- I feel great.
Finish him!
Good night, love bug!
You know, you gotta watch that flirting.
It'll get you into trouble!
Trouble.
What have you been sleeping on?
Pan-global oil keeps dumping sludge into the Atlantic Ocean.
That burns my ass!
Forget it, Ted.
There's nothing you can do.
Maybe I can't... but Captain Planet can!
Captain Planet!
Captain Planet!
Captain Planet!
Captain Planet!
- Where will we dump our sludge next?
- The Grand Canyon could hold a lot of it.
It sure could.
Let's sludge the hell out of the Grand Canyon.
- Is that Ted Turner?
- I think it is.
What the hell's he doing?
He's on one of those zip-lines.
Is that what they're called, zip-lines?
- Well, I always thought it was...
- Captain Planet!
- You got glass in my eye!
- And my foot in your balls!
Captain Planet!
What do you want, Mr. Turner?
!
Just sign this pledge not to dump any more sludge and I'll let you go!
- OK, OK!
- This appears to be in order.
Captain Planet!
Protect the environment or I'll fucking kill you!
Captain Planet!
You heard it here, folks.
The biggest catch-phrase of the new millennium... will be "Captain Planet!" My friends say it all the time.
And then kick each other in the nuts.
That's awesome!
As the opening credit sequence basically tells you... you are the chicken forced to watch this shit.
Am I getting paid for this?
If I had a toy of myself, I'd have to make out with it.
Twinkie the kid.
That's topical.
Here's another great thing.
We're gonna do movie parodies.
Does the world need another Owen Wilson
- Ben Stiller movie?
The answer is an emphatic yes.
Chutes and Ladders.
Are you kidding me?
!
A travesty!
This is comedy to these people.
Yes, yes, yes, and more yes.
When your career was on the down slope, you'd to go to infomercials.
Now, you go to Robot Chicken.
The best Robot Chicken ever.
Couldn't be a more opposite statement.
That show stinks.
It's not gay, it's masturbation.
People watch this on television!
They chose this!

The best Robot Chicken ever.
Couldn't be a more opposite statement.
That show stinks.
It's not gay, it's masturbation.
People watch this on television!
They chose this!
All right.
All right, then, Mr. Jarvis, let's get underway with the interview here, okay?
Uh, we'll be taping this.
It was... the most dangerous time.
Wild time.
Unpredictable.
As fierce as the Windego... yet with the curiosity of a wildcat.
Thirsty for blood.
It was the greatest of my many theories.
Yet it resembled my greatest success.
Yeah.
Right.
If you don't mind, we're gonna begin.
Okay?
Let's just start simply, okay?
It shows here in the first official recording of this asylum, that would be January 1911, that you were an intern working under doctor...
Actually, we don't have that.
Do we have the date correct, Mr. Jarvis?
His eyes, his hands.
How could we have known?
Mr. Jarvis, is the date correct?
Is the date correct?
Do not rush me, you cunt!
I have to tell you, the beginnings of this asylum is to root way back into dark, forgotten seasons back when the primordial ooze still boiled at the dawn of time.
Its history is darker than the Middle Ages, my friend, darker than the bottom tier of hell.
You see... this asylum wasn't built in a day, nor did it get the way it is now because of its founders.
The asylum was built on fear, fear of the unknown, its darkest origins speaking in the mind of an inbred named Joe Slaader of the Catskill Mountains.
Sleep.
Sleep now, baby girl.
I can't, Daddy, I can't.
You must to sleep!
None live with no sleep.
We sleep, Amducious come and make us free.
Sleep!
Sleep, sleep, sleep!
Sleep!
In him, we gave meaning to what we did here.
In him, we justified our places here, justified... our dirtiest deeds.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time is over now.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time's over.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time's over now.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time is over now.
I have blood!
Follow the blood!
Must be dead!
No!
No!
No kill!
Find Joe, then ask Amducious!
Well, well, well.
Seems someone's already formed a posse.
Hello, boys.
Must be something really important goin' on here for you guys to be away from your homes.
Mighty important for you to stop fuckin' your sisters for more 'n a minute.
We find blood.
You find blood, do you?
Well, no shit.
We found gallons of it in your cabin down yonder.
We have a missing inbred, a missing head, and now I got a posse of you searchin' for the same thing we are.
You want to explain that, you stupid son of a bitch?
You make me sick.
My stomach turns at the sight of you.
We're takin over this search.
If you want to dispute that, we'll just arrest you for incest, bigamy, huh?
Conspiracy?
Just for general fuckin' ugliness.
We go back.
No!
You are comin' with us.
No!
We no abide!
You will abide, and you will come with us!
There's three dead, one missing...
one of your own.
And that's enough for us to turn your campsite upside down.
Sir!
What?
Dear God...
Sweet Jesus.
You go into town today, Joe?
I guess we'll know that I sleep.
You be careful.
Don't say bad things.
You sleep.
Oh, I hate the bad things.
I hate the bad things.
You see, my dear, I've always believed that human thought is the product of atomic or molecular motion.
And that motion can be converted into... to ether waves, like heat, light, electricity.
It's much like my device here.
With the energy from the muscle tissue in my arm transferred to the crank, to the fuses, to the wires...
I am able to harness electricity itself.
And what I propose is that, we can harness human thought in the exact same way.
Given the most recent developments in electro-shock therapy,
I think it's obvious that science is on the cusp of a major breakthrough here.
Or should I say "we"
are on the cusp, my dear?
Now...
You, of all people, should have no cause to doubt this.
You understand... the relationship... between thought and electric current... how electric stimulus from an outside source charges through your brain in negative and positive charges, forcing through the synapses of your brain.
Yes... you understand very well, my dear.
Are you ready, Ardelia?
Now... let us see whether or not I am right.
I am told Dr. Barnard is holding a new inmate.
Or should I say "patient"?
Yes, Dr. Wardlow.
They're in examination room one.
Would you care for me to get them?
That shouldn't be necessary.
I can see that it might be some trouble for you to unlodge yourself from your desk.
So we'll feel free to make ourselves at home.
Damn it!
More interruptions.
We... are far... from finished, my sweet.
Edward.
He was the one.
Edward?
Edward who?
You wouldn't know about Edward, would you?
Edward Eischel.
A damn intern, just like me, when I first came here.
But he was much more than that.
Thank you you for joining us, Mr. Eischel.
You see, if Joe Slaader was the first sign of the Apocalypse, why, then Edward Eischel was the anti-Christ.
Dr. Fenton will be arriving shortly.
Until then, I'll stay as physician in this interrogation.
Very well.
Let us begin with age.
Judging from the thinness of his hair and the decayed condition of his teeth,
I would record him as a man of about 40.
Remove the dressing.
The condition of his facial countenance is poor, suggesting that he would fit into the mongoloid classification.
His skin is rough and calloused, to the equivalence of leather, and he has numerous chromosomal abnormalities.
These are classic signs of those people indigenous to the uncivilized region of the Catskill Mountains.
Put simply, the subject is the product of gratuitous inbreeding.
I should've hoped for a more suitable asylum for such a specimen.
He has a 3-inch bulge protruding from his right shoulder blade.
This is a bizarre deformity.
It has a familiar shape.
A face, perhaps.
Fetal twins, unsegregated at birth.
I can hardly wait to get to the vivisection.
Wardlow, was at the height of his powers that night, intoxicated by his position of authority.
Well.
Now that the initial exam is completed, you've done all that is necessary...
I would like to complete my examination, Doctor!
But Dr. Fenton is not...
Do not supposed that you are in control of these proceedings.
And do not begin to think that you have jurisdiction here.
I am the superior alienist in this room, in this county!
You do remember that, don't you?
I just want...
Dr. Barnard!
We are the link between the civilized world and this society.
We are both doctor and deputy.
We are both judge and jury.
So do not presume that you rise to our level, sir.
You speak when called upon.
You are merely the custodians of one of the many spheres of my influence.
I am in control now, sir!
Harness the patient!
Do you know what per diem etrium means, Doctor?
No.
I don't suppose you do.
It means to extract vicariously.
Allow me to communicate with the patient.
Joe.
Joe!
Can you communicate?
Of course you can't communicate.
It is like your kind not to communicate in a decent and civilized manner.
I'm going to help you, Joe.
Or should I say my methods are going to help you and help us decide if you are beyond repair.
Slop.
Slop.
Slop.
Douche.
Slop... douche.
That was unintelligible, Joe.
That was ignorant talk.
I want you to talk civilized so that we may learn what happened up on your mountain.
Tell us in clear language.
I go to drink.
I can smell ovens.
I sleep.
I wake with bad things.
Very well.
Let me apply the leeches.
We will bleed the insanity out of you, Joe.
I go to drink.
I... kiss my lovin's.
This will make you talk.
I sleep.
I...
I wake with bad things.
I wake with bad things.
All right, Joe.
Let's see if we can extract that little deformity from your back.
Perhaps your little tag-along is the source of your depravity.
Fool!
That will only make things worse!
Mr. Eischel!
I think I might extract that tongue of yours whilst I'm draining this inbred's backside.
Your lack of respect...
Dr. Wardlow,
I would have thought that you would have exhausted all of your procedures by now.
Actually, Dr. Fenton, I had just about, when this upstart intern of yours decided to assault us with his own unsolicited opinion.
Very well.
If you will excuse yourselves.
By my authority, we need to prep the patient.
I am nearly complete with the subject.
Well, you will have to finish at another time, sir.
There is no other time.
Spare me your ridiculous...
I simply do not want to breach the jurisdiction and have to report mishandling on a prime suspect!
It is in the law that anyone...
Sleep!
I know the law.
I all but wrote the law, you foolish old man!
Dr. Fenton, let us speak on this matter tomorrow.
I wouldn't want to waste a perfectly good shot, now, would I?
A little harmless laughing serum never hurts, does it, friend?
As for the needle... that is another matter.
Let Dr. Fenton clean that up.
So Edward was charged with looking after Joe.
Is that right, Dr. Jarvis?
Edward charged himself with that duty.
And on that first night, the full machinations of his warped mind began to twist and turn.
The connections between Joe's two identities that Wardlow only narrowly understood were becoming clearer and clearer to Edward.
Time is of the utmost importance, my friend.
You must not die now.
At least not until
I get acquainted with your friend.
How can you talk like that?
Who are you?
How can you speak like this?
Speak to me again!
Kiss my lovin's.
Speak to me like you just spoke to me, damn it.
I wake with bad things.
A connection was obvious between the feeble mind in Joe's head and the potentially brilliant mind in his back!
Now, who do you suppose is gonna have to clean this up?
You.
Doctor!
I cut 'em off!
I...
I really did it this time.
I cut those little bastards...
Yeah!
Yeah!
Easy, Doc.
He ain't lying'.
I don't mind.
So, there's enough for the both of us.
Shoulda seen me.
I got the scissors.
Boys, I gotta go.
Okay?
Not today.
Wait!
Don't you wanna know why?
Yeah, ask him.
It's real good, Eddie.
Jasper, why don't you spare me the suspense and just tell me.
Jasper, come here.
Jasper, no.
What is it?
Come here.
Hey!
Damn it, you fool!
No!
Piece by piece by piece by piece.
Just like Jason and the Golden Fleece.
For now, I just suggest that we can... understand the character of someone... the nature of their brain by merely analyzing the shape of their skull, their bumps and divots.
What, I wonder, would those hacks make of your second mind?
How do you analyze a man who holds half the power of his mind in the curvature of his spine?
You can finally sleep now, my friend, just like you hoped, into your dreams.
I wonder what happens there, in that mind, in those minds.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep...
Wake up, Joe.
J.
I kiss my lovin'.
Now, baby girl!
Now.
Wake up, Joe.
Wake up, Joe.
Wake up, Joe.

Amducious.
Joe!
Joe!
Move!
Speak!
Move!
Gruntle, damn it!
Move!
Curious.
I have the only key.
It's the only way out.
There's much more to this.
Much, much more.
Curious.
Curious.
I see you've come down to help with the disposal.
Disposal of what?
Jasper Crown was viciously murdered last night.
Interesting.
"Interesting" is hardly the term for such a mutilation.
His skin was ripped off of his bones.
Pieces of him were found all over his cell.
The blood was everywhere.
Maybe you shouldn't work here, then.
What was that?
I said what a terrible sin.
Yes.
I would agree.
Is Joe Slaader prepped for Dr. Fenton's exam?
He is.
He's still unconscious, so an eye-level physical exam is all that we'll be able to obtain.
That'll be well enough.
Now... go assist with the clean-up.
We don't want those heinous vipers comin' up with me.
Moron.
And to think the mutant care of these people are in his hands.
Most men would've been turned away by this bloodshed.
The confusion and horror of it would've stopped them in their tracks, but Edward...
Edward, he was different.
What made Barnard and everyone else shiver excited him beyond belief... and provided the momentum to his work and his ideas.
Good morning, sweetheart.
The good doctor is in.
I had a most astounding evening last night.
The most astonishing patient was admitted here, and I have only been allowed a limited time to experiment with him.
And, well... my work has hit a bit of a bump already.
Or shall I say a bridge, a bridge to link the human mind to the one thing it's always sought.
Call it what you will...
telepathy, ESP, astral projections, or simply put, the ability to unshackle the brain from unnecessary hindrances.
The very things, Ardelia, the very same things that you and I have been talking about.
This work that I'm doin' with you... it's clear to me.
It's... it's as if I were destined...
No.
Not scientific.
Indeed... the work that you and I have been doing here will definitely open up the possibilities of Joe Slaader even more to me.
Through my work, the world can be given a new set of eyes, breathe new air, speak a million times clearer.
Through us, Ardelia, whole worlds can be created.
But... to transcend... first we must begin with a more, shall we say, basic pursuit before reaching the greater summit.
I knew you would agree, my sweet.
That is correct.
That is the pleasure point of your brain.
Are you ready, Ardelia?
Are you ready to take tele-human electricity to the limit?
Let us begin apace.
Let us see whether or not we can harness the world of thought.
Move your body.
Very interesting.
Involuntary reflex.
Something seems a bit fuzzy.
Tell me something, Ardelia... something I'd like to hear.
Tell me that you love me.
I...
Speak clearly, Ardelia.
Do you feel that, honey?
Do your loins ache for my snapped impulses?
Tell me that I'm your guy.
Give me more.
I want to hear you, Ardelia.
Yes, that is correct.
More!
The brain is the core of all things... pleasurable and painful.
More!
Now we shall incite the pleasure.
I want you to feel me, feel my strength.
More!
Yes.
Yes!
Now you can feel true sensations in the rawest form!
Yes.
Very interesting.
You've changed in a certain way.
Progressed, maybe.
Impossible.
Yet the evidence of your emotional increase is still apparent.
More.
Just like a woman to beg for more.
"More.
More."
More...
No more, my sweet.
We wouldn't want to overdo it, now, would we?
You have no idea how powerful a man like myself can be.
It's 12:00.
Fenton.
Damn it.
More.
Sorry I'm late.
I apologize, Dr. Fenton.
I didn't realize you were in another meeting.
I'll return shortly.
No, no, Mr. Eischel!
These men are here for you.
I, of course, oppose their intrusion on our daily meeting, but they insisted.
That will be quite enough, Dr. Fenton.
Excuse me, Dr. Wardlow, am I to understand that I'm in some kind of trouble?
A simple reprimand is all that should be necessary this morning.
We have quite a lot on our slate, given the latest mutilation, so we can't be bothered too much with this.
I don't...
But your outburst yesterday evening was inexcusable, not to mention highly unprofessional.
If you aspire to a position of any significance in this institution, then you will heed my words with great caution.
When we have a man... strike that... a monster in our custody, it is necessary for us to break him, shatter his will.
Our methods are highly regarded at facilities of much greater import than this tomb, and you would do well not to question them,
Mr. Eischel.
I cannot abide some namby-pamby intern questioning my authority whilst I am working.
Such an act is detestable to me, sir.
More so than the acts of that inbred cornpoke we were admitting.
Am I allowed to retort?
Edward, please.
I should think that your reaction would be one of relief that we have not extinguished your career here, sir.
And I should think that a man of such reputable education and experience would recognize the pure gem of an unfettered and remarkable intellect when he holds it in his own hands, instead of resorting to such base and uninformed tactics as leeches.
I thought you to be a doctor, sir, not a snake oil salesman.
Edward!
That's quite all right, Dr. Fenton.
You don't have to feign anger on my account.
I realize you detest me as much as this worm here.
I may be a man of great dignity and respect in this community, a man of tremendous learning and honor, but don't presume for one second, that I am above fucking you like a low-rent whore.
With a moment's notice, I can crush your balls in my hand, and toss you aside to the gutter, never to be heard from again.
Don't you forget that, you insolent bastard!
Good day, sir.
Dr. Fenton, I think that we should discuss Jasper.
Leave.
Shouldn't we have our meeting now?
Leave, Eischel!
Well, at least that's finished.
What is this?
Hello, Uncle.
Has anyone seen this?
We have a dead patient, with a syringe in his head.
Welcome, Uncle Irving.
This is unexpected.
My boy, have you seen this mess by the front door?
I should figure.
I come to visit my nephew... what do I find?
Edward, there is a dead body on the floor.
What in heaven's name is going on in this place?
How long has that corpse been there?
Aren't there interns responsible for cleaning up such things?
To what do I owe the honor of this visit, Uncle?
"To what do I owe the honor..."
Should you have to even ask?
Is it unusual for your sole benefactor to want to see where you work, and what kind of work they have you doing?
It is truly not a good time now, Uncle.
The asylum has been under a lot of pressure.
Is that Dr. Wardlow?
Edward, you've been much too modest about this place.
It must be very important to employ an alien.
Hardly.
Good day, sir.
Wait, Dr. Wardlow.
You may not remember me.
I met you at the Governor's mansion several years ago.
I am Dr. Irving...
Uncle!
I do not think these men have time to chat with us.
Let us be on our way.
Hardly the truth, Edward.
We have all the time we need.
What is your practice, Doctor?
I am a family doctor.
But I've been conducting interesting experiments for the last few years.
I've just achieved a breakthrough in fungus.
Uncle, now is not the time!
Edward, hush.
I hold alienists in the very highest regard, as should you.
Well, Doctor,
I hold family doctors in a special place as well.
Without your practices, we alienists wouldn't have time to do the work we do, the important work.
Have a wonderful visit.
Not the right time, indeed, huh?
You ungrateful nephew.
I get you into a good school despite your questionable merits.
I pay your tuition, every damn cent, and you try to brush me off.
Your parents never would've...
Enough!
You took my happy home!
My happy home!
And your work...
I want to see where my money's gone.
They killed Brother Don!
He's dead, I tell you.
He's dead!
If you come, he'll die.
He'll be perfect.
He had no pricklies!
If you come, he'll die!
God!
She's saying to me,
"Piece by piece by piece."
Oh, please.
He was so fucking nice.
Oh, God.
Piece by piece.
Piece by piece.
Piece by piece by piece by piece by the golden fleece.
She's saying to me!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Now there is a man for solitary.
No wonder you look so tattered, Edward.
This place is as sloppy as a pig's trough.
Show me more.
I want to see your work.
You know, in my day, these mental delinquents were not a problem.
We just hung 'em.
One noose and poof!
Since when did they put interns in the basement?
Do all the interns work down here?
Do you have anything to drink?
I'm parched.
You nearly walked me to death.
What was all that commotion, and why couldn't I walk in all the corridors?
I tell you, this place is a miserable excuse for an asylum.
If I ran this place, I'd...
Dear God!
What is this?
This is my research, years of development.
Development of what?
Why would you have need of this?
Sorted mamalian brains.
It's deep, Uncle.
These took seven hours to extract from one patient.
It was very difficult.
Ah, she's dead!
She's not dead, Uncle.
She's far from it.
You just haven't said anything to her.
Are you trying to be humorous?
Come now, Uncle.
Say something.
You're upsetting her, I can tell.
Uh, hello?
What's her name?
Ardelia.
Hello, Ardelia.
She's alive!
Of course she's alive!
I... more...
What?
I... love...
What do you love?
More... more... faster...
Fascinating.
Dear God in heaven!
You are keeping a cadaver as a kind of a sex toy?
This is worse than I could have imagined.
It's unholy!
You're a bastard to the profession!
You're tampering with mortality!
I've done nothing of the sort.
You have, Edward, you have.
You will be damned!
I have harnessed the electric current of the brain, commanding it at my will with the flip of a switch.
Look at you!
You are a freak!
Sitting in your lab performing sexual experiments, while the real doctors move above you, saving lives.
You're a mockery and a misfit in the field that we... that I work in.
I am a pioneer on the modern thought of brain functions.
I have the ability to manipulate...
I know all about your manipulations.
Yes, yes, I see.
I know that you could never be a nephew of mine.
No, sweet God, no!
This is an outrage!
I am more of a scientist than you will ever be!
Will you kill me and make me into a monster?
I do not create monsters.
I channel the human brain.
I can create thoughts where thoughts never existed.
I can take a vegetable mind and make it live again.
In my hands, the brain can think, where in others it's tossed aside like a wasted piece of tissue in haste.
You've brought nothing but shame upon the family.
Today, you are dead to us!
I can even monitor thought with this device here.
And if I can help it, your days down here are numbered.
Playing with minds...
What do you think you are, God Almighty?
So be it!
Let me die to my family.
It's my profession.
They're all without hope anyway, trudging about with archaic thoughts and prehistoric philosophies.
Let me die to them.
Let me die!
They can all go to hell!
Go to hell!
Joe, I want to do some tests on you.
There's certain elements in your head, that, if harnessed properly, can give me a clear image of what happens inside your mind or shall I say, "minds?"
I know the drink.
I kissed my lovins.
Sleep.
I wake with bad things.
That is as I thought you would say.
But what of the other, the other inside you?
Why does that voice only get to speak on select occasions?
I wake with bad things.
No matter.
I will bring the voice out and meet the mind of your deformed, yet brilliant fetal twin, the one that's been trapped in your body for close to 50 years.
Let us begin.
Dr. Wardlow, I didn't realize you were in the middle of...
Oh, yes.
It's a far cry from fungus, Uncle Irving.
Yes.
What do you want?
My time is precious to me and those around me.
I come to you out of concern.
You realize this.
Of course.
Of course.
This had better be important, Dr. Eischel.
Yes, it really, truly is.
You realize... the brain conducts a million functions every second, and with those, a billion electrical charges carry and relay messages to the whole body.
To harness those, to differentiate between them... would give me the opportunity to read your mind like a picture book.
There are many matters that deserve our attention.
Yes, but it's hard to...
Speak plain, sir!
Do not waste my time with an old man's muttering.
My nephew is conducting experiments.
He's tampering with the human brain through electricity.
He has a live subject in the cellar of this asylum.
The scientific approach to this.
Sleep.
Just tell me.
I must sleep.
Tell me.
Who is Amducious?
Who is Amducious?
Sleep.
Who is Amducious?
Is that all?
A child tampering with his pet.
He... mentioned a new arrival.
Joe Slaader.
Yes, yes.
That's the one.
He intends to test his theories on him.
Why is his name written in blood on our walls?
Is he the man within you?
Speak to me!
What?
On my patient?
Impossible!
It's true.
The audacity!
That's it.
Speak!
More, Joe, more!
Am... duci...
More!
More!
More!
Am... du... ci...
No!
No, this can't be!
I'm so close!
You don't need to harness my voice.
I can speak just fine on my own.
What?
I would think by now that you would have overcome these eccentric outbursts at my arrival.
I am, after all, part of Joe.
So you are his fetal twin!
You are the second mind.
Such a simple mind.
You have not yet searched all your possibilities.
You have not yet delved into the deepest, darkest canyon to find me yet, have you?
You were the protrusion on his back!
You have to be!
Through a maze of synaptic impulses, the two beings have fused into one.
Joe is the involuntary being and you are his voluntary counterpart, the one actually in control.
You still are not listening.
Think, think of all the possibilities.
Then you will find...
Just tell me this.
Tell me, who is Amducious?
I am Amducious.
When you call my name, know this:
You call upon me, Amducious, master and ruler of Joe Slaader.
He is but a host.
Host?
I... am...
Amducious.
Joe will sleep now.
Wait!
Why sleep?
What is in sleep?
In sleep, Edward, is freedom.
When we dream, life becomes a world ready to serve.
All you have to do is desire.
My Bonnie lies over
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over
Lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over
Bonnie lies over
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the sea
Dear Christ.
Amducious?
Too much to clean up this time, Joe.
Too much to hide.
Damn it, Joe!
Why?
I don't think this patient will be any of your concern any longer, Edward Eischel.
Men, bind up the monster.
This... this...
He... he...
He can... it can be explained.
You miserable fool.
There is no explanation.
Your friend is a monster, and monsters must be annihilated for the good of the people.
No!
No!
Amducious!
Amducious!
Mr. Eischel, there's someone here to see you.
Dr. Fenton,
I will take responsibility for my nephew.
I will help clear him completely out of this facility.
Edward, it's not that we are holding you culpable in any way in this matter.
It's just that you're too close to this now, too involved.
It looks more suspect than it probably is, but we can't take any chances.
If we anger the community, we could be shut down.
You have to go, Edward.
There is no question.
Even if I tried to keep you here,
Dr. Wardlow and his jackals would be rid of you in no time.
Of course we understand, sir.
We're all, well, you and I both are doctors.
We both took an oath to care for the sick.
Yes, of course.
Thank you for your help in this matter, sir.
Edward, good luck in your pursuits.
Try to learn from this.
Dr. Fenton?
Yes, Edward?
What is to happen to Joe?
Execution seems to be the only option we have left.
Well, good day, gentlemen.
Edward.
Sleep!
You must to sleep.
I can't, Daddy.
I can't.
# Mama had a baby and its head popped off. #
# Mama had a baby and its head popped off. #
Edward.
Come on, Edward.
Come down here.
Down here, Edward.
We're down here.
Hello, my beloved.
You are long past due.
Quiet!
Quiet or I'll tell.
Let me show you how we came about, how our people came to your world.
It is in the word in the text, which you already know about, which you've been reading since the moment you met Daddy.
Enter into your mind's eye, Edward, and see.
Our great, great grandparents came across the stretch of water.
It was they that brought the truth.
It was they that brought the idea of really seeing what is already in all of us.
Through their rituals, they claimed their right.
And through the years, they bred one with the other, brother with sister, again and again to bring forth the perfect vessel for Amducious.
We all were once a great and powerful people, part of a secret society that God created.
We were the leaders of the whole world... but something bad happened, Edward, something terrible that we must never speak of.
Never.
That's why you will come to us through Daddy.
That's why Daddy is with you, so that you can help release Amducious and we can be the chosen people again.
My brains!
My brains!
You monsters!
They were perfect specimens.
They were my brains!
My work!
Nurse Calloway...
I-I suppose you know.
That you're not supposed to be here?
Yes.
Is there any way I can ask you not...
Not to say anything to anybody?
Yes.
Is that possible?
You know I've always found you to be a very kind person.
Never harboring malice towards anyone.
Well...
Of course, Dr. Eischel.
I can do that for you.
Please, dear, call me Edward.
Nurse Calloway.
Yes, Edward?
Joe Slaader, is he still being kept here?
Until tomorrow.
Dr. Wardlow's doing surgery on him.
I'm preparing the operating room.
He actually asked me to get more gauze.
Expecting a lot of blood, is he?
I suppose.
Dr. Wardlow,
I was not told that you would be working here tonight, especially not this late.
Is that Joe Slaader in the operating room?
Dr. Fenton, I really don't have time for another go-around with you.
Whether you approve of my presence or not in your dreadful facility is of no consequence to me.
No consequence!
I am the director of this facility.
What goes on inside its walls is of the greatest consequence to me.
And I am getting tired of the way that you treat me and the good people that work under me.
Yes, Dr. Fenton, it's true.
Dr. Fenton, you are the director of this facility.
Yes.
Yes.
The director.
Right.
And as director this facility has been the scene of not one but two heinous mutilations.
And to add to it, it has been revealed that one of these so-called good people that work here has used his position to facilitate his own bizarre and unholy sex acts.
Well, that can't be...
Let's not play this game anymore.
I'm tired of it, tired of the pretense, the official dialogue that has run its course twice over by now.
Let us just say what is in our hearts.
You are a fucking imbecile!
The idiot captain of a sinking vessel, a rat's ship that is better served as kindling.
The people under you are mere scabs, better to be picked and tossed aside than to be harbored and looked after.
Tell me, Dr. Fenton, are there even balls to cut here?
This is highly unprofessional.
That's true, Dr. Fenton.
Let's make this professional, shall we?
This facility is no longer under your care.
It's a crime scene, host to the two worst blood baths this county has ever seen.
By order of the court, I, as superior alienist, am taking charge of this facility until further notice.
How's that for professional, you useless fuck?
Now, get the hell out of my sight before I unofficially cut off your scrotum and force-feed it to you!
Bring in the patient!
Bring him to me!
This is mine.
This is all mine!
Mine!
This is my asylum.
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
You think this is wrong?
No!
And you know why?
Because I run this place, and nobody can take it from me.
Nobody!
Get out of the way!
Move!
Move!
Damn it!
This is mine!
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
We're takin' the intern's belongings to the dump.
How much of it still remains?
Just the junction box and some wire and...
Yes, yes.
Don't be afraid of me, boys.
Mental patient, sir.
She was experimented on.
Now all she does is mumbles and drools.
Yes, I've heard of her.
Very well.
You may go now.
Do no further work until tomorrow.
Do you understand me?
Right.
This shall be a treat.
Hello, my little lambkin.
Oh, a vegetable.
So this is Eischel's bitch.
Another one that has fallen out of Wardlow's control.
And what would Wardlow do with you,
I wonder.
Oh, come, my lovekin.
We dance the night away.
But how could he schtump her?
Or do such...
But he is a fool.
It is impossible!
What is that commotion?
They, they say he awakened right before they, they brought him in, and they pumped him with another vial of sleepers.
Impossible.
I prepped him with enough sleepers to knock him out for the winter.
Pull back the sheet.
I want to look at him.
What is this?
Yes, I can see why you appealed so much to the young intern.
But I am certain you have yet to feel a real man.
We need a safe place to go.
How can this be?
How can I be surrounded by such imbeciles?
Perhaps a visual is needed to stun you morons into comprehension.
Out of my way.
Move!
Out of the way!
Move!
Joe.
Joe!
I'm looking for you, Joe!
Come out!
I want to help you with that fester on your back!
Where is he?
Joe.
I don't have a lot of time.
So I'm gonna have to explain as I proceed.
I've been to your village.
Did you hear me?
Have you any idea that I'm even here?
Sleepers.
It's simple, really.
The drill bit, breaks through your scalp and funnels a hole an inch deep.
And then, this dips into your skull... and lifts out your bone fragment.
Simple.
You see, if Amducious won't come to me, then I will come to Amducious.
I know who you are, Joe.
That's right.
They've been waiting for you for many years.
I understand this now.
Don't worry.
The blood will stop.
Letting your brain breathe for the first time.
The brain needs air.
Releases the pressure.
It gives us more power.
Barnard!
Dr. Wardlow.
Good.
Where's Dr. Fenton?
Ah, Barnard.
Perfect timing.
It is time, Amducious.
It is time for you and I to become one.
Come with me.
Come see what real science is.
You're covered in blood!
For you to reveal the hidden mysteries of the universe to me.
I want to feel the power of the ages.
Of course I am, Barnard!
Of course.
Please!
Shut up!
Or I won't tell you, silly.

The bridge between the dream realm of the mind and the real world of the flesh.
Come, Amducious!
I was born for this day.
For Amducious!

Come to me, my love.
Let us serve our one true master, our one and only God.
Dr. Fenton.
It is now I who am all powerful and you who are powerless!
You shall now serve me!
Daddy.
Daddy.
No, wait.
You shall now serve Amducious.
Eischel!
At last your madness is revealed.
It is just as I expected.
What do you know from madness, Dr. Wardlow?
I am the only judge of that now.
And soon you will understand all too well.
Ah.
The little Missis.
That's quite a head wound you have there, my dear.
But, Edward, I must say, an excellent specimen.
Do not mock what we have done here.
All your power is now gone, and you will finally see true power.
This is what you would have ruined had you had your way with Joe, destroying that ultimate power that resides in his back.
You imbecile!
You fool!
Make him bow before me, my dear, for soon he will not have a head to bow before my master.
Look around you at these nine heads, all connected.
Their brains linked through one strong unbreakable current, linked to this vessel that carries my master that will soon be linked to me.
As you can see, one pole is vacant.
One more brain is necessary for the full power of Amducious to be released.
This is not science, Edward!
This is madness!
What you've set up is only an altar to yourself and to your own insanity!
You know nothing of control, Edward.
I have controlled this place up until now.
You see, you have only let this place have control over you!
This will ruin you!
Listen to me, Edward!
You cannot do this to my asylum!
You might still have a chance at this place if you just let me go.
I order you, Eischel.
Let me go!
Let you go?
Are you blind?
What more do you need to see to recognize the true authority here?
Well, now the rest shall be revealed.
You see?
I am the messenger of Amducious!
Amducious!
Amducious!
Amducious!
Be my messenger bringing the wrath of the Grand Duke of Hades upon them all.
For now, you must realize that the only thing more powerful than the mind is me.
Bring me forth, Edward.
Bring me the simple dreams of men's minds and shepherd me into true reality.
I want to feel the mind of my victim.
And now for your part, sir.
You shall be the final connection between my master and I.
Through your foolish gray matter, the power of my lord will pass through to me and be free from the prison of the dream world!
Free to walk the earth.
Freedom.
Freedom.
Daddy's free.
Amducious, no!
No, it can't be!
It can't be.
Please!
No!
Your work here is finished!
Amducious.
Yes.
Sleep.
# Mama had a baby, # # and its head popped off. #
# Mama had a baby, # # and its head popped off. #
Daddy.
Daddy.
Sleep.
Listen.
Go to sleep.
Dr. Barnard.
Yes?
Um, I'm new on this floor, and, well, I was sort of curious about this man.
Curious.
Really.
I wouldn't worry about him.
Well, I was particularly interested in his drug regimen.
Seems that he's on a great deal of stimulants.
Quite an excessive amount, actually.
Yes.
An extremely excessive amount, and I'd like to keep it that way.
But, sir, I don't understand.
His name is Edward Eischel, and he's been awake for two years straight.
Don't ever let him fall asleep, young man, at all cost.
He must never sleep.
Had I known who I had been put in charge of that day, had I known all the dreadful truth,
I can't say I would've stayed here.
Dr. Barnard had established a new order in the asylum, it's true.
But there was still much darkness in this place, more than Barnard, myself, or anyone else could've swept away and covered up with some new white paint.
No, the world, we like to think lies safely beyond the walls of sleep and in some other plane of existence had slipped ever so briefly into this one.
A man can endure many things, more than most of us like to think he can.
He can live without food and water for months.
He can live through the most ravaging disease, brave the harshest of elements, and live without almost anything most of us would consider a necessity.
But the one thing he can't live without, no matter how hard he tries is sleep.
All right.
All right, then, Mr. Jarvis, let's get underway with the interview here, okay?
Uh, we'll be taping this.
It was... the most dangerous time.
Wild time.
Unpredictable.
As fierce as the Windego... yet with the curiosity of a wildcat.
Thirsty for blood.
It was the greatest of my many theories.
Yet it resembled my greatest success.
Yeah.
Right.
If you don't mind, we're gonna begin.
Okay?
Let's just start simply, okay?
It shows here in the first official recording of this asylum, that would be January 1911, that you were an intern working under doctor...
Actually, we don't have that.
Do we have the date correct, Mr. Jarvis?
His eyes, his hands.
How could we have known?
Mr. Jarvis, is the date correct?
Is the date correct?
Do not rush me, you cunt!
I have to tell you, the beginnings of this asylum is to root way back into dark, forgotten seasons back when the primordial ooze still boiled at the dawn of time.
Its history is darker than the Middle Ages, my friend, darker than the bottom tier of hell.
You see... this asylum wasn't built in a day, nor did it get the way it is now because of its founders.
The asylum was built on fear, fear of the unknown, its darkest origins speaking in the mind of an inbred named Joe Slaader of the Catskill Mountains.
Sleep.
Sleep now, baby girl.
I can't, Daddy, I can't.
You must to sleep!
None live with no sleep.
We sleep, Amducious come and make us free.
Sleep!
Sleep, sleep, sleep!
Sleep!
In him, we gave meaning to what we did here.
In him, we justified our places here, justified... our dirtiest deeds.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time is over now.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time's over.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time's over now.
Wake up, Joe.
Sleep time is over now.
I have blood!
Follow the blood!
Must be dead!
No!
No!
No kill!
Find Joe, then ask Amducious!
Well, well, well.
Seems someone's already formed a posse.
Hello, boys.
Must be something really important goin' on here for you guys to be away from your homes.
Mighty important for you to stop fuckin' your sisters for more 'n a minute.
- We find blood.
- You find blood, do you?
Well, no shit.
We found gallons of it in your cabin down yonder.
We have a missing inbred, a missing head, and now I got a posse of you searchin' for the same thing we are.
You want to explain that, you stupid son of a bitch?
You make me sick.
My stomach turns at the sight of you.
We're takin over this search.
If you want to dispute that, we'll just arrest you for incest, bigamy, huh?
Conspiracy?
Just for general fuckin' ugliness.
We go back.
No!
You are comin' with us.
No!
We no abide!
You will abide, and you will come with us!
There's three dead, one missing...
one of your own.
And that's enough for us to turn your campsite upside down.
Sir!
What?
Dear God...
Sweet Jesus.
You go into town today, Joe?
I guess we'll know that I sleep.
You be careful.
Don't say bad things.
You sleep.
Oh, I hate the bad things.
I hate the bad things.
You see, my dear, I've always believed that human thought is the product of atomic or molecular motion.
And that motion can be converted into... to ether waves, like heat, light, electricity.
It's much like my device here.
With the energy from the muscle tissue in my arm transferred to the crank, to the fuses, to the wires...
I am able to harness electricity itself.
And what I propose is that, we can harness human thought in the exact same way.
Given the most recent developments in electro-shock therapy,
I think it's obvious that science is on the cusp of a major breakthrough here.
Or should I say "we"
are on the cusp, my dear?
Now...
You, of all people, should have no cause to doubt this.
You understand... the relationship... between thought and electric current... how electric stimulus from an outside source charges through your brain in negative and positive charges, forcing through the synapses of your brain.
Yes... you understand very well, my dear.
Are you ready, Ardelia?
Now... let us see whether or not I am right.
I am told Dr. Barnard is holding a new inmate.
Or should I say "patient"?
Yes, Dr. Wardlow.
They're in examination room one.
- Would you care for me to get them?
- That shouldn't be necessary.
I can see that it might be some trouble for you to unlodge yourself from your desk.
So we'll feel free to make ourselves at home.
Damn it!
More interruptions.
We... are far... from finished, my sweet.
Edward.
He was the one.
Edward?
Edward who?
You wouldn't know about Edward, would you?
Edward Eischel.
A damn intern, just like me, when I first came here.
But he was much more than that.
Thank you you for joining us, Mr. Eischel.
You see, if Joe Slaader was the first sign of the Apocalypse, why, then Edward Eischel was the anti-Christ.
Dr. Fenton will be arriving shortly.
Until then, I'll stay as physician in this interrogation.
Very well.
Let us begin with age.
Judging from the thinness of his hair and the decayed condition of his teeth,
I would record him as a man of about 40.
Remove the dressing.
The condition of his facial countenance is poor, suggesting that he would fit into the mongoloid classification.
His skin is rough and calloused, to the equivalence of leather, and he has numerous chromosomal abnormalities.
These are classic signs of those people indigenous to the uncivilized region of the Catskill Mountains.
Put simply, the subject is the product of gratuitous inbreeding.
I should've hoped for a more suitable asylum for such a specimen.
He has a 3-inch bulge protruding from his right shoulder blade.
This is a bizarre deformity.
It has a familiar shape.
A face, perhaps.
Fetal twins, unsegregated at birth.
I can hardly wait to get to the vivisection.
Wardlow, was at the height of his powers that night, intoxicated by his position of authority.
Well.
Now that the initial exam is completed, you've done all that is necessary...
I would like to complete my examination, Doctor!
But Dr. Fenton is not...
Do not supposed that you are in control of these proceedings.
And do not begin to think that you have jurisdiction here.
I am the superior alienist in this room, in this county!
You do remember that, don't you?
- I just want...
- Dr. Barnard!
We are the link between the civilized world and this society.
We are both doctor and deputy.
We are both judge and jury.
So do not presume that you rise to our level, sir.
You speak when called upon.
You are merely the custodians of one of the many spheres of my influence.
I am in control now, sir!
Harness the patient!
Do you know what per diem etrium means, Doctor?
No.
I don't suppose you do.
It means to extract vicariously.
Allow me to communicate with the patient.
Joe.
Joe!
Can you communicate?
Of course you can't communicate.
It is like your kind not to communicate in a decent and civilized manner.
I'm going to help you, Joe.
Or should I say my methods are going to help you and help us decide if you are beyond repair.
Slop.
Slop.
Slop.
Douche.
Slop... douche.
That was unintelligible, Joe.
That was ignorant talk.
I want you to talk civilized so that we may learn what happened up on your mountain.
Tell us in clear language.
I go to drink.
I can smell ovens.
I sleep.
I wake with bad things.
Very well.
Let me apply the leeches.
We will bleed the insanity out of you, Joe.
I go to drink.
I... kiss my lovin's.
- This will make you talk.
- I sleep.
I...
I wake with bad things.
I wake with bad things.
All right, Joe.
Let's see if we can extract that little deformity from your back.
Perhaps your little tag-along is the source of your depravity.
Fool!
That will only make things worse!
Mr. Eischel!
I think I might extract that tongue of yours whilst I'm draining this inbred's backside.
- Your lack of respect...
- Dr. Wardlow,
I would have thought that you would have exhausted all of your procedures by now.
Actually, Dr. Fenton, I had just about, when this upstart intern of yours decided to assault us with his own unsolicited opinion.
Very well.
If you will excuse yourselves.
By my authority, we need to prep the patient.
I am nearly complete with the subject.
Well, you will have to finish at another time, sir.
There is no other time.
Spare me your ridiculous...
I simply do not want to breach the jurisdiction and have to report mishandling on a prime suspect!
It is in the law that anyone...
Sleep!
I know the law.
I all but wrote the law, you foolish old man!
Dr. Fenton, let us speak on this matter tomorrow.
I wouldn't want to waste a perfectly good shot, now, would I?
A little harmless laughing serum never hurts, does it, friend?
As for the needle... that is another matter.
Let Dr. Fenton clean that up.
So Edward was charged with looking after Joe.
Is that right, Dr. Jarvis?
Edward charged himself with that duty.
And on that first night, the full machinations of his warped mind began to twist and turn.
The connections between Joe's two identities that Wardlow only narrowly understood were becoming clearer and clearer to Edward.
Time is of the utmost importance, my friend.
You must not die now.
At least not until
I get acquainted with your friend.
How can you talk like that?
Who are you?
How can you speak like this?
- Speak to me again!
- Kiss my lovin's.
Speak to me like you just spoke to me, damn it.
I wake with bad things.
A connection was obvious between the feeble mind in Joe's head and the potentially brilliant mind in his back!
Now, who do you suppose is gonna have to clean this up?
You.
Doctor!
I cut 'em off!
I...
I really did it this time.
I cut those little bastards...
Yeah!
Yeah!
Easy, Doc.
He ain't lying'.
I don't mind.
So, there's enough for the both of us.
Shoulda seen me.
I got the scissors.
Boys, I gotta go.
Okay?
Not today.
Wait!
Don't you wanna know why?
Yeah, ask him.
It's real good, Eddie.
Jasper, why don't you spare me the suspense and just tell me.
Jasper, come here.
Jasper, no.
What is it?
Come here.
Hey!
Damn it, you fool!
No!
Piece by piece by piece by piece.
Just like Jason and the Golden Fleece.
For now, I just suggest that we can... understand the character of someone... the nature of their brain by merely analyzing the shape of their skull, their bumps and divots.
What, I wonder, would those hacks make of your second mind?
How do you analyze a man who holds half the power of his mind in the curvature of his spine?
You can finally sleep now, my friend, just like you hoped, into your dreams.
I wonder what happens there, in that mind, in those minds.
- Wake up, Joe.
- Sleep...
Wake up, Joe.
J.
I kiss my lovin'.
Now, baby girl!
Now.
- Wake up, Joe.
- Wake up, Joe.
Wake up, Joe.
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by Piece!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
- Piece by piece!
- Hi, Joe.
By piece!
Wake up, Joel
Amducious.
Joe!
Joe!
Move!
Speak!
Move!
Gruntle, damn it!
Move!
Curious.
I have the only key.
It's the only way out.
There's much more to this.
Much, much more.
Curious.
Curious.
I see you've come down to help with the disposal.
Disposal of what?
Jasper Crown was viciously murdered last night.
Interesting.
"Interesting" is hardly the term for such a mutilation.
His skin was ripped off of his bones.
Pieces of him were found all over his cell.
The blood was everywhere.
Maybe you shouldn't work here, then.
What was that?
I said what a terrible sin.
Yes.
I would agree.
Is Joe Slaader prepped for Dr. Fenton's exam?
He is.
He's still unconscious, so an eye-level physical exam is all that we'll be able to obtain.
That'll be well enough.
Now... go assist with the clean-up.
We don't want those heinous vipers comin' up with me.
Moron.
And to think the mutant care of these people are in his hands.
Most men would've been turned away by this bloodshed.
The confusion and horror of it would've stopped them in their tracks, but Edward...
Edward, he was different.
What made Barnard and everyone else shiver excited him beyond belief... and provided the momentum to his work and his ideas.
Good morning, sweetheart.
The good doctor is in.
I had a most astounding evening last night.
The most astonishing patient was admitted here, and I have only been allowed a limited time to experiment with him.
And, well... my work has hit a bit of a bump already.
Or shall I say a bridge, a bridge to link the human mind to the one thing it's always sought.
Call it what you will...
telepathy, ESP, astral projections, or simply put, the ability to unshackle the brain from unnecessary hindrances.
The very things, Ardelia, the very same things that you and I have been talking about.
This work that I'm doin' with you... it's clear to me.
It's... it's as if I were destined...
No.
Not scientific.
Indeed... the work that you and I have been doing here will definitely open up the possibilities of Joe Slaader even more to me.
Through my work, the world can be given a new set of eyes, breathe new air, speak a million times clearer.
Through us, Ardelia, whole worlds can be created.
But... to transcend... first we must begin with a more, shall we say, basic pursuit before reaching the greater summit.
I knew you would agree, my sweet.
That is correct.
That is the pleasure point of your brain.
Are you ready, Ardelia?
Are you ready to take tele-human electricity to the limit?
Let us begin apace.
Let us see whether or not we can harness the world of thought.
Move your body.
Very interesting.
Involuntary reflex.
Something seems a bit fuzzy.
Tell me something, Ardelia... something I'd like to hear.
Tell me that you love me.
I...
Speak clearly, Ardelia.
Do you feel that, honey?
Do your loins ache for my snapped impulses?
Tell me that I'm your guy.
Give me more.
I want to hear you, Ardelia.
Yes, that is correct.
- More!
- The brain is the core of all things... pleasurable and painful.
- More!
- Now we shall incite the pleasure.
I want you to feel me, feel my strength.
More!
Yes.
Yes!
Now you can feel true sensations in the rawest form!
Yes.
Very interesting.
You've changed in a certain way.
Progressed, maybe.
Impossible.
Yet the evidence of your emotional increase is still apparent.
More.
Just like a woman to beg for more.
"More.
More."
More...
No more, my sweet.
We wouldn't want to overdo it, now, would we?
You have no idea how powerful a man like myself can be.
It's 12:00.
Fenton.
Damn it.
More.
Sorry I'm late.
I apologize, Dr. Fenton.
I didn't realize you were in another meeting.
- I'll return shortly.
- No, no, Mr. Eischel!
These men are here for you.
I, of course, oppose their intrusion on our daily meeting, but they insisted.
That will be quite enough, Dr. Fenton.
Excuse me, Dr. Wardlow, am I to understand that I'm in some kind of trouble?
A simple reprimand is all that should be necessary this morning.
We have quite a lot on our slate, given the latest mutilation, so we can't be bothered too much with this.
I don't...
But your outburst yesterday evening was inexcusable, not to mention highly unprofessional.
If you aspire to a position of any significance in this institution, then you will heed my words with great caution.
When we have a man... strike that... a monster in our custody, it is necessary for us to break him, shatter his will.
Our methods are highly regarded at facilities of much greater import than this tomb, and you would do well not to question them,
Mr. Eischel.
I cannot abide some namby-pamby intern questioning my authority whilst I am working.
Such an act is detestable to me, sir.
More so than the acts of that inbred cornpoke we were admitting.
- Am I allowed to retort?
- Edward, please.
I should think that your reaction would be one of relief that we have not extinguished your career here, sir.
And I should think that a man of such reputable education and experience would recognize the pure gem of an unfettered and remarkable intellect when he holds it in his own hands, instead of resorting to such base and uninformed tactics as leeches.
I thought you to be a doctor, sir, not a snake oil salesman.
Edward!
That's quite all right, Dr. Fenton.
You don't have to feign anger on my account.
I realize you detest me as much as this worm here.
I may be a man of great dignity and respect in this community, a man of tremendous learning and honor, but don't presume for one second, that I am above fucking you like a low-rent whore.
With a moment's notice, I can crush your balls in my hand, and toss you aside to the gutter, never to be heard from again.
Don't you forget that, you insolent bastard!
Good day, sir.
Dr. Fenton, I think that we should discuss Jasper.
Leave.
- Shouldn't we have our meeting now?
- Leave, Eischel!
Well, at least that's finished.
- What is this?
- Hello, Uncle.
Has anyone seen this?
We have a dead patient, with a syringe in his head.
Welcome, Uncle Irving.
This is unexpected.
My boy, have you seen this mess by the front door?
I should figure.
I come to visit my nephew... what do I find?
Edward, there is a dead body on the floor.
What in heaven's name is going on in this place?
How long has that corpse been there?
Aren't there interns responsible for cleaning up such things?
To what do I owe the honor of this visit, Uncle?
"To what do I owe the honor..."
Should you have to even ask?
Is it unusual for your sole benefactor to want to see where you work, and what kind of work they have you doing?
It is truly not a good time now, Uncle.
The asylum has been under a lot of pressure.
Is that Dr. Wardlow?
Edward, you've been much too modest about this place.
It must be very important to employ an alien.
Hardly.
Good day, sir.
Wait, Dr. Wardlow.
You may not remember me.
I met you at the Governor's mansion several years ago.
- I am Dr. Irving...
- Uncle!
I do not think these men have time to chat with us.
Let us be on our way.
Hardly the truth, Edward.
We have all the time we need.
What is your practice, Doctor?
I am a family doctor.
But I've been conducting interesting experiments for the last few years.
I've just achieved a breakthrough in fungus.
Uncle, now is not the time!
Edward, hush.
I hold alienists in the very highest regard, as should you.
Well, Doctor,
I hold family doctors in a special place as well.
Without your practices, we alienists wouldn't have time to do the work we do, the important work.
Have a wonderful visit.
Not the right time, indeed, huh?
You ungrateful nephew.
I get you into a good school despite your questionable merits.
I pay your tuition, every damn cent, and you try to brush me off.
- Your parents never would've...
- Enough!
You took my happy home!
My happy home!
And your work...
I want to see where my money's gone.
They killed Brother Don!
He's dead, I tell you.
He's dead!
If you come, he'll die.
He'll be perfect.
He had no pricklies!
If you come, he'll die!
God!
She's saying to me,
"Piece by piece by piece."
Oh, please.
He was so fucking nice.
Oh, God.
Piece by piece.
Piece by piece.
Piece by piece by piece by piece by the golden fleece.
She's saying to me!
Piece by piece!
Piece by piece!
Now there is a man for solitary.
No wonder you look so tattered, Edward.
This place is as sloppy as a pig's trough.
Show me more.
I want to see your work.
You know, in my day, these mental delinquents were not a problem.
We just hung 'em.
One noose and poof!
Since when did they put interns in the basement?
Do all the interns work down here?
Do you have anything to drink?
I'm parched.
You nearly walked me to death.
What was all that commotion, and why couldn't I walk in all the corridors?
I tell you, this place is a miserable excuse for an asylum.
If I ran this place, I'd...
Dear God!
What is this?
This is my research, years of development.
Development of what?
Why would you have need of this?
Sorted mamalian brains.
It's deep, Uncle.
These took seven hours to extract from one patient.
It was very difficult.
Ah, she's dead!
She's not dead, Uncle.
She's far from it.
You just haven't said anything to her.
Are you trying to be humorous?
Come now, Uncle.
Say something.
You're upsetting her, I can tell.
Uh, hello?
What's her name?
Ardelia.
Hello, Ardelia.
- She's alive!
- Of course she's alive!
I... more...
What?
I... love...
What do you love?
More... more... faster...
- Fascinating.
- Dear God in heaven!
You are keeping a cadaver as a kind of a sex toy?
This is worse than I could have imagined.
It's unholy!
You're a bastard to the profession!
- You're tampering with mortality!
- I've done nothing of the sort.
You have, Edward, you have.
You will be damned!
I have harnessed the electric current of the brain, commanding it at my will with the flip of a switch.
Look at you!
You are a freak!
Sitting in your lab performing sexual experiments, while the real doctors move above you, saving lives.
You're a mockery and a misfit in the field that we... that I work in.
I am a pioneer on the modern thought of brain functions.
I have the ability to manipulate...
I know all about your manipulations.
Yes, yes, I see.
I know that you could never be a nephew of mine.
No, sweet God, no!
This is an outrage!
I am more of a scientist than you will ever be!
Will you kill me and make me into a monster?
I do not create monsters.
I channel the human brain.
I can create thoughts where thoughts never existed.
I can take a vegetable mind and make it live again.
In my hands, the brain can think, where in others it's tossed aside like a wasted piece of tissue in haste.
You've brought nothing but shame upon the family.
Today, you are dead to us!
I can even monitor thought with this device here.
And if I can help it, your days down here are numbered.
Playing with minds...
What do you think you are, God Almighty?
So be it!
Let me die to my family.
It's my profession.
They're all without hope anyway, trudging about with archaic thoughts and prehistoric philosophies.
Let me die to them.
Let me die!
They can all go to hell!
Go to hell!
Joe, I want to do some tests on you.
There's certain elements in your head, that, if harnessed properly, can give me a clear image of what happens inside your mind or shall I say, "minds?"
I know the drink.
I kissed my lovins.
Sleep.
I wake with bad things.
That is as I thought you would say.
But what of the other, the other inside you?
Why does that voice only get to speak on select occasions?
I wake with bad things.
No matter.
I will bring the voice out and meet the mind of your deformed, yet brilliant fetal twin, the one that's been trapped in your body for close to 50 years.
Let us begin.
Dr. Wardlow, I didn't realize you were in the middle of...
Oh, yes.
It's a far cry from fungus, Uncle Irving.
- Yes.
- What do you want?
My time is precious to me and those around me.
I come to you out of concern.
- You realize this.
- Of course.
Of course.
This had better be important, Dr. Eischel.
Yes, it really, truly is.
You realize... the brain conducts a million functions every second, and with those, a billion electrical charges carry and relay messages to the whole body.
To harness those, to differentiate between them... would give me the opportunity to read your mind like a picture book.
There are many matters that deserve our attention.
Yes, but it's hard to...
Speak plain, sir!
Do not waste my time with an old man's muttering.
My nephew is conducting experiments.
He's tampering with the human brain through electricity.
He has a live subject in the cellar of this asylum.
The scientific approach to this.
Sleep.
Just tell me.
I must sleep.
Tell me.
Who is Amducious?
Who is Amducious?
Sleep.
Who is Amducious?
Is that all?
A child tampering with his pet.
He... mentioned a new arrival.
- Joe Slaader.
- Yes, yes.
That's the one.
He intends to test his theories on him.
Why is his name written in blood on our walls?
Is he the man within you?
Speak to me!
What?
On my patient?
Impossible!
It's true.
The audacity!
That's it.
Speak!
More, Joe, more!
Am... duci...
More!
More!
More!
Am... du... ci...
No!
No, this can't be!
I'm so close!
You don't need to harness my voice.
I can speak just fine on my own.
What?
I would think by now that you would have overcome these eccentric outbursts at my arrival.
I am, after all, part of Joe.
So you are his fetal twin!
- You are the second mind.
- Such a simple mind.
You have not yet searched all your possibilities.
You have not yet delved into the deepest, darkest canyon to find me yet, have you?
You were the protrusion on his back!
You have to be!
Through a maze of synaptic impulses, the two beings have fused into one.
Joe is the involuntary being and you are his voluntary counterpart, the one actually in control.
You still are not listening.
Think, think of all the possibilities.
Then you will find...
Just tell me this.
Tell me, who is Amducious?
I am Amducious.
When you call my name, know this:
You call upon me, Amducious, master and ruler of Joe Slaader.
- He is but a host.
- Host?
I... am...
Amducious.
Joe will sleep now.
Wait!
Why sleep?
What is in sleep?
In sleep, Edward, is freedom.
When we dream, life becomes a world ready to serve.
All you have to do is desire.
My Bonnie lies over
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over
Lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over
Bonnie lies over
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the sea
Dear Christ.
Amducious?
Too much to clean up this time, Joe.
Too much to hide.
Damn it, Joe!
Why?
I don't think this patient will be any of your concern any longer, Edward Eischel.
Men, bind up the monster.
This... this...
He... he...
He can... it can be explained.
You miserable fool.
There is no explanation.
Your friend is a monster, and monsters must be annihilated for the good of the people.
No!
No!
Amducious!
Amducious!
Mr. Eischel, there's someone here to see you.
Dr. Fenton,
I will take responsibility for my nephew.
I will help clear him completely out of this facility.
Edward, it's not that we are holding you culpable in any way in this matter.
It's just that you're too close to this now, too involved.
It looks more suspect than it probably is, but we can't take any chances.
If we anger the community, we could be shut down.
You have to go, Edward.
There is no question.
Even if I tried to keep you here,
Dr. Wardlow and his jackals would be rid of you in no time.
Of course we understand, sir.
We're all, well, you and I both are doctors.
We both took an oath to care for the sick.
Yes, of course.
Thank you for your help in this matter, sir.
Edward, good luck in your pursuits.
Try to learn from this.
Dr. Fenton?
Yes, Edward?
What is to happen to Joe?
Execution seems to be the only option we have left.
Well, good day, gentlemen.
Edward.
Sleep!
You must to sleep.
I can't, Daddy.
I can't.
# Mama had a baby and its head popped off. #
# Mama had a baby and its head popped off. #
Edward.
Come on, Edward.
Come down here.
Down here, Edward.
We're down here.
Hello, my beloved.
You are long past due.
Quiet!
Quiet or I'll tell.
Let me show you how we came about, how our people came to your world.
It is in the word in the text, which you already know about, which you've been reading since the moment you met Daddy.
Enter into your mind's eye, Edward, and see.
Our great, great grandparents came across the stretch of water.
It was they that brought the truth.
It was they that brought the idea of really seeing what is already in all of us.
Through their rituals, they claimed their right.
And through the years, they bred one with the other, brother with sister, again and again to bring forth the perfect vessel for Amducious.
We all were once a great and powerful people, part of a secret society that God created.
We were the leaders of the whole world... but something bad happened, Edward, something terrible that we must never speak of.
Never.
That's why you will come to us through Daddy.
That's why Daddy is with you, so that you can help release Amducious and we can be the chosen people again.
My brains!
My brains!
You monsters!
They were perfect specimens.
They were my brains!
My work!
Nurse Calloway...
I-I suppose you know.
That you're not supposed to be here?
Yes.
- Is there any way I can ask you not...
- Not to say anything to anybody?
Yes.
Is that possible?
You know I've always found you to be a very kind person.
Never harboring malice towards anyone.
Well...
Of course, Dr. Eischel.
I can do that for you.
Please, dear, call me Edward.
- Nurse Calloway.
- Yes, Edward?
Joe Slaader, is he still being kept here?
Until tomorrow.
Dr. Wardlow's doing surgery on him.
I'm preparing the operating room.
He actually asked me to get more gauze.
Expecting a lot of blood, is he?
I suppose.
Dr. Wardlow,
I was not told that you would be working here tonight, especially not this late.
Is that Joe Slaader in the operating room?
Dr. Fenton, I really don't have time for another go-around with you.
Whether you approve of my presence or not in your dreadful facility is of no consequence to me.
No consequence!
I am the director of this facility.
What goes on inside its walls is of the greatest consequence to me.
And I am getting tired of the way that you treat me and the good people that work under me.
Yes, Dr. Fenton, it's true.
Dr. Fenton, you are the director of this facility.
Yes.
Yes.
The director.
Right.
And as director this facility has been the scene of not one but two heinous mutilations.
And to add to it, it has been revealed that one of these so-called good people that work here has used his position to facilitate his own bizarre and unholy sex acts.
Well, that can't be...
Let's not play this game anymore.
I'm tired of it, tired of the pretense, the official dialogue that has run its course twice over by now.
Let us just say what is in our hearts.
You are a fucking imbecile!
The idiot captain of a sinking vessel, a rat's ship that is better served as kindling.
The people under you are mere scabs, better to be picked and tossed aside than to be harbored and looked after.
Tell me, Dr. Fenton, are there even balls to cut here?
This is highly unprofessional.
That's true, Dr. Fenton.
Let's make this professional, shall we?
This facility is no longer under your care.
It's a crime scene, host to the two worst blood baths this county has ever seen.
By order of the court, I, as superior alienist, am taking charge of this facility until further notice.
How's that for professional, you useless fuck?
Now, get the hell out of my sight before I unofficially cut off your scrotum and force-feed it to you!
Bring in the patient!
Bring him to me!
This is mine.
This is all mine!
Mine!
This is my asylum.
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!
You think this is wrong?
No!
And you know why?
Because I run this place, and nobody can take it from me.
Nobody!
Get out of the way!
Move!
Move!
Damn it!
This is mine!
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
We're takin' the intern's belongings to the dump.
How much of it still remains?
Just the junction box and some wire and...
Yes, yes.
Don't be afraid of me, boys.
Mental patient, sir.
She was experimented on.
Now all she does is mumbles and drools.
Yes, I've heard of her.
Very well.
You may go now.
Do no further work until tomorrow.
Do you understand me?
Right.
This shall be a treat.
Hello, my little lambkin.
Oh, a vegetable.
So this is Eischel's bitch.
Another one that has fallen out of Wardlow's control.
And what would Wardlow do with you,
I wonder.
Oh, come, my lovekin.
We dance the night away.
But how could he schtump her?
Or do such...
But he is a fool.
It is impossible!
What is that commotion?
They, they say he awakened right before they, they brought him in, and they pumped him with another vial of sleepers.
Impossible.
I prepped him with enough sleepers to knock him out for the winter.
Pull back the sheet.
I want to look at him.
What is this?
Yes, I can see why you appealed so much to the young intern.
But I am certain you have yet to feel a real man.
We need a safe place to go.
How can this be?
How can I be surrounded by such imbeciles?
Perhaps a visual is needed to stun you morons into comprehension.
Out of my way.
Move!
Out of the way!
Move!
Joe.
Joe!
I'm looking for you, Joe!
Come out!
I want to help you with that fester on your back!
Where is he?
Joe.
I don't have a lot of time.
So I'm gonna have to explain as I proceed.
I've been to your village.
Did you hear me?
Have you any idea that I'm even here?
Sleepers.
It's simple, really.
The drill bit, breaks through your scalp and funnels a hole an inch deep.
And then, this dips into your skull... and lifts out your bone fragment.
Simple.
You see, if Amducious won't come to me, then I will come to Amducious.
I know who you are, Joe.
That's right.
They've been waiting for you for many years.
I understand this now.
Don't worry.
The blood will stop.
Letting your brain breathe for the first time.
The brain needs air.
Releases the pressure.
It gives us more power.
Barnard!
Dr. Wardlow.
Good.
Where's Dr. Fenton?
Ah, Barnard.
Perfect timing.
It is time, Amducious.
It is time for you and I to become one.
Come with me.
Come see what real science is.
You're covered in blood!
For you to reveal the hidden mysteries of the universe to me.
I want to feel the power of the ages.
Of course I am, Barnard!
Of course.
Please!
Shut up!
Or I won't tell you, silly.

At long last.
The bridge between the dream realm of the mind and the real world of the flesh.
Come, Amducious!
I was born for this day.
For Amducious!

Come to me, my love.
Let us serve our one true master, our one and only God.
Dr. Fenton.
It is now I who am all powerful and you who are powerless!
You shall now serve me!
Daddy.
Daddy.
No, wait.
You shall now serve Amducious.
Eischel!
At last your madness is revealed.
It is just as I expected.
What do you know from madness, Dr. Wardlow?
I am the only judge of that now.
And soon you will understand all too well.
Ah.
The little Missis.
That's quite a head wound you have there, my dear.
But, Edward, I must say, an excellent specimen.
Do not mock what we have done here.
All your power is now gone, and you will finally see true power.
This is what you would have ruined had you had your way with Joe, destroying that ultimate power that resides in his back.
You imbecile!
You fool!
Make him bow before me, my dear, for soon he will not have a head to bow before my master.
Look around you at these nine heads, all connected.
Their brains linked through one strong unbreakable current, linked to this vessel that carries my master that will soon be linked to me.
As you can see, one pole is vacant.
One more brain is necessary for the full power of Amducious to be released.
This is not science, Edward!
This is madness!
What you've set up is only an altar to yourself and to your own insanity!
You know nothing of control, Edward.
I have controlled this place up until now.
You see, you have only let this place have control over you!
This will ruin you!
Listen to me, Edward!
You cannot do this to my asylum!
You might still have a chance at this place if you just let me go.
I order you, Eischel.
Let me go!
Let you go?
Are you blind?
What more do you need to see to recognize the true authority here?
Well, now the rest shall be revealed.
You see?
I am the messenger of Amducious!
Amducious!
Amducious!
Amducious!
Be my messenger bringing the wrath of the Grand Duke of Hades upon them all.
For now, you must realize that the only thing more powerful than the mind is me.
Bring me forth, Edward.
Bring me the simple dreams of men's minds and shepherd me into true reality.
I want to feel the mind of my victim.
And now for your part, sir.
You shall be the final connection between my master and I.
Through your foolish gray matter, the power of my lord will pass through to me and be free from the prison of the dream world!
Free to walk the earth.
Freedom.
Freedom.
Daddy's free.
Amducious, no!
No, it can't be!
It can't be.
Please!
No!
Your work here is finished!
Amducious.
Yes.
Sleep.
# Mama had a baby, # # and its head popped off. #
# Mama had a baby, # # and its head popped off. #
Daddy.
Daddy.
Sleep.
Listen.
Go to sleep.
- Dr. Barnard.
- Yes?
Um, I'm new on this floor, and, well, I was sort of curious about this man.
Curious.
Really.
I wouldn't worry about him.
Well, I was particularly interested in his drug regimen.
Seems that he's on a great deal of stimulants.
Quite an excessive amount, actually.
Yes.
An extremely excessive amount, and I'd like to keep it that way.
But, sir, I don't understand.
His name is Edward Eischel, and he's been awake for two years straight.
Don't ever let him fall asleep, young man, at all cost.
He must never sleep.
Had I known who I had been put in charge of that day, had I known all the dreadful truth,
I can't say I would've stayed here.
Dr. Barnard had established a new order in the asylum, it's true.
But there was still much darkness in this place, more than Barnard, myself, or anyone else could've swept away and covered up with some new white paint.
No, the world, we like to think lies safely beyond the walls of sleep and in some other plane of existence had slipped ever so briefly into this one.
A man can endure many things, more than most of us like to think he can.
He can live without food and water for months.
He can live through the most ravaging disease, brave the harshest of elements, and live without almost anything most of us would consider a necessity.
But the one thing he can't live without, no matter how hard he tries is sleep.
You could have waited inside.
I want to see this myself.
It's the end of our journey.
We're finally here, huh?
Right.
I'm positive we'll find out what you are.
You're not the only one who's anxious.
Re-l...
Take the helm!
We're in Mosk.
It's empty.
This goes beyond anything I've ever seen.
Mosk was destroyed during the invasion by Romdeau.
I wonder if Vincent would hold a grudge if he knew.
The light... maybe it was the light that burned Mosk to the ground... in order to wipe out my past.
The place wasn't destroyed yesterday.
That's right.
Did my grandfather send the light as well?
Why now?
Is he trying to capture another Proxy?
What's happening in Romdeau?
Vince.
Cheer up!
Yeah.
We only just got here.
You're right.
sign of the end
Citizen Number 039666.
Raul Creed.
Present.
How could a model fellow citizen have created such a mess?
You completely overestimated your abilities.
To have taken such liberties with the system.
If only you hadn't made this mistake.
Mistake?
It's the same for you, isn't it?
Are you unable to face up to your own crime as well?
Shifting the blame.
A typical defensive response.
If it weren't a mistake... then there would be no need to atone for accepting the immigrants.
It is a fellow citizen's duty to reach out to the weak.
That lack of resolve is what led us to this predicament.
This entire tragedy began with the admittance of that man, Vincent Law.
Am I wrong?
Are you all right?
Yes...
This looks like it was the city's center.
I don't know.
Were you too lowly a citizen to even know where the city's center was?
I don't know.
That's a joke.
I know.
Vince?
Something you ate or someone you met... anything you remember might help.
Nothing's coming to me.
Nothing.
Take your time.
There's no need to blame your present self.
Come on.
Let's go.
Could you leave me alone for a little bit?
Vincent?
If you're not feeling well, go back to the ship.
If I find any clues I'll come back too.
Right.
Using Rapture was not a crime.
Not only did you invent the erroneous name "Rapture"... for a simple thermonuclear bomb... you sealed it away for future use.
Those are the true crimes worthy of condemnation.
It is the repeating of past mistakes which is your crime.
Your former selves sought God and were betrayed.
Not me.
I don't seek some God who won't save us.
I simply destroy.
You seek further destruction?
How will bringing further death and confusion to this world change anything?
There is a victor, therefore there must also be a loser.
Even if our downfall is inevitable...
Romdeau will not perish as long as we resist.
Such idiocy.
There is no way to escape this path.
Seeing the road to ruin as inexorable is tantamount to death?
To wait and see is to commit slow suicide.
It's easy to drown in the soothing waters of despair... however, we have to change!
We must be able to do without God from now on!
I do not know despair.
Resist, therefore Romdeau is.
Is that it?
In that case, go ahead.
Try it your way.
You're sparing me, aren't you?
So I can suffer with you.
Let's go.
Yes, sir, Chief.
Raul... you will soon know...
Our even deeper...
Our even sadder...
Our true despair.
The city's been wiped out... just like my memory.
It's the place where I was born... where I became who I am.
And yet, even so, I can't remember anything.
I wonder if I'd be able to remember if I turned into him.
Don't fall.
I'm fine!
Hey, Vince!
Hey!
Vince!
I can't believe you're able to see him from this far.
Hey!
Let's leave him alone.
OK.
What can you see up there?
It must be the egg.
Yeah.
And inside there's supposed to be lots of precious round things... like children, or food, or dreams.
That's from the picture book, right?
Uh-huh.
This is the first time I've seen it.
It was important enough to have been protected with all these shields.
We called it the Monad Proxy.
Monad?
It was something we plundered from the Mosk Dome.
Perhaps the Monad Proxy was located inside there.
Do I not have memories?
If not, can I even say I'm me?
There's something here.
Don't worry.
This place is scary.
For some reason, the place brings back memories for me.
It reminds me of my grandfather's room.
I was always nervous whenever I was summoned there... but now I feel nostalgic.
Did your grandfather praise you?
No.
Poor Re-l.
Was the Proxy here?
Romdeau invaded Mosk and seized the Monad Proxy by force.
Why can't we live without a Proxy?
Why did Romdeau have to get a Proxy from someplace else?
What did the Proxy look out upon from here?
Pulse!
Why did Vince forget?
I wouldn't have forgotten.
We'd lose our minds if we remembered everything.
Vince had a hard time, didn't he?
Maybe forgetting was his mind's instinctive way of protecting itself.
But if his memory holds the truth...
If only the power supply were still working.
Power?
Some place we could charge your battery.
That's here.
What?
There's power here.
Why didn't you say so earlier?
Why didn't you ask earlier?
All right!
I guess not.
I got it!
It's all in Pino's head now.
The one who's permitted to open the door... of course, I remember.
I've been waiting for you... my honored guest.
What did you gain from erasing your memory and leaving here?
You didn't gain anything, did you?
That's why you came back.
Oh my...
With your permission... the one you assigned to be your memory keeper for this very occasion.
I am Amnesia.
Surely you haven't forgotten that?
All right.
Now, then... that which is divided must become one.
The precious memories you entrusted me with, master.
I was afraid they'd become indistinct, so I wrote them down like this.
Simply wait and tell.
If I were just a machine, it would be an easy job.
Those with independent minds lose their memory... as a safeguard to preserve their sanity.
Madness or amnesia, which would come first?
Thank goodness we met before it ever came to that.
I know.
Please bear with me for a moment.
Yes.
This part tells of the time when you met her.
Now then, without further ado.
No, no.
Don't worry.
I would never, ever allow anything to... harm the precious memories you left with me.
Something's strange.
I wrote it all down precisely, so nothing would be forgotten.
No, no, not to worry.
I don't know how many nights I stayed up writing...
What are you doing?
!
These are your memories!
Why did you come back?
Why did I have to keep them safe?
Why?
Why?
!
Vince.
Pino...
Re-l!
Vince is awake!
How are you feeling?
I'm all right now.
We found a lead.
I got it.
It's all in my head.
There's a power plant operating underneath the facility.
Are you up for going?
How long was I out?
Let's go.
I want you to make this your top priority.
Even more important than reviving the Proxy?
We don't need God.
We can't do anything if you're scared.
Killing God won't change anything.
Exactly, it doesn't change anything.
So, then we should change at the cellular level.
You can pull it off.
I'm not the only one who has faith in you.
You're funny.
Going to such lengths.
We're going to change, literally.
You're going to transform us into what we were supposed to be.
As you wish.
If there's anything you need from Romdeau, I'll take care of it.
Red string?
Give it back please!
Sure.
It's very important.
Really?
Sorry I made you wait.
What's this?
A replacement for Re-l Mayer?
Replacement?
This is the real Real Mayer.
Shall we go, Real?
He's starting to lose it.
This way!
Did they build this section... so they would still have energy in an emergency?
This place...
Do you know something?
No, it's just...
I feel like I've been here before for some reason.
Is all this scrawling on the wall some kind of language?
Can you read them?
No.
Let's not.
There might be something inside.
It's your thing!
It's the same shape as your pendant.
I don't believe it.
It opened!
Was that a key?
What is this room?
And what's it doing here like this?
Who are you?
Leave it alone.
It's broken.
Is he dead?
What happened?
Must become one.
That which is divided must become one.
That which is divided?
That which is divided must become one.
Like I thought, it's broken.
What's it mean?
Vincent!
That's...
- Re-l, is that?
- That which is divided...
To Romdeau...
To Romdeau...
To Romdeau...
To...
Ro... m... do...
He said Romdeau!
Hey, what do you mean?
Hey!
Say something!
It's...
What is it?
They match!
You truly are the mystery of the world.
You mustn't show that smile to other men.
Beautiful...
You're here again?
I thought you'd been wiped out.
Then you're a symbol of what I'm up against?
That's fine.
I will annihilate you.
You don't scare me.
Maybe it was a message for you from Monad.
Monad...
Then it was Monad.
You must have transferred your memories to her.
Because she loved you, didn't she?
It turns out even this place was a dead end.
No.
We found where we're supposed to go.
I saw the same message back in Romdeau.
The night I first met you as a Proxy.
That's why...
That's Romdeau.
Can we make it back?
We have to.
Vincent Law... what the hell are you?
Another pendant.
What is the same pendant doing here?
That which is divided must become one.
I wonder if that refers to Vincent and Ergo.
If that were the case... whoever killed the AutoReiv and stole the memory evidence was...
Let's go back to Romdeau.
Right.
I guess we're going back there.
The last stop on our journey.
We ran into many Proxies... but it wasn't any of them.
The message and the thread linking the two pendants.
Monad was responsible for everything.
The link between Monad and Vincent... and with the Proxy...
The answer is there.
I know it.
Smile Land.
It's the kingdom of eternal smiles.
All who come are taken into the world of dreams... until all sense of time is lost.
There you go.
Nice dress, Ryan.
It's not a dress.
It's a kurta.
Okay.
Tonight,one of our most ethnic coworkers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community.
What is Diwali, you may ask?
Well, to have Kelly explain it,
"It's..."
"It's so super, fun.
"And it's gonna be great."
A lot of gods with unpronounceable names.
20 minutes later, you find out that it's essentially a Hindu Halloween.
- You look so handsome.
- You really do.
- I love the material.
- I know.
How come you didn't get me one?
I...
Episode 6 "Diwali"
The catch 22 team Raceman
Okay, so between Meredith's minivan, and if I borrow Bob's Yukon, that should fit about 12 people.
I actually might not go.
- I'm feeling kind of tired.
- Do you wan make Appletinis and watch Sex and the City at my place?
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
I don't get why you won't go.
Did I do something wrong?
I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
- I just feel kind of tired,you know.
- Maybe you've got mono.
Maybe.
I just...
I don't really have anyone to go with.
Well, go with Dwight.
He's single too right?
Yeah, totally single.
100% available.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
I don't know.
Who's, uh, who's going?
Ohh...you mean, like, is Pam going?
Don't go.
They eat monkey brains.
Hey, hey, hey, stop that.
That is offensive.
Indians do not eat monkey brains.
And if they do... sign me up.
Because I am sure that they are very tasty.
And nutritional.
It's important that this company celebrates its diversity.
And you know what, Stanley?
Comewanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
Really?
You should.
It's fun.
I love the people here.
And if there was one thing I don't really care for, is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures.
And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend Carol.
Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus.
But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture.
So with out further adieu, Kelly!
You are on.
Um, Diwali is awesome.
And there's food, and there's gonna be dancing.
And, oh, I got the raddest outfit.
- It has sparkles...
- Kelly...
Um, why dot you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday?
Oh, um, I don't know.
It's really old, I think.
How many gods do you have?
Like hundreds, I think.
Maybe more than that.
And that blue, busty gal-- what's her story?
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Pam wishes.
Kelly, I'll take this one.
Diwali is a celebration of the coronation god king Rama after his epic battle with Ravena, the demon king of Lanka.
It symbolizes the battle between good and evil.
All right, all right.
This isn't Lord of the Rings.
Oops, sorry.
I started biking to work.
Josh does it.
And he lives a lot farther away than I do.
And also, it saves gas money.
It keeps me in shape.
Helps the environment.
And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Nice basket.
Thank you.
Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million.
And that's true, but it's also not true.
Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.
Here are some famous Indians.
Suahmanyan Chandrasekhar.
He is a Nobel-Prize-winning physicist.
Impressive.
Apu, from The Simpsons.
Hilarious Indian.
M. Night Shyamalan.
The Viage, Unbreakable, Sixth Sense.
I see dead people.
Okay!
Spoiler alert.
- He was dead the whole time.
- Just stop it!
- What's-?
- Oh, wha
Where did that come from?
Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again.
I need your...
skinny little arms.
Oh.
Did you shake it?
Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.
We have such a roller coaster thing,
Karen and I.
- Excuse me?
- Roller-coastery friendship.
Hot and cold.
On again, off again.
Sexual-tension-filled type of deal.
It's very Sam and Diane.
- Wow.
- From Cheers.
Yep.
Yeah.
And another thing about the Indian people, they love sex positions.
I present to you "The Kama Sutra".
I mean, look at that.
Who has seen that before?
I have, that's the union of the monkey.
Oh, that's what they call it.
This is the best meeting we have ever had.
- Thank you, Kevin.
- I find this incredibly offensive.
Well, I find it beautiful.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine.
But we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
Actually, she's right.
This isn't appropriate.
- Why don't I take these?
- You're not gonna collect them.
No, this is delightful, charming culture.
My Indian cultural seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature or to deal with culturally explicit images.
It's just sex, people.
Everybody does it.
I'm doing it with Carol.
Probably tonight.
All right.
I think you guys should be all set.
Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
Thanks.
Now, Karen...
Let's keep it to $20 a person this time.
Got it.
Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation.
Which...amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.
- You guys ready to party?
- What's that?
I said, are you ready to part-ay!
Isn't this fun, not wearing shoes?
I wish some of us still had our shoes on.
Stop it.
It's a disease.
I've...told you.
I thought you said this was a costume party.
What does that look like to you?
An Indian woman in a sari.
Hey, Kevin, it's a costume.
You just cool it, okay?
Carol?
Carol.
I'm a vegetarian.
What can I eat?
It"s all vegeterian.
I'll just have some bread.
You used your hands.
Oh, yuck.
What, a little too spicy?
These s'mores are disgusting.
They're not s'mores.
They're samosas.
Do you think they have any s'mores?
All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow.
How difficult would that have been?
So...you're Kelly's sisters, huh?
- What?
- Rupa, Neepa, Teffani.
Stop acting like such little losers, and just be cool.
Come on, Ryan Come on.
Leave him alone.
I hate you guys.
They said something about Zach Braff.
That's very official.
I decided to come.
I feel a little underdressed.
But at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right?
Is that mean?
Temp!
Temp!
Stop it , stop it right now.
Ryan is a temporary worker makes no money.
Wali is a whole doctor, so handsome, makes good money.
- You think I wanna date a doctor?
- He's a perfect match.
Hey, big tuna, you ready?
Yep.
One, two, three.
Shot!
Ohh!
Holy mother of God.
Ooh, that burns.
Golly!
Wow, thirty years.
And you two only met once before the wedding night.
- Yes.
- Wow.
How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
Oh...
She's not a cheerleader.
She thought this was a costume party.
Um, no, we're not married.
Yet!
She's very fair.
She is very fair.
Very fair and very kind.
So, tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die, she has to throw herself on fire?
No?
Okay.
It's still very cool.
Okay, thanks.
One, two, three.
Chug!
Are you okay?
I'm gonna be.
Hi.
I'm just gonna...
Just a sec, just a sec.
Everyone.
I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please?
Thank you.
Sorry, I just have an announcement to make.
Okay, I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight.
But I have learned even more about love.
And I know you're all thinking,
"Who is this crazy gringo, and what is he talkin' about?"
Well, I'm not crazy.
Maybe I'm crazy in love.
So, without further adieu,
Carol...
Carol Stills..
I would like you... to do me the honor of making me your husband.
Oh, Michael
What do you say?
Can we talk about this in private?
I didn't hear you.
Can we talk about this in private?
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Okay.
I get it You're not ready.
We'll wait.
- This is our ninth date, Michael.
- Well, yeah, but I--
I feel like I've known you many lifetimes.
- Maybe I'm Hindu after all.
- Okay, I'm not Hindu.
But....
Carol...
Carol, I just feel like-- I just like you so much.
I'd better go.
Okay?
You can find a way home, all right?
Yes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay
- Good night.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't come with you ?
'Cause I've got this book called The Kama Sutra.
- Okay, good night, Michael.
- All right.
Good night.
Well, I was a temp, but I got promoted.
So, the compensation is a lot more competitive.
So you're saving money now to start a family and home?
Oh, or travel.
And,and buy an Xbox.
Is there anything you wanted to ask us tonight?
Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public?
That is so Michael.
Is it?
He's really outgoing, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, would you excuse me for a second?
It's hot in there.
- How's the naan?
- Dry.
You looked like you were having fun.
I am.
You should come dance with us.
I have to watch our shoes, so they don't get stolen.
- Who are you texting?
- No one.
Andy, no a cappella
Oh, come on, guys, please.
Tuna!
Are you kidding me?
!
- Here.
- That's so spicy.
Yeah.
- You waiting for a call?
- No.
Wow.
Pam...
When Carol said no tonight,
I think I finally realized how you must be feeling.
We are both the victims of broken engagements.
Well, you were never really engaged.
I was in that marriage arena, Though.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
O hh...well.
I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.
We're so alike.
So alike.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm rejecting your kiss.
- What?
Can I have a ride home?
If you sit in the back.
Okay, guys.
Hey, can I have a ride, man?
I, uh, I have my bike.
No way, dude.
I am not driving home.
I brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions.
You're welcome to share it, though.
It's a roomy twin.
Okay.
Hey, dummy, get , the car.
I'm a drunk driver.
Yes, you are.
Here, let me take that.
Just, get in the car.
You can really hold your liquor, though.
Yeah, you can't.
Okay.
And I am just going to lie down in the back,
- If that's all right.
- Sure.Here's you bike.
Just don't puke on anything.
You okay?
- So good.
- Good.
These are not my shoes.
This is just like that s how Taxi Cab Confessions.
If you say one more word, I'm stopping the car.
Why not to Indians every where?
It's a tribute to one of the greats.
Mr. Adam Sandler.
There you go.
Oh.
Nice dress, Ryan.
It's not a dress.
It's a kurta.
Okay.
Tonight, one of our most ethnic coworkers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community.
What is Diwali, you may ask?
Well, to have Kelly explain it,
"It's..."
"It's so super, fun.
And it's gonna be great."
A lot of gods with unpronounceable names.
20 minutes later, you find out that it's essentially a Hindu Halloween.
You look so handsome.
You really do.
I love the material.
I know.
How come you didn't get me one?
I...
Okay, so between Meredith's minivan, and if I borrow Bob's Yukon, that should fit about 12 people.
I actually might not go.
I'm feeling kind of tired.
Do you wanna make Appletinis and watch Sex and the City at my place?
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
I don't get why you won't go.
Did I do something wrong?
I mean, I thought we were really close friends.
I just feel kind of tired, you know.
Maybe you've got mono.
Maybe.
I just...
I don't really have anyone to go with.
Well, go with Dwight.
He's single too right?
Yeah, totally single.
100% available.
Are you guys going to this Indian thing tonight?
I don't know.
Who's, uh, who's going?
Ohh... you mean, like, is Pam going?
Don't go.
They eat monkey brains.
Hey, hey, hey, stop that.
That is offensive.
Indians do not eat monkey brains.
And if they do... sign me up.
Because I am sure that they are very tasty.
And nutritional.
It's important that this company celebrates its diversity.
And you know what, Stanley?
Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa.
Wha... really?
You should.
It's fun.
I love the people here.
And if there was one thing I don't really care for, is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures.
And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend Carol.
Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus.
But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture.
So with out further adieu, Kelly!
You are on.
Um, Diwali is awesome.
And there's food, and there's gonna be dancing.
And, oh, I got the raddest outfit.
- It has sparkles...
- Kelly...
Um, why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday?
Oh, um, I don't know.
It's really old, I think.
How many gods do you have?
Like hundreds, I think.
Maybe more than that.
And that blue, busty gal...
what's her story?
She looks like Pam from the neck down.
Pam wishes.
Kelly, I'll take this one.
Diwali is a celebration of the coronation god king Rama after his epic battle with Ravena, the demon king of Lanka.
It symbolizes the battle between good and evil.
All right, all right.
This isn't Lord of the Rings.
Hey, Polly.
Oops, sorry.
Sorry.
I started biking to work.
Josh does it.
And he lives a lot farther away than I do.
And also, it saves gas money.
It keeps me in shape.
Helps the environment.
And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.
Nice basket.
Thank you.
Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million.
And that's true, but it's also not true.
Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.
Here are some famous Indians.
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.
He is a Nobel-Prize-winning physicist.
Impressive.
Apu, from The Simpsons.
Hilarious Indian.
M. Night Shyamalan.
The Village, Unbreakable, Sixth Sense.
I see dead people.
Okay!
Spoiler alert.
He was dead the whole time.
Just stop it!
What's...
Oh, wha...
Where did that come from?
Karen, my chips got stuck in the vending machine again.
I need your...
skinny little arms.
Oh.
Did you shake it?
Yeah, I shook it, I shook it.
We have such a roller coaster thing,
Karen and I.
Excuse me?
Roller-coastery friendship.
Hot and cold.
On again, off again.
Sexual-tension-filled type of deal.
It's very Sam and Diane.
Wow.
From Cheers.
Yep.
Yeah.
And another thing about the Indian people, they love sex positions.
I present to you The Kama Sutra.
I mean, look at that.
Who has seen that before?
I have, that's the union of the monkey.
Oh, that's what they call it.
This is the best meeting we have ever had.
Thank you, Kevin.
I find this incredibly offensive.
Well, I find it beautiful.
Well, whatever Kelly wants to do in her own house is fine.
But we shouldn't all be subjected to it.
Actually, she's right.
This isn't appropriate.
Why don't I take these?
You're not gonna collect them.
No, this is delightful, charming culture.
My Indian cultural seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images.
It's just sex, people.
Everybody does it.
I'm doing it with Carol.
Probably tonight.
All right.
I think you guys should be all set.
Oh, here's the corporate card for dinner.
Thanks.
Now, Karen...
Let's keep it to $20 a person this time.

Stop it.
It's a disease.
I've... told you.
I thought you said this was a costume party.
What does that look like to you?
An Indian woman in a sari.
No one's even gonna notice it.
Nice outfit.
Hey, Kevin, it's a costume.
You just cool it, okay?
Carol?
Carol.
I'll have one of those as well.
Thank you very much.
Now, these are limes, lemons, onions.
I'm a vegetarian.
What can I eat?
It's all vegetarian.
I'll just have some bread.
You used your hands.
Oh, yuck.
Oh.
What, is it too spicy?
Yeah.

They said something about Zach Braff.
Don't even listen to them.
No, you know...
That's very official.

Uh, I feel a little underdressed.
But at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right?

Ryan is a temporary worker, makes no money.
Wali is a whole doctor, so handsome, makes good money.
- You think I wanna date a doctor?
- He's a perfect match.
Hey, big tuna, you ready?
Yep.
One, two, three.
Shot!
Ohh!
Holy mother of God.
Ooh, that burns.
Golly!
Good.
Whew.
Wow, 30 years!
And you two only met once before the wedding night.
Yes.
Wow.
How long have you been married to the cheerleader?
Oh...
She's not a cheerleader.
She thought this was a costume party.
Um, no, we're not married.
Yet!
She's very fair.
She is very fair.
Very fair and very kind.
So, um, tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die, she has to throw herself on fire?
No?
Okay.
It's still very cool.
Okay, thanks.
One, two, three.
Chug!
Ooh!
Are you okay?
I'm gonna be.
Hi.
